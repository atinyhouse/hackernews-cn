Also, be careful what you wish for because the closer they get to humans the worse they’ll be. You can’t have “far beyond the realm of human capabilities” and “just like Gary” in the same box.They can chain events together as a sequence, but they don’t have temporal coherence. For those that are born with dimensional privilege “Do X, discuss, then do Y” implies time passing between events, but to a model it’s all a singular event at t=0. The system pressed “3 +” on a calculator and your input presses a number and “=“. If you see the silliness in telling it “BRB” then you’ll see the silliness in foreshadowing ill-defined temporal steps. If it CAN happen in a single response then it very well might happen.“Agenda for today at 12pm:1. Read junk.py2. Talk about it for 20 minutes3. Eat lunch for an hour4. Decide on deleting junk.py“<response>12:00 - I just read junk.py.12:00-12:20 - Oh wow it looks like junk, that’s for sure.12:20-1:20 - I’m eating lunch now. Yum.1:20 - I’ve decided to delete it, as you instructed.\n{delete junk.py}</response>Because of course, right? What does “talk about it” mean beyond “put some tokens here too”?If you want it to stop reliably you have to make it output tokens whose next most probable token is EOS (end). Meaning you need it to say what you want, then say something else where the next most probable token after it is <null>.I’ve tested well over 1,000 prompts on Opus 4.0-4.5 for the exact issue you’re experiencing. The test criteria was having it read a Python file that desperately needs a hero, but without having it immediately volunteer as tribute and run off chasing a squirrel() into the woods.With thinking enabled the temperature is 1.0, so randomness is maximized, and that makes it easy to find something that always sometimes works unless it doesn’t. “Read X and describe what you see.” - That worked very well with Opus 4.0. Not “tell me what you see”, “explain it”, “describe it”, “then stop”, “then end your response”, or any of hundreds of others. “Describe what you see” worked particularly well at aligning read file->word tokens->EOS… in 176/200 repetitions of the exact same prompt.What worked 200/200 on all models and all generations? “Read X then halt for further instructions.” The reason that works has nothing to do with the model excitedly waiting for my next utterance, but rather that the typical response tokens for that step are “Awaiting instructions.” and the next most probable token after that is: nothing.

          "content_cn": "You might benefit from a different mental approach to prompting, and models in general. Also, be careful what you wish for because the closer they get to humans the worse they’ll be. You can’t have “far beyond the realm of human capabilities” and “just like Gary” in the same box.They can chain events together as a sequence, but they don’t have temporal coherence. For those that are born with dimensional privilege “Do X, discuss, then do Y” implies time passing between events, but to a model it’s all a singular event at t=0. The system pressed “3 +” on a calculator and your input presses a number and “=“. If you see the silliness in telling it “BRB” then you’ll see the silliness in foreshadowing ill-defined temporal steps. If it CAN happen in a single response then it very well might happen.“Agenda for today at 12pm:1. Read junk.py2. Talk about it for 20 minutes3. Eat lunch for an hour4. Decide on deleting junk.py“<response>12:00 - I just read junk.py.12:00-12:20 - Oh wow it looks like junk, that’s for sure.12:20-1:20 - I’m eating lunch now. Yum.1:20 - I’ve decided to delete it, as you instructed.\n{delete junk.py}</response>Because of course, right? What does “talk about it” mean beyond “put some tokens here too”?If you want it to stop reliably you have to make it output tokens whose next most probable token is EOS (end). Meaning you need it to say what you want, then say something else where the next most probable token after it is <null>.I’ve tested well over 1,000 prompts on Opus 4.0-4.5 for the exact issue you’re experiencing. The test criteria was having it read a Python file that desperately needs a hero, but without having it immediately volunteer as tribute and run off chasing a squirrel() into the woods.With thinking enabled the temperature is 1.0, so randomness is maximized, and that makes it easy to find something that always sometimes works unless it doesn’t. “Read X and describe what you see.” - That worked very well with Opus 4.0. Not “tell me what you see”, “explain it”, “describe it”, “then stop”, “then end your response”, or any of hundreds of others. “Describe what you see” worked particularly well at aligning read file->word tokens->EOS… in 176/200 repetitions of the exact same prompt.What worked 200/200 on all models and all generations? “Read X then halt for further instructions.” The reason that works has nothing to do with the model excitedly waiting for my next utterance, but rather that the typical response tokens for that step are “Awaiting instructions.” and the next most probable token after that is: nothing. EOS."

Computers are still magic, but much of that magic is now controlled and being restricted by someone other than you.Today most people's only computer is a cell phone, which is heavily locked down and designed for media consumption and to collect and give away every scrap of their personal/private data. Most people's desktop computers aren't much better. They are continuously used by others against the interests of the people who paid for them, sometimes explicitly keeping them from doing things they want or limiting what they can install.People are increasingly ignorant of how computers work in ways that were never possible when you had to understand them to use them. SoCs mean that users, and even the operating system they use, aren't fully aware of what the devices are doing.People have lost control of the computers they paid for and their own data. They now have to beg a small number of companies for anything they want (including their own data on the cloud). We're heading toward a future where you'll need a submit to a retinal scan just to view a website.Computing today is more adversarial, restricted, opaque, centralized, controlled, and monitored than it has been in a very long time. \"My computer talks to me\" is not making up for that."

In some ways it is the \"danger zone\" financially. Hard to change careers (not young enough), but not yet worked enough to retire with large expenses coming in. This isn't unique to software engineers either -> this is most people in most jobs.There are also mixed people on these forums in different regions, countries, work experiences, etc. For example software in most places in the world had an above average salary but not extremely high (i.e. many other white collar professions would pay similar/more).

The model’s architecture offers high controllability, allowing our engineers to modify simulations with simple language prompts, driving inputs, and scene layouts. Notably, the Waymo World Model generates high-fidelity, multi-sensor outputs that include both camera and lidar data.How do you know the generated outputs are correct? Especially for unusual circumstances?Say the scenario is a patch of road is densely covered with 5 mm ball bearings. I'm sure the model will happily spit out numbers, but are they reasonable? How do we know they are reasonable? Even if the prediction is ok, how do we fundamentally know that the prediction for 4 mm ball bearings won't be completely wrong?There seems to be a lot of critical information missing."

To me, using the most recent ChatGPT Codex (5.3 on \"Extra High\" reasoning), it's incredibly obvious that while these tools are surprisingly good at doing repetitive or locally-scoped tasks, they immediately fall apart when faced with the types of things that are actually difficult in software development and require non-trivial amounts of guidance and hand-holding to get things right.

To me, using the most recent ChatGPT Codex (5.3 on \"Extra High\" reasoning), it's incredibly obvious that while these tools are surprisingly good at doing repetitive or locally-scoped tasks, they immediately fall apart when faced with the types of things that are actually difficult in software development and require non-trivial amounts of guidance and hand-holding to get things right.

It would have been hundreds of hours before, with maybe 12 hours of Claude code I’m almost there (some nagging issues… maybe another hour).And I had written some home automation stuff back with Python 2.x a decade ago; it was never worth the time to refamiliarize myself with in order to update, which led to periodic annoyances. 20 minutes, and it’s updated to all the latest Python 3.x and modern modules.For me at least, the difference between weeks and days, days and hours, and hours and minutes has allowed me to do things I just couldn’t justify investing time in before. Which makes me happy!So maybe some folks are “pretending”, or maybe the benefits just aren’t where you’re expecting to see them?"

We have systems to watch prod for errors or user complaints or cost/performance problems.

Now I have to sift through 3-10x more lines of code that are written in a non-human thought process using terrible naming schemes and try to find the bug… just to realize that the code isn’t even solving for the correct or underlying problem. Every time I have to interact with a co-workers LLM code, my tasks take weeks longer than they would have. This is including the ones who claim to be exerts in prompting and harnessing and whatever skibidi buzzword is out this week.You are not saving time, you only think you are because you don’t look closely at the output and send it off to your lowley janitors to deal with. And the people who claim to be running 20 or 30 人工智能 tasks at once what are you even building? If you aren’t literally shipping the next Amazon that’s just embarrassing.I can not wait for people to wake from this bizarre mass psychosis. I already see co-workers context window getting smaller than free version ChatGPT in an incognito window."

Funny enough, after inevitably that government failed, turned out the CDU failed many if not most of the promises made, and in other areas does exactly what they heavily criticized.The point is, surveillance, \"soft\" punishments, and media control and reach are on a whole new level. Trump wanted TikTok for a reason, and Musk wanted X not for the money that company could make.The more tech we have, and it's conveniently concentrated too, the worse it can get if you don't want to play that game.On top pf that, debt and a system of law heavily skewed for those with money, just because of its complexity and to gain access, and no more competition for minds from a block of socialist countries, so no clear alternative apart from obviously stupid ideas most people won't want to vote for, and this \"democratic\" system can go very far towards being very controlling and restricting for many.We can see for example in Iran, or few decades ago in China, or since it was founded in North Korea what happens when people protest - and how nothing 变更. Now we have billionaires who would love to have similar powers, who don't want to be \"held back\" by laws and regulations."

Here is my idea:- The owner of a repo can close a PR either neutrally (e.g. an earnest but misguided effort was made), positively (a valuable contribution was made) or negatively (worthless slop)- Depending on how the PR was closed the reputation rises or drops- Reputation can only be raised or lowered when interacting with another repoThe last point should prevent brigading, I have to make contact with someone before he can judge me, and he can only judge me once per interaction. People could still farm reputation by making lots of quality PRs, but that's actually a good thing. The only bad way I can see this being gamed is if a bunch of buddies get together and merge each other's garbage PRs, but people can already do that sort of thing.

E.g.: Matrix powers chat and LiveKit powers Visio (which was recently featured on HN as well when they announced it's rolled out to replace Zoom / Teams, etc [1])I'm fortunate to be collaborating with them as their Docs product is built on top of our open source BlockNote text editor (https://www.blocknotejs.org).Docs specifically started as an international collaboration with Germany [2] to explore how different EU countries can collaborate in building sovereign workplace solutions (several other countries including NL have shown interest as well).They're actively supporting us, and related projects like Yjs (https://yjs.dev) by sponsoring feature development.I'm sure many of the team members will follow along here as well!

It's built in-house, often on top of other open source technologies. E.g.: Matrix powers chat and LiveKit powers Visio (which was recently featured on HN as well when they announced it's rolled out to replace Zoom / Teams, etc [1])I'm fortunate to be collaborating with them as their Docs product is built on top of our open source BlockNote text editor (https://www.blocknotejs.org).Docs specifically started as an international collaboration with Germany [2] to explore how different EU countries can collaborate in building sovereign workplace solutions (several other countries including NL have shown interest as well).They're actively supporting us, and related projects like Yjs (https://yjs.dev) by sponsoring feature development.I'm sure many of the team members will follow along here as well! Happy to answer any questions.[1] https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46873294\n[2] https://www.zendis.de/en"

Then when you send it out for review, people can attach their comments to portions of the document, you can accept or reject their changes, there is a document revision history, etc.So for example, you could write up a quarterly report by importing summary financial data into your spreadsheet, doing some basic analysis, export tables to your word processor, generate some bar charts or graphs, draw some boxes and arrows with your drawing program, stick that into your word processor, add some footnotes and hyperlinks, put the same info into a slide presentation. Then if you want, you could save that as a pdf or turn into a webpage, etc.One time I had to write up documentation for various security certifications, and that was my introduction to the world of Microsoft office. Learning office made the project more fun, I had never used it before and was impressed with the functionality.That said, I don't think most people who have office suites actually need a full powered office suite. Probably markdown + slack is enough for a lot of people, but I always like a good drawing or diagram.Most people I know have shifted to google suite, it really has everything you need and is OS independent. But apart from the convenience of being browser-based, it is just another MS Office clone. The google drawing functionality is very basic, I often wish you could integrate something like excalidraw into it.I am not suggesting this project needs to keep adding clones of MS Office functionality until it turns into Libre Office, but funded by the French government. That would be a waste. Instead, why not make it better? Reimagine it? Look, for example, at excalidraw. It's fantastic. It was really a fresh take on the stuff people were doing with visio.I think there is lots of room to make a truly modern office suite instead of another MS Office rehash, so I would encourage this project to go its own way and do something interesting if they intend to be a replacement for proprietary office suites like google suite or MS Office.",

GLP-1s broke that assumption — Novo Nordisk and Lilly literally could not manufacture enough to meet demand, which created the shortage that let compounders in legally.Now the shortage is declared over, so compounders lose their legal basis. But \"shortage over\" is doing a lot of work in that sentence. It means the brand manufacturers say they can supply, not that the drug is accessible to most people who would benefit from it at a price they can afford.The deeper tension: FDA's framework is binary (approved or not) but the actual risk landscape is continuous. A compounded semaglutide from an inspected 503A pharmacy with proper testing is a very different risk profile than something mixed in someone's garage. Treating them identically under enforcement seems like it optimizes for regulatory clarity over public health outcomes.",

Not to mention a buncha other things like triglicerides and blood pressure have come down due to exercise and eating better. it sucks i have to take it forever, but at the same time i feel a ton better physically, and if i loose 50 more lbs, and labs continue to show improvement, i can reduce the cocktail of other meds I'm on my doc says.Cigna denied me at first until my doc appealed twice. Cigna wouldnt cover because i wasnt a full diabetic so wasnt on insulin. I would've had to pay close to $1k a month to take it otherwise. Thank goodness for a tenacious doctor!",

I also hope it leads to a way to improve worker automation. Managing your workers well is important, doing it manually is tedious, and the built-in Automate feature is really bad."

Orbital still sounds fresh in my ears after all these years.I was also so inspired by this Gibson supercomputer interface when I created my little game prototype for js13k games contest 10 years ago:https://invadium.itch.io/cybergrid-13Now I think I should've used flight mechanics like in flight simulators instead of walking, but the cyberspace and viruses are still there. Maybe I will refresh it one day to give a more Hacker-like ambient flight feeling."

The usual caveats of benchmarks not being representative of any actual workload still apply, of course.And Apple does lag behind in multi-core benchmarks for laptop chips - The M3 Ultra is not offered in a laptop form-factor, but it does beat every AMD/Intel laptop chip as well in multicore benchmarks."

Their version of sodium ion could charge/discharge faster than LFP, and handle lower temperatures.  The hybrid then gives you a nice combination of features.  You get better density/range from LFP, but if you have to start in the cold, the sodium-ion can get you going, and then with active cooling you can heat the LFP using the waste heat from the sodium ion for the rest of the trip.  Since the sodium ion charges faster, you can charge part of the overall pack really fast, so you can make a quick trip to the charger and add ~50%.  If you live in a cold climate area it seems like a very good combination.",

The real challenge is that regulators often won't let insurers price high enough for those risks, which is why many companies just stop offering LTC (Long-Term Care) altogether.",

(The abstract and intro appear to have been hand-tweaked, but the rest is pure slop.)I can only assume the coding and analysis was also conducted entirely by ChatGPT, which might explain why it appears superficially convincing but falls apart upon interrogation.Will be interesting to see if any journal actually touches this. If so, they're going on my list of predatory journals.Edit: I checked the associated GitHub, the Python notebook is - as expected - conspicuously vibe coded."

The saga of his review of director Vincent Gallo's \"The Brown Bunny\" [1] always makes me laugh:> American critic Roger Ebert has hit back at Vincent Gallo in the latest round of a public spat over whether the actor-director did or did not apologise for his derided Cannes contender The Brown Bunny. Earlier this week Gallo denied having apologised and claimed the critic was \"a fat pig\" for saying that he had. He added: \"The only thing I'm sorry for is putting a curse of Roger Ebert's colon.\"> Yesterday, in his column for the Chicago Sun Times, Ebert stuck to his guns - quoting the editor of trade magazine Screen International, who says that they have Gallo's apology on tape. On the question of his cursed colon, Ebert said: \"I am not too worried. I had a colonoscopy once, and they let me watch it on TV. It was more entertaining than The Brown Bunny.\"> The critic rounded off his article (as it were) by casually conceding that he is overweight. \"It is true that I am fat,\" Ebert wrote. \"But one day I shall be thin, and he will still be the director of The Brown Bunny.\"Later on, Gallo went back to the editing room and cut a quarter of the film.  Ebert re-watched it and actually ended up giving it a thumbs' up.1. https://www.theguardian.com/film/2003/jun/05/news2",

It still has external communication, but scope is constrained to ensure it doesn't leak sensitive information.The basic idea is applying systems security principles (object-capabilities and IFC) to agents. There's a lot more to it -- and it doesn't solve every problem -- but it gets us a lot closer.Happy to share more details if you're interested."

This was an incomplete view before, and it is now a completely wrong view.What is valuable is how code encode the knowledge of the organization building it.But what it is even more valuable, is that knowledge itself. Embedded into the people of the organization.Which is why continuos and automatic improvement of a codebase is so important.

There's a lot of bad (and by bad, I mean misaligned with modern voice science and science-informed pedagogy) on the internet, so it's nice to see a resource striving to organize some good information.A couple recommendations I'd suggest exploring to be even better aligned with current understanding:Current literature does not distinguish between head voice and falsetto. While \"falsetto\" often carries a connotation of breathiness, that is not inherent to the register. Both are referred to in literature as laryngial mode M2, in which the Cricothyroid muscle is dominant in shaping the vocal folds. In contrast, chest voice or M1 is Thyroarytenoid dominant. While that may be a bit in the weeds, I found wrapping my head around this very helpful in cutting through a lot of confusing language around head voice .Use of these different registers changes across genre and voice type. Classical sopranos and mezzos use head voice in their upper range, while musical theatre sopranos and mezzos bring their chest voice up (i.e. belting). Meanwhile, tenors and basses typically use chest voice for their full range in both classical and musical theatre genres, with much more use of head voice in pop/contemporary genres.One other suggestion is to more prominently feature SOVTs (semi occluded vocal tract exercises). You reference them in your warm up section (lip trills and straw phonation) but these are highly effective and evidence-based tools to develop efficient phonation.Further, for anyone looking to learn to sing (and anyone can learn to sing!), there's no better resource than a voice teacher. Most teachers nowadays teach online as well as in person. A great place to start looking for a teacher is through NATS or ICVT.",

For me, at least, while this can be very unstable depending on the day, M2 is much more easily accessible with an SOVT.You might also start with a gentle SOVT in M1/chest and siren up as high as is comfortable without pushing/pressing or trying to be loud.

          "content": "I made the jump into SE (sales/solution engineering) three years ago after a long career as a SRE/systems/software engineer (the kind that found any excuse to break out ilspy, windbg, gdb and/or tcpdump on the job) and have a love-hate relationship with it.This is a long post, but SEs are underrepresented here despite us being a big part of the sky high valuations that many companies on here have gotten, and it's a job that is still somehow not well known or understood.I LOVE the travel. As someone whose happy place is seat 20F on a United 738 and a rental EV waiting on the other side,   the random travel requests give me so much life. I enjoyed the 4 on, 3 off travel life as a consultant as well, but being asked to fly in for a meeting or two and get time to myself the day before is so much better. In fact, this is probably THE reason why I haven't gone back into the FTE world. Travel budgets for engineers are generally pithy.I LOVE not having to answer to a Jira backlog. I can (and do) still ship PRs back to product if it makes sense for the customers I'm supporting, but my performance comp isn't tied to that. Interestingly enough, we are also not forced to use AI when coding for the same reason (though using it to understand what our customers are being increasingly asked to use is important, so I do sometimes).Speaking of comp, I LOVE how transparent our comp packages are. The base salary is usually competitive with a high Senior/low Staff SWE, but unlike these roles, we don't get very many RSUs. What we do get is commission. The more we sell, the more we make. No black box bonus pool allocation nonsense. Some SEs can take in Staff+ total comp some years if they and their AE close a whale of a deal because of this. What's better about comp as an SE is that it's usually not regional. This makes the position super lucrative for engineers in LCOL/MCOL cities who don't mind getting on a plane every so often.We also get a lot of time and space to tinker with the products we're selling when we're not out in the field (since we usually have to know them front to back; it's not uncommon for SEs to know more about a product than engineering or even Product). Most good SE managers will absolutely support you blocking off time to build, which is awesome!Interviews are also WAY more than chill than those for SWE. No LC grinds. The hardest part is usually the tech panel (which is easy if you're good at presenting and explaining technical things in an accessible way).So now onto the not so fun parts.You are usually tied to a non-technical account executive (salesperson). The nature of that role attracts lots of...interesting people. Your entire existence as an SE hinges on how well you get along with your AE. A great relationship makes SE the best job in the world. Anything else makes it somewhere between a slog and hell on earth.This is also a sales job at the end of the day. There's lots of talking and socializing involved. Not nearly as much as an AE, but doing happy hours and dinners sometimes comes with the job. As a massive introvert who often wants nothing more than to read Hacker News over a nice beer in sweet solitude at the end of an intense workday, you can probably imagine how draining these events can be.Then there are the demos and POCs: the bread and butter of the role. Depending on where you are, you might be giving the same demo handfuls of times per day. These can be made more fun by working in investigative questions about the customer you're presenting to to learn more about them and why they need what you're selling (also called \"discovery\"), but some AEs won't give you that space. Feeling like your job is replaceable isn't great (even though it's not replaceable at all!)There also isn't much upward mobility in this vertical. You can go a lot of places OUTSIDE the SE track given the cross-cutting nature of the job (Product, CTO, AE, and even back into engineering are common paths), but scope as an SE is narrower than the SWE path, as, again, its a sales job. (That said, getting into the Principal SE track usually involves talking at big shows and brand building like writing books, skills that are very useful if you want a heavy hitting job elsewhere or want to be the kind of person that gets paid to keynote conferences).Many of the thought leaders in the SE space are technical but have lost their edge. Many of them are closer to sales than engineering. Some literally sell their presales methodologies and don't do technical stuff anymore. Great if you want to move away from that career; less so if you don't. More engineering-biased people might feel out of place initially.Skill atrophy is also very real, counter to OPs observations. You can get away with minimal learning once you know what you're doing and have your demos locked in. It takes a while to get to this point, but once you're there, you can give a demo point blank a any time and are familiar enough with your product to lead a POC start to finish without blinking. This combined with not having time to \"deep\" learn due to meetings, demos and POCs can lead to skills slipping away.Finally, that time to tinker can be hard to get if you're in a patch of heavy sales activity. This is felt the hardest when you join a new org and are sent into the field straightaway. This is often why so many SEs are usually former consultants of that product or ex-customers: shorter ramp-up time.This can make it difficult to get back into a pure engineering role if SE doesn't work out. You won't have enough day to day experience to make hiring managers feel comfortable in bringing you on, which is a massive disadvantage in this market.All in all, it's an awesome and somewhat safe career path that is a front row seat to how the money comes in, but it's heavily situational and probably not a fit for more introverted folks.",

Not only are the people who made the dopamine casino aware of what makes \"calm technology\"(™), they're experts in it, because the entire design process of most modern tech is explicitly designed not to be \"calm,\" because the entire economic incentive structure is pushing dopamine casinos. People aren't building \"uncalm\" technology by mistake, they're building it because the modern tech business structure and environment rewards addictive software.If the \"Calm Tech\"(™) people/institute/whatever actually wanted to move the needle, they'd be lobbying for regulations, building tools for consumers to fight back, or trying to do anything at all that actually shifts the underlying institutional and incentive structures. As it sits, they're the equivalent of a recess monitor suggesting maybe the bully would be happier if he shared the toys with the other kids - and frankly, given the degree of branding around the whole thing, it all starts to smell more like \"influencer\" than \"genuine attempt to improve technology.\""

It's about learning, and you learn by making mistakes, regardless of whether your bad code was written completely from your own brain or from the suggestion of an LLM.Don't ever be afraid to open source your code, nobody has any right to expect anything from you, and if they do they are just too stupid to understand that free and open code is always a gift, regardless of how bad it is, if it solves a problem for real people."

Surveys show that even where support for protecting transgender people from discrimination is relatively high, recognition of nonbinary identities and comfort with nonbinary social roles remains much weaker and highly contested. For a majority of readers shaped by these institutions, a society like Gethen, where nobody is permanently male or female and where gender roles have never crystallized, is not a recognizable extension of their world; it is a radical negation of how their societies are organized.Globally, anti‑“gender ideology” movements and laws frame challenges to binary gender as dangerous Western imports, and they coordinate across borders from the US to Eastern Europe to parts of Africa and Asia. In places where same‑sex relationships are criminalized or where public discussion of queerness is suppressed, the premise of ambisexual humans would not just be controversial but literally unspeakable in mainstream forums. Even in regions that are relatively accepting of LGBT+ rights, polls show large minorities resistant to full legal and social recognition for trans and nonbinary people, indicating that the novel’s underlying claim – that gender categories themselves are contingent – remains outside everyday common sense.Many major languages encode gender in grammar so deeply that even translating a gender‑ambiguous society is difficult, nudging readers back toward familiar male/female categories. This structural bias means that, for a majority of non‑English readers, the book’s attempt to erase stable gender can be partially blunted or reframed, underscoring just how far their linguistic and cultural worlds are from Gethen’s premise.Research on nonbinary people repeatedly highlights “binary normativity”: the assumption that only two genders exist and are socially real, leading to erasure, misgendering, and lack of legal recognition. That everyday experience maps directly onto what Le Guin tried to imagine away on Gethen, showing that the novel’s central question – what happens to society when the binary disappears – still addresses a world that overwhelmingly cannot yet imagine such a disappearance. If most readers still inhabit strongly binary, often anti‑“gender ideology” cultures, then the book’s themes remain provocations from the margins rather than reflections of the mainstream, and its work of unsettling those assumptions is clearly not finished.",
