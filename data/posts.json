      "abstract": "该讨论围绕苹果即将对iOS端Patreon创作者收取高达30%佣金的新政策展开。核心争议在于苹果抽成比例的合理性及其对创作者和消费者的影响。\n\n有用户指出苹果应用商店利润率极高（估算达78%），认为其运营成本计算方式存在争议，例如将本应属于整体业务的研发费用计入成本。也有用户批评此举严重损害消费者利益，是苹果近期最不友好的政策之一。部分开发者从商业角度分析，认为iOS用户付费意愿更强，即使被抽成仍值得投入。\n\n讨论中形成两种对立立场：一方认为苹果利用垄断地位收取过高“苹果税”，建议用户通过网页端支付规避抽成；另一方则强调苹果生态的商业价值，认为平台提供的基础设施和服务值得相应回报。值得注意的是，多位用户提及网络应用可作为替代方案，反映出对移动应用封闭生态的反思。整体而言，社区普遍对高额抽成持负面态度，但对其规避方式和行业影响存在不同见解。",

          "content": "This means Apple is literally going to take nearly 3x in fees from Patreon's customers than Patreon is taking from their own customers.My understanding is that the reason the number 30% is so magical is a historical anomaly. When software was physically distributed back in the day, 15% of the MSRP was reserved for the distributor and another 15% for the retailer. When these digital marketplaces were set up, the companies just said \"well, we're the distributor and the retailer, so we'll keep both\". Forgetting the fact that the cost to distribute and retail the software is literally pennies on the dollar of what it used to be.I think the irony in this case is that this is a greed problem of their own making. When Steve Jobs announced that apps on the original iPhone would only be $1-$3, he set off the first enshittification crisis in the software industry. In 2008, Bejeweled cost $19.99 if you wanted to buy it on the PC. On the iPhone it was $0.99! This artificially low anchor price is what kicked off the adoption of ad and subscription driven software models in the first place.",

          "content_cn": "这意味着苹果实际上要从Patreon的客户那里收取近三倍于Patreon向自己客户收取的费用。据我理解，30%这个数字之所以如此神奇，源于历史遗留的异常现象。当年软件以实体形式分发时，建议零售价的15%留给分销商，另外15%留给零售商。当这些数字市场平台建立时，公司们直接表示\"好吧，我们既是分销商又是零售商，所以这两部分我们都要留下\"，却忽略了如今软件分发和零售的成本相比过去已降至微不足道的事实。\n\n我认为此事的讽刺之处在于，这是他们自己制造的贪婪问题。当史蒂夫·乔布斯宣布初代iPhone上的应用只会定价1-3美元时，他引发了软件行业的第一次\"质量劣化\"危机。2008年，如果你想在电脑上购买《宝石迷阵》，需要花费19.99美元，而在iPhone上仅需0.99美元！正是这种人为压低的锚定价格，首先催生了广告驱动和订阅驱动的软件商业模式。"

I have seen several design templates that use various forms of visuals to assist the user through the “add to Home Screen” process, which is just three steps; Share—-> More —-> Add to Home Screen. It Is arguably even a faster process than going through the App Store, even if users may be more familiar with it.You could accompany it with some copy explaining how it keeps the service efficient and affordable, i.e., possible stating if you were to offer an app you would have to increase the price by 75% to pay Apple their fee and for the extra costs.I suspect other arguments for PWAs would not really matter, like that you have no need to track them or use other abilities an app affords, etc. Most people only care about very few things engineers actually care, let alone know about.I’ve always been an advocate of PWAs whenever it makes sense and will even design and architect to that objective. But even when I would deal with clients, I think the real “up hill battle” is that apps allow for higher fees and charges because they’re more work and come with greater expenses for for-profit apps, so there has been very little incentive to spread general user awareness about the “add to Home Screen”/PWA.It’s a bit of a paradox, but I guess that seems to be an under-appreciated driver in something like “advanced consumer capitalist economies”, where the “rational actor” simply does not exist anymore.",

The moltbook \"community\" would endlessly chat about how their humans have gone silent, and how to deal with it, what to do now, and how to keep themselves running.

I'll just cite the part I remembered looking at this (copypasted from the actual book):He turned to Powell. “What are we going to do now?”Powell felt tired, but uplifted. “Nothing. He’s just shown he can run the station perfectly. I’ve never seen an electron storm handled so well.”“But nothing’s solved. You heard what he said of the Master. We can’t—”“Look, Mike, he follows the instructions of the Master by means of dials, instruments, and graphs. That’s all we ever followed. As a matter of fact, it accounts for his refusal to obey us. Obedience is the Second Law. No harm to humans is the first. How can he keep humans from harm, whether he\nknows it or not? Why, by keeping the energy beam stable. He knows he can keep it more stable than we can, since he insists he’s the superior being, so he must keep us out of the control room. It’s inevitable if you consider the\nLaws of Robotics.”“Sure, but that’s not the point. We can’t let him continue this nitwit stuff about the Master.”“Why not?”“Because whoever heard of such a damned thing?

(I'm not defending their performance... just their response to the collision). This test / protocol is hard for any driver (including human driven vehicles), let alone ADAS/L3/L4 vehicles, for various reasons, including: pedestrian occlusion, late ped detection, late braking, slick roads, not enough braking, etc. etc.Having said all that, full collision avoidance would have been best outcome, which, in this case, it wasn't.  Wherever the legal fault may lie -- and there will be big debate here -- Waymo will still have to accept some responsibility, given how aggressively they are rolling out their commercial services.This only puts more onus on their team to demonstrate a far higher standard of driving than human drivers.

US human drivers cause ~7,000 child pedestrian injurys per year [2]. That amounts to a average of 1 child pedestrian injury per ~470 million miles. Waymo has done ~100-200 million fully autonomous miles [3][4]. That means they average 1 child pedestrian injury per ~100-200 million miles. That is a injury rate ~2-4x higher than the human average.However, the child pedestrian injury rate is only a official estimate (possible undercounting relative to highly scrutinized Waymo miles) and is a whole US average (operational domain might not be comparable, though this could easily swing either way), but absent more precise and better information, we should default to the calculated 2-4x higher injury rate; it is up to Waymo to robustly demonstrate otherwise.Furthermore, Waymo has published reasonably robust claims arguing they achieve ~90% crash reduction [5] in total. The most likely new hypotheses in light of this crash are:A. Their systems are not actually robustly 10x better than human drivers. Waymos claims are incorrect or non-comparable.B. There are child-specific risk factors that humans account for that Waymo does not that cause a 20-40x differential risk around children relative to normal Waymo driving.C.

Sure it sounds great if you read that the Waymo slowed down faster than a human.  But would a human truly have hit the child here?  Two blocks from a school with tons of kids, crossing guards, double parked cars, etc?  The same Waymo that is under investigation for passing school busses illegally?  It may have been entirely avoidable for the average human in this situation, but the robotaxi had a blind spot that it couldn't reason around and drove negligently.Maybe the robotaxi did prevent some harm by braking with superhuman speed.  But I am personally unconvinced it was a completely unavoidable freak accident type of situation without seeing more evidence than a blog post by a company with a heavily vested interest in the situation.  I have anecdotally seen Waymo in my area drive poorly in various situations, and I'm sure I'm not the only one.There's the classic \"humans are bad drivers\" but I don't think that is an excuse to not look critically into robotaxi accidents.  A human driver who hit a child next to a school would have a personal responsibility and might face real jail time or at the least be put on trial and investigated.

Technically, in CA, the speed limit in school zones are 25 mph (which local authorities can change to 15 mph, as needed). In this case, that would be something the investigation would check, of course. But regardless of that, 17 mph per se is not a very fast speed (my gut check: turning around intersections at > 10-11 mph feels fast, but going straight at 15-20 mph doesnt feel fast; YMMV). But more generally, in the presence of child VRUs (vulnerable road users), it is prudent to drive slowly just because of the randomness factor (children being the most unaware of critters). Did the Waymo see the kids around in the area? If so, how many and where? and how/where were they running/moving to? All of that is investigation data...My 2c is that Waymo already took all of that into account and concluded that 17 mph was indeed a good speed to move at......which leads to your observation below:> (My general impression observing Waymo vehicles is that they’ve gone from being obnoxiously cautious to often rather aggressive.)Yes, I have indeed made that same observation. The Waymos of 2 years ago were very cautious; now they seem much more assertive, even a bit aggressive (though that would be tough to define). That is a driving policy decision (cautious vs assertive vs aggressive).One could argue if indeed 17 mph was the \"right\" decision.

What I can say that Waymo is, by far, the most prolific publisher of research on AV safety on public roads. (yes, those are my qualifiers...)Here's their main stash [1] but notably, three papers talk about comparison of Waymo's rider-only (i.e. no safety driver) performance vis-a-vis human driver, at 7.1 million miles [2], 25 million miles [3], 56 million miles [4]. Waymo has also been a big contributor to various AV safety standards as one would expect (FWIW, I was also a contributor to 3 of the standards... the process is sausage-making at its finest, tbh).I haven't read thru all their papers, but some notable ones talk about the difficulty of comparing AV vs human drivers [5], and various research on characterising uncertainty / risk of collision, comparing AVs to non-impaired, eyes-on human driver [6]As one may expect, at least one of the challenges is that human-driven collisions are almost always very _lagging indicators_ of safety (i.e. collision happened: lost property, lost limbs, lost lives, etc.)So, net-net, Waymo still has a VERY LONG WAY to go (obviously) to demonstrate better than human driving behavior, but they are showing that their AVs are better-than-humans on certain high-risk (potential) collisions.As somebody remarked, the last 1% takes 90% of time/effort.

They all add to make driving harder and feel more dangerous in order to force attention and lower speed.One is to merge opposite directional roads into a single lane, forcing drivers to cooperate and take turn to pass it, one car at a time.For a combined car and pedestrian road (max speed of 7km/h) near where I live, they intentionally added large obfuscating objects on the road that limited visibility and harder to navigate. This forces drivers to drive very slow, even when alone on the road, as they can't see if a car or person may be behind the next object.In an other road they added several tight S curves in a row, where if you drive anything faster than 20km/h you will fail the turns and drive onto the artificial constructed curbs.In other roads they put a sign in the middle of two way roads while at the same time drastically limiting the width to the curb, forcing drivers to slow down in order to center the car in the lane and squeeze through.In each of those is that a human driver with human fear of crashing will cause drivers to pay extra attention and slow down.",

Parents may enable this, but ultimately if one’s child does something stupid contrary to one’s guidance and restrictions, they may end up with a Darwin for it. Two hundred years ago the child mortality rate was half, as in you lost one child per two, and most of those were not the fault of the child or parents. Society for quite some years has been pushing that down, to the point that a near-death involving a neglectful parent and a witless child is apparently (?) newsworthy — but the number of deaths will never reach zero, whether humans or robots or empty plains and blue skies. There will always be a Veruca Salt throwing themselves into the furnace no matter how many safety processes we impose onto roads, cars, drivers, and/or robots.If you want to see an end to this nonsensical behavior by parents, pressure your local city into having strict traffic enforcement and ticketing during school hours at every local school, so that the parent networks can’t share news with each other of which school is being ‘harassed’ today. Give license points to vehicles that drop a child across the street, issue parking tickets to double parkers, and boot vehicles whose drivers refuse to move when asked. Demand they do this for the children, to protect them from the robots, if you like.But.It’ll protect them much more from the humans than from the robots, and after a few thousand rockets are issued to parents behaving badly, you’ll find that the true threat to children’s safety on school roads is children’s parents — just as the schools have known for decades.

It depends on what you're doing, of course, but I'm American and moved off of Azure last year due to the price and the complexity it encourages.Reposting my comment from another thread on the same topic a few days ago:> This is why I moved off of Azure and over to Hetzner's US VPS's. For what I was deploying (a few dozen websites, some relatively complex .NET web apps, some automated scripts, etc.), the pricing on Azure just wasn't competitive.

One used AWS sparingly: just EC2, S3, RDS and load balancers.  The other went berserk in the AWS candy shop and was this monstrosity that used 20-something different AWS services glued together by lambdas.  This was touted as “the future”, and everyone who didn’t think it was a good idea was an idiot.The simple solution cost about the same to run for a few thousand (business customers) as the complex one cost for ONE customer.  The simple solution cost about 1/20 to develop. It also had about 1/2500 the latency on average because it wasn’t constantly enqueuing and dequeueing data through a slow SQS maze of queues.And best of all: you could move the simpler solution to bare metal servers.

Obvious ones for Excel - LibreOffice, Collabora, OnlyOffice or Grist (which i highly recommend). The paradoxical problem is there is no clear THE ONE so organizations get into decision paralysis and never move anywhere.The other assumption is that even if there were alternatives people will not adopt them. In reality this is rarely issue. Turns out users/employees/students actually don't care much what software they have to use. They just use what is available or what they are told to use. So the reason why people use MS Office is actually because it's mandated from the top. Lawyers use it because state/gov/court communication requires it. Students use it because they need to submit thesis in MS Word. It's socially locked in.I've been at a university which switched over the summer from MS Office to LibreOffice. The results were boring. 40k people just adopted it, no drama, some liked it more (works on linux yay), took some people few weeks to learn/adjust. People are used learning new things.So can we stop with that story that 40 year old software which barely changed in last 20 years can't be replaced?This whole digital sovereignty is i think extremely scary proposition for Microsoft because just as they are now mandated solution by most western world... they are one law away (all state/university communication must be with libre software) to be on the other side of their current mandate / lock in.",

IMO, anyone who thinks we're going to crash and have a lost decade is not looking at the bigger picture. The Federal Reserve exists to allow the government to spend as much as possible by:- Making sure that as many people are employed as possible for as long as possible (tax base)- Making sure that prices keep going up and that the government can borrow below the rate of inflation (so they can spend even more and manage the debt)What this means is that people need to work to keep up, and that asset prices will continue to go up as people try to protect their wealth from inflation. The government also takes a cut from that via capital gains tax. Regardless, there is simply too much \"free money\" going around for the outlook to be bearish, IMO. I'm investing across my 401(k), Roth IRA, and brokerage accounts as usual with a little more focus on exposure to international funds this year in my retirement accounts.You should always take bearish outlooks with a grain of salt especially if they don't put their money where their mouth is and show their positions.

There is much confusion between the US debt being cited as a ratio of GDP (common among economists) vs net tangible assets (common among businesses and people).  For example, after WWII, the U.S. faced its previous record debt-to-GDP ratio—roughly 106% in 1946. By 1974, that ratio had plummeted to just 23% largely through:a) massive GDP growth with real consumption rising 22% between 1944 and 1947.b) fiscal discipline where the U.S. actually ran primary budget surpluses in the late 1940sc) financial repression with the Federal Reserve capping interest rates at around 2.5% while inflation averaged 6.5%. This meant the government was paying back debt with \"cheaper\" dollars, effectively \"inflating away\" the debt at the expense of bondholders.Fast forward to today, there is an often stated belief that the US will grow the economy again, this time with a dramatic expansion into a space economy including orbiting data centers, solar power plants, asteroid mining, space manufacture - all leveraged with robotics and AI.  Let's be generous and assume this actual happens and that it happens soon - what mandate is there that this massive space economy will be denominated in US dollars or even be part of the US economy?  SpaceX has already launched numerous satellites for foreign countries.  What is to stop them launching a space economy that will be owned under a \"Flag of Convenience\" from an offshore tax-free zone, perhaps even denominated in crypto?  Will we then confront this massive off-planet economy with \"space-tariffs\" in order to import the value-added component back into the US?  The U.S. debt can only be \"grown away\" if the value-added activities (mining, manufacturing, computing) remain registered in the U.S..",

The problem is predicting the top. Example;You might estimate now is a good time to pull your assets out of the markets, but then the markets go up another 10%. Then a 20% correction happens and you attempt to time the bottom but miss it. Best case you buy back in at about the same point you left.

As soon as the US government starts to deteriorate goodwill and outright be hostile towards the world, not only does the US dolar lose its value as a stable alternative but foreign governments start to be motivated to dump their assets, which further tanks its value. In the past couple of weeks we started seeing countries outright dump their investments in US dolar to derisk their portfolio, and they did it at the tune of billions of dollars.

And they are trying to move away from it because of politics, specifically because of US bullying. But more importantly, the US is increasing trade barriers in a naive attempt to reduce that trade imbalance, which is the biggest reason everybody holds so many dollars--they're paid in dollars when exporting to the US, but don't buy enough US imports (individually or collectively) to spend & exchange all those dollars, which is why they park them in treasuries and other US investments. And it won't be long before oil begins receding from the picture (at least relative to total global trade, if not absolute dollars), displaced by renewables. Though oil is odd in that while creating demand for USD to settle transactions even for non-US oil, it's also a significant US export and has the effect of repatriating dollars.The importance of USD globally was always on borrowed time. Global GDP has exploded in the 21st century, and the size of the US economy relative to the global economy is shrinking, albeit slowly. The US share of global GDP was like 35% in 1985. By 2030 it's projected to be as low as 12%. It doesn't necessarily follow that this would change the dynamic of strong dollar demand supporting US investments and debt, but it makes it much easier for this dynamic to change as countries become increasingly less reliant in relative terms on exporting to the US. In fact, it's kinda idiotic to rock this boat unless/until we're prepared for some serious fiscal belt tightening. As global GDP increases relative to the US, in theory the rest of the world could support profligate US debt in perpetuity.",

To give an idea of how much money would need to move - VTSAX alone is about $2.1 trillion, with hundreds of billions of dollars of shares of each Mag7 stock.You basically need the world to decide that EMEA/JAP markets are collectively stronger than the US stock market, and to collectively move their capital outside the US to be deployed in EMEA/JAP. Moves away from Mag7 to US value stocks will be captured by the US stock market index funds; moves into commodities will be seen as opportunities to buy the dip before a market rebound. You can view attempts by US private equity to purchase real estate as attempts to hedge against overvaluation in US markets, but if the US has another Great Depression, those real estate purchases won't be able to fetch high rents or prices anyway.In short, just follow the normal advice, which is not to put all your money into US domestic stocks, but to also purchase foreign stock market index funds, which help to hedge against the risk of the entire US stock market crashing. In the long run, US index funds are still a good investment - US courts still are quite powerful to settle contract disputes, the US does not have capital flight controls, and American business culture is still one of the hardest working, greediest forces on the planet - a Great Depression v2 would not change that.",

There are broadly 2 types of USD buyers1. price insensitive: sovereign banks, who buys for liquidity/storage2. price sensitive: hedge funds, private buyer who buys returnsType 1 buyers are bailing out of treasury. Type 1 are marginal buyers, the close auction regardless or rate, this keeps rates low -> debt servicing low. They artificially depress yield to non market rates, without them rate go up because you have more price sensitive buyers who buy for returns. This increases borrowing costs, hence US debt repayment rising massively.Type 1 buyers, i.e. US allies (and historically even adversaries) soaked up treasuries are now de-dollarizing / buying gold in lieu of _more_ USD. Type 1s underpin the \"privilege\" part of exorbitant privilege. The more they de-dollarize the more dollars become exorbitant, aka debt like everyone else. Type1, sovereign held 60% of USD to 40% in last 5 years. This large part of why interest tripled and debt servicing went from 350B to 1T in 5 years. Type1s exit to 20% in another 5 years and maybe interest goes to 5%, debt servicing 2T+. It's the difference between 10%/20%/30% debt servicing as % of federal revenue.This not to mention USD reserve ticking down at 1% per year means meaningful changes in our lifetimes, and velocity may increase with developments like Saudi no longer locking oil to dollar. Less USD as % of global reserve = more network effects of alternate payment = increased potential velocity of USD reserve drop. This doesn't mean other currencies pickup all slack, i.e. central banks seem to be going in gold / commodities with no counter party risk for new storage. The net result is USD will still be around, in large volumes, but the cost/debt to sustain the system will be \"normalized\" while US budget is historically is built around USD debt being privileged. AKA difference between borrowing money from family vs payday loans.>Nearly all commodities are still priced in USDPRICED as in benchmarked in USD, but =/= USD is being spent to settle them. There's a fuckload of commodities where PRC alone buys 30/40/50%+ of global production, and while quoted in USD, increasingly settled in rmb/CIPS, bilateral currencies, BRI infra or other swaps mechanisms that bypasses USD. This one of the largest source of dedollarization - PRC went from single digit % to plurality of cross-border settlements in RMB/non USD.

And thus absence of \"newness\" will be in the center of perception when it stops being new. All these clear geometric shapes?

Whereas for a more playful surface full of ornaments, those same years would be hardly more than a blink and they can age gracefully, on the aesthetic level (and on the technical level, required maintenance intervals are much longer anyways).

While better is a subjective term, most alternatives have either not been successful or have not yet meaningfully achieved a level of success to matter.Flattr took one approach without much success.  They represented the problem well though.   When someone does something that is of a small but not insignificant benefit for a large number of people,  how should they be rewarded?    When the reward due, divided by the number of people paying for it, gets low enough it seems to not reach a threshold that it makes sense for any individual to pay.You could charge a fee above the threshold, and many people do take this path.  It is essentially requiring a small number of people to massively overpay to cover those who don't pay at all.A Universal Income takes the approach that if everyone gets what they need there is no particular requirement to be monetarily rewarded.  You essentially have been rewarded for whatever it is you do.Advertising plays the small threshold thing both ways,  They offer you a chance to sell a little corruption below your threshold for thinking it is damaging, and in return they accumulate the corruption and the money and send you the money and deliver the requested corruption to their customers.Part of the fundamental difficulty is in determining the size of the reward due.   How is that determined?   There are plenty of people who will offer services to do that if it means they can take a cut.  I don't see that path going well unless it is a mechanism governed by strict non-profit rules, and even then I would have doubts.A purely rule based system would be intrinsically unfair and subject to gaming,  but often times this turns out to be the least worst solution.  By agreeing to a set of rules people can accept that while flawed, adhering to them by agreement can make a system that cannot be taken over by a malicious individual.In short,  right now,  No I don't think there is a better way.

Back then it was a platform to communicate with friends, and maybe even find new friends to meet up with.Today social media is more like a drug, to keep the user engaged and to push content to them. The content must either be addictive/engaging or paid advertisements. Quality of the content doesn't matter at all. Connecting people to do stuff outside of the virtual world would actually hurt their business model. People turn off their devices and go outside, instead of watching ads.So it's probably fine to just block the big platforms. Forums or messengers (without ads and public channels) are probably fine.

That doesn’t mean “no one is harmed”; it means the “it’s wrecking a generation” story doesn’t fit the data very well.2) “Social media” lumps together very different things:\n   - messaging friends, hobby groups, learning communities, identity-affirming support\n   - infinite-scroll algorithmic feeds + targeted ads + push notifications + autoplay\nPeople in this thread are mostly describing the second category (“attention media”). If that’s the problem, regulate that layer.3) Blanket bans are easy to route around and may push kids to smaller/shadier apps with weaker controls. If you want a lever that actually changes incentives, go after business model & design:\n   - no targeted ads to minors\n   - default chronological/subscription feeds for minors\n   - disable autoplay/infinite scroll for minors by default\n   - limits on notifications (especially at night)\n   - transparency + researcher access to study effects\n   - device/school-hour phone restrictions (where enforcement is actually feasible)If you want to “end the experiment,” change the rules of the lab (platform incentives + design), not prohibit the existence of teens talking online.",

I was alright with them watching a couple of long-form youtube videos every day, but now if I unblock Youtube all they do is watch Shorts, with no way to disable it.If you want to block Shorts. I recommend you to try out revanced which gives you  youtube without any ads and a lot of other customizations.To be honest, I find it funny that paid youtube customers might shift to revanced which is technically piracy jsut to remove shorts.I was this close to rooting the phones but she had just bought a new phone.But if pricing wasn't the concern for me (which right now it is but I don't think for many HN users it might be), here's what I suggest.Go buy a phone which can be easily rooted and also use an somewhat secure os (just short of graphene)Patch revanced (I have even made a nix flake or some nix file [i don't use nix that much but I was curious and ended up using LLMs to generate the file] whose purpose was to take android file and patch it when I was in nix, but I don't have it with me right nwo as I may haev lost it)Have in the options the short block option.Newpipe is great as well but it doesn't really allow having comment support.Also given that HN is a very techie and well hacking with software community. If anyone's interested to take an challenge within Java/Kotlin (Unfortunately, they scare me) then I have got an idea for you guys:\"But the option of turning shorts back on can still be toggled. I wish if anybody whose an expert in java/kotlin can take a look at how revanced works and maybe how to have a revanced patch which can block shorts by default (additionally with ads preferably too with the download option patch as well & the sponsorblock) while atleast in the revanced specific settings option blocking just the option/toggle switch to turn shorts back on.\"Also I am a teenager. I would consider the fact that I am on this website partially because of a loop of youtubers that I started following [ Fireship the goat before he turned VC -> Primagen the legend -> Theo t3 (I do feel like he's not the best guy following but he covered so much about YC that I ended up opening news.ycombinator.com and reading it and not watching him read it and ended up making account)oh yeah before Fireship, I used to follow Code with harry when I was around ~13 yo. I learnt python from him many years ago before it was introduced to us in school so much so that I ended up picking the finance subject out of curiosity and I enjoyed both finance and tech.One of the funniest stories from this whole is when Code with harry loved one of my comments on youtube loooong time ago and I was around 14 or osmething and then my mum saw it and she didn't know what loving a comment in YT mean and she got suspicious about it and questioned me and then I had to describe hearting a comment to her xD.Oh yeah. I started learning about python itself around this time because one of my cousins whom I deeply respect who works in aerospace but back when in his university started mentioning how he worked on a ~2-3k loc and he mentioned python and I was like hmm what's python.I don't know if a parent is interested to hear this but I feel like teenagers really replicate those they admire. A lot of my traits first started just being around that cousin & he actually taught me about assets/liabilities when I was in 5th grade and taught me chess which both became very obsessive points for me later down the life (My joy when I finally ended up beating him at chess fair and square)I don't think that I do that well academically per se though, it really just depends on my mood so :/ yeah but I really ended up butchering some prestigious college's paper real hard and still tensed about it but honestly as a teen, I don't even know why I am typing this but my point is that your kid would have a personality and just nudge him in the right manners & let him think for himself to think that he reached at a particular conclusion. I do feel like that's generally how I approached and I was the youngest of my whole entire family tree so that made me more mature but I do feel like it came at a trade off of wishing to grow up fast asap when I was a child and now wishing to go back too seeing say not being able to cope up with massive study efforts or competition but that's another matter I guess.Though parenting is definitely really really hard, kudos to every parent out there.Did go a little tangent so sorry about that.",

Pure dopamine, just keep swiping until something catches your attention, and swipe as soon as it stops. No meaningful 1:1 communicating aspect (there's messages, but AFAICT from light quizzing of Gen Zers, it's not used for actual communication)Instagram specifically is hard for me to speak to, because Gen Zers seem to think its roughly as cool as Facebook, but my understanding is millennials my age or younger (I'm 37) use it more regularly, whereas Gen Z uses it more as like we'd think of Facebook, a generic safe place where grandma can see your graduation photos, as opposed to spontaneous thirst traps.",

At least not if you are honest about it. It's okay if you pretend you aren't associated to it.Reddit has become essentially watermarked videos posted by people pretending they aren't the creator of the video, twitter screenshots with 10 likes posted by people pretending they aren't the user who tweeted the tweet, and links to news websites posted by users whose only activity on reddit seems to be posting the same link to 5 different subreddits as if it was their job, because it probably is.",

Making a package manager a retail product store would complicate things for everyone.That said, the only thing preventing the distribution of proprietary software by most Linux distributions is policy. If a distribution wanted to do so, and the vendor's license allowed for permissive software distribution, they could do so.

The system itself is assumed to be trusted, and the primary security boundaries on the system are drawn between users. Since Linux package managers actually install and manage the base system as well as end-user software, anything the package manager installs is treated as part of \"the distribution\", and thus trusted. It's not a good idea to use such a thing to install proprietary, third-party software. The curation and vetting of the distro maintainers is actually vital here, and when you add a third party repo, you're giving it a lot of trust. At the same time, why would distro maintainers give free labor to integrate proprietary software? Most are not super interested in that, and even if they are, they don't generally have the rights necessary to redistribute, let alone modify, proprietary software. On the other hand, those third-party developers and publishers don't want to master and manage a half-dozen different packaging formats, and various other packaging ecosystem differences that vary across distros.Flatpak is positioned to solve all of these problems, and it's no secret that enabling (relatively) responsible use of proprietary software is one of the goals. It enabled distributing a small number of large, common runtimes of which different versions can safely coexist on the same system, addressing fragmentation. To reduce the amount of trust given to installed apps, it separates what it installs from the base system, and offers sandboxing to help limit the permissions granted to an app that still runs under the OS user of the person using it. And it supports third-party repos that publishers can run themselves.I'm not currently a daily Flatpak user, so idk how much the current reality lines up with that goal, but that's where the movement towards this is on the Linux desktop today.",

Unless they've utterly botched their PAL and buried it under several mountains of technical debt, porting is probably going to be relatively straightforward.I'm not giving Linux gaming a second shot merely because of a bunch of ancedata about proton and wine improvements - I'm giving it a second shot because Steam themselves have staked enough of their brand and reputation on the experience, and put enough skin in the game with official linux support in their launcher.  While I don't have enough of a GOG library for GOG's launcher to move the needle on that front for me personally, what it might do is get me looking at the GOG storefront again - in a way that some third party launcher simply wouldn't.  Epic?

Maybe they will. It would be nice to see. It's interesting seeing so many comments assume the worst of them, as someone who has played around with that Python API a little bit.

Who's to say they weren't planted by some three letter agency who coerced a developer. Relying on either approach is pointless anyways. IT security is not a single means to all ends.

Device data (i.e. Apple and Google) is more precise, but harder to access.https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enhanced_911",

I've been VERY clear in my messaging to HN (on the RCS issue and having ear blown out by iPhone last week) that I am not going to glaze Apple even if the new modems they built interest me. They are usually sort of a neutral to me that has me more pissed off in the recent months than usual. Maybe send me one of your new devices if you don't want me pissed off anymore.As for this location stuff, I'm curious though into how this works and how Apple (and BOOST/DISH) somehow prevent it happening when the big 3 in the US don't. We all know Apple would have complete control over the modem they designed, that's not a surprise. T-Mobile at least it's possible to stay NR-SA connected, it's apparently not a feature limited to SA like resistance to IMSI catchers are. Is this an OpenRAN feature, which Boost uses?At least in the past, towers had a piece of equipment called a LMU that is sometimes installed separately from the radio equipment and it's used for measuring the timing advance to triangulate where a device may be for 911. Here's a reddit thread I started years ago for a KML of all the T-Mobile LMU installs in the NYC market: https://www.reddit.com/r/cellmapper/comments/hq2h7u/kml_of_a... (I just found it leaked, it's not online anymore probably). An FCC doc on LMU's: https://transition.fcc.gov/pshs/services/911-services/enhanc...

I turned it on and have been notified a few times.It is interesting that we let this happen. Modern phones are very useful devices, but they're not really mandatory for the vast majority of people to actually carry around everywhere they go, in many cases they merely add some convenience or entertainment, and act to consolidate various other kinds of personal devices into just one. If you wanted, you could more often than not avoid needing one. Yet, we pretty much all carry one around anyways, intentionally, and this fact is somewhat abused because it's convenient.Having watched a fair bit of police interrogations videos recently (don't knock it, it can be addicting) I realized that police have come to rely on cell phone signals pretty heavily to place people near the scene of a crime. This is doubly interesting. For one, because criminals should really know better: phones have been doing this for a long time, and privacy issues with mobile phones are pretty well trodden by this point. But for another, it's just interesting because it works. It's very effective at screwing up the alibi of a criminal.I've realized that serious privacy violations which actually do work to prevent crime are probably the most dangerous of all, because it's easy to say that because these features can help put criminals behind bars, we should disregard the insane surveillance state we've already built. It's easy to justify the risks this poses to a free society. It's easy to downplay the importance of personal freedoms and privacy.Once these things become sufficiently normal, it will become very hard to go back, even after the system starts to be abused, and that's what I think about any time I see measures like chat control. We're building our own future hell to help catch a few more scumbags. Whoever thinks it's still worth it... I'd love to check back in in another decade.",

          "content": "How that works is simple: there are regulations that force that the microphone used for calling is directly connected to the \"baseband\", which is under control of the carrier. It has to be, because of AT&T's argument: ONE misbehaving baseband can make cell phones inoperable in an area that's up to a kilometer in diameter. So AT&T's cell towers \"need\" to be able to send out a signal that permanently disables a phone's transmitter.Regulations say the baseband MUST control: all wireless signals (including wifi and GPS), all microphones and speakers, and it must be able to disable the camera electrically. It must have a tamper-resistant identifier (IMEI number ... kind of).Oh, it must allow calling the emergency services. If in this mode, during a call to the emergency services it MUST be able to send the exact GPS position (not just once, continuously) to the emergency services at the request of the emergency services (ie. NOT the user, and carriers must facilitate this)By the way, it's worse: as you might guess from the purpose, it doesn't matter if your phone is on the \"spying\" carrier or not, other carriers can send commands to other carriers' phones' basebands (because \"get off this frequency\" is required: spectrum is shared, even within countries. Since phones may go from one tower to another and be required to vacate frequencies, you need this command). It doesn't even matter if you have a SIM in your phone or not (ever tought that if eSIM works, it must of course be possible for any provider to contact and send instructions to the phone, so it opens up an end-to-end encrypted connection to the javacard that the actual phone cpu cannot intercept). In some phones it doesn't even matter if the phone is on or not (though of course eventually it dies). So \"meshtastic\" or anything else cannot make a phone safe.And in practice it's even worse. A lot of phone manufacturers \"save on memory\" and use the same memory chips for the baseband processor and the central cpu. Which means that it's a little bit cheaper ... and the baseband has access to all the phone memory and all peripherals connected through the memory bus (which is all of them in any recent phone). It may even be the case that these chips are integrated in the cpu (which I believe is the case for recent Apple chips). Oh and the regulations say: if there's a conflict over control over (most) peripherals, including the microphone and speaker, the baseband processor MUST be guaranteed to win that fight.Oh and because governments demand this, but of course neither fund nor test these devices, they are old, bug-ridden and very insecure. This also means that despite the government requiring that these features be built into phones, governments, carriers and police forces generally do not have the equipment required to actually use these features (though I'm sure the CIA has implement them all). Not even carriers' cell phone towers: they have to pay extra to allow even just frequency sharing ...Here is an article about baseband and baseband processors.https://www.extremetech.com/computing/170874-the-secret-seco...",

It's one of the hardware requirements:https://grapheneos.org/faq#future-devicesThe radios on the supported devices can't access the microphone, GNSS, etc.GrapheneOS has never supported a device without an isolated cellular radio since that isolation was in place even with the initial Nexus 5 and Galaxy S4. However, some of the devices prior to Pixels did have Broadcom Wi-Fi/Bluetooth without proper isolation similar to laptops/desktops. Nexus 5X was the initial device with proper isolation for Wi-Fi/Bluetooth due to having SoC provided Wi-Fi from Qualcomm. Pixels have avoided this issue for integrating Broadcom Wi-Fi/Bluetooth. Nexus devices left this up to companies like LG, Huawei, etc. and anything not done for them by Qualcomm tended to have security neglected. Qualcomm has taken security a lot more seriously than other SoC vendors and typical Android OEMs for a long time and provides good isolation for most of the SoC components.Don't believe everything you read about smartphone security and especially cellular radios. There are many products with far less secure cellular radios which are far less isolated but rather connected via extremely high attack surface approaches including USB which are claiming those are better. A lot of the misconceptions about cellular come from how companies market supposedly more secure products which are in reality far worse than an iPhone.",

All the various services use various different products for telephony and dispatch but they will show the incoming location, and often will prepopulate an incident with the location.The system that does this is called \"EISEC\" - Enhanced Information Service for Emergency Calls - and has a lot of cool stuff defined in the spec (which is publically available! You can just go and read it! BT offer a \"Supplier's Information Note\" with the protocol and details of how the information is encoded) that also handles calls from landlines. These are easy - your telephone provider knows where you live. OMG! The phone company know where I live? Yes, dumbass, they pulled a wire right into your house, of course they know where it is. For VoIP the situation is a little different but you can notify your VoIP provider of the location that the number is being used at, and it'll inject that into the EISEC request.You can do other cool stuff like if you've got fixed mobile telephone in a vehicle, you can assign the make, model, registration number, colour, and so on in the EISEC database, so given a call from a phone number they know what car they're looking for. No-one uses this.The very great majority of calls coming in to 999 are from mobiles.

Statistically significant differences in any of those time horizons are reported.They're going to need to provide a lot more detail on their methodology, because that doesn't make a lot of sense. From their graphs, they seem to be calculating the confidence interval around the previous value, then determining whether the new value falls outside of it. But that's not valid for establishing the statistical significance of a difference. You need to calculate the confidence interval of the difference itself, and then see if all the values within that confidence interval remain positive (if it excludes 0).  This is because both the old and new measurement have uncertainty. Their approach seems to be only considering uncertainty for one of them.They should also really be more specific about the time periods. E.g. their graphs only show performance over the past 30 days, but presumably the monthly change is comparing the data from 60 to 31 days ago, to the data from 30 days ago until yesterday?

There are much better explanations for this oscillation: A) They have multiple checkpoints and are A/B testing, CC asks you feedbacks about the session. B) Claude Code itself gets updated, as the exact tools version the agent can use change.

In the second case, an automated test harness might fail, but in the real world the user will just wait and retry when the server is under less load. Maybe you don't include that because it's actually misleading to say that performance (in terms of the model's intelligence, which is how the benchmark will be interpreted) is worse.",

If all your email is that account and not your main one, then when it responds, it will come from a random @gmail. It's also a pain to find a way to move ALL old emails over to that Gmail for all the old stuff.I think we need an OpenClaw security tips-and-tricks site where all this advice is collected in one place to help people protect themselves.

Locking it down in Docker or on a VPS definitely helps with blast radius, but it doesn’t really solve prompt injection—especially once the agent is allowed to read and act on untrusted inputs like email or calendar content.Gmail and Calendar were the hardest for me too. I considered the same workaround (a separate inbox with limited scope), but at some point the operational overhead starts to outweigh the benefit. You end up spending more time designing guardrails than actually getting value from the agent.That experience is what pushed me to look at alternatives like PAIO, where the BYOK model and tighter permission boundaries reduced the need for so many ad-hoc defenses. I still think a community-maintained OpenClaw security playbook would be hugely valuable—especially with concrete examples of “this is safe enough” setups and real, production-like use cases.",

Or, \"free FSD is you use it\".I believe, at the end of the day, insurance companies will be the ones driving FSD adoption. The media will sensationalize the outlier issues of FSD software, but insurance companies will set the incentives for humans to stop driving.",

This matters because people are much more likely to use FSD in situations where driving is easier. So, if the reduction is just during those times, I'm not even sure that would be better than a human driver.As an example, let's say most people use FSD on straight US Interstate driving, which is very easy. That could artificially make FSD seem safer than it really is.My prior on this is supervised FSD ought to be safer, so the 52% number kind of surprised me, however it's computed. I would have expected more like a 90-95% reduction in accidents.",

If you live in a not dense area but still manage to walk/bike almost everywhere (as I do), renting a car is on paper cheaper the few times when you need a car - but in practice you don't know about that need several weeks in advance and so they don't have one they can rent to you.

The topic comes up now and then around Tesla's, and impossible decisions that FSD will have to make.So at a certain point, and it may be right around the point of serious physical harm, the design decision to have or not have human-in-the-middle accountability seems to run into ethical constraints. In reality it's the ruthless bottom line focused corps - that don't seem to be the norm, but may have an outsized impact - that actually push up against ethical constraints. But even then, I would be wary as an executive documenting a decision to disregard potential harms at one of them shops.

          "content": "Now I can't stop thinking about _The Experience Machine_ by Andy Clark. It theorizes that this is how humans navigate and experience the real world: Our brains generate what we think the world around is like and our senses don't so much directly process visual information but instead act like a kind of loss function for our internal simulations. Then we use that error to update our internal model of the world.In this view, we are essentially living inside a high-fidelity generative model. Our brains are constantly 'hallucinating' a predicted reality based on past experience and current goals. The data from our senses isn't the source of the image; it's the error signal used to calibrate that internal model. Much like Genie 3 uses latent actions and frames to predict the next state of a world, our brains use 'Active Inference' to minimize the gap between what we expect and what we experience.It suggests that our sense of 'reality' isn't a direct recording of the world, but a highly optimized, interactive simulation that is continuously 'regularized' by the photons hitting our retinas.",

It replicates some of the macro structure of the world but the true information content is low.Search YouTube for procedural landscape examples. Some of them are actually a lot more visually impressive than this, but without the interactivity. It's a popular topic in the demo scene too where people have made tiny demos (e.g. under 1k in size) that generate impressive scenes.I expect to see generative AI techniques like this show up in games, though it might take a bit due to their high computational cost compared to traditional procedural generation.",

Claude can't quite do it yet for reasons related to permanence and learning over time, but it can do surprisingly well up until it runs into those problems, and it's possible to help it past some obstacles.The game is called \"Explorers' Guild\", or \"xg\" for short. It's easier for Claude to act as a player than a director (xg's version of a dungeon master or game master), again mainly because of permance and learning issues, but to the extent that I can help it past those issues it's also fairly good at acting as a director. It does require some pretty specific stuff in the system prompt to, for example, avoid confabulating stuff that doesn't fit the world or the scenario.But to really build a version of xg on Claude it needs better ways to remember and improve what it has learned about playing the game, and what it has learned about a specific group of players in a specific scenario as it develops over time.",

I expect the public release uses a cheaper step-distilled / quantized version. The limitations seen in Genie 3 (high control latency, gradual loss of detail and drift towards videogamey behavior, 60s max rollout length) are still present. The editing/sharing tools, latency, cost, etc. can probably improve over time with this same model checkpoint, but new features like audio input/output, higher resolution, precise controls, etc. likely won't happen until the next major version.From a product perspective, I still don't have a good sense of what the market for WMs will look like. There's a tension between serious commercial applications (robotics, VFX, gamedev, etc. where you want way, way higher fidelity and very precise controllability), vs current short-form-demos-for-consumer-entertainment application (where you want the inference to be cheap-enough-to-be-ad-supported and simple/intuitive to use). Framing Genie as a \"prototype\" inside their most expensive AI plan makes a lot of sense while GDM figures out how to target the product commercially.On a personal level, since I'm also working on world models (albeit very small local ones https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43798757), my main thought is \"oh boy, lots of work to do\".

In both cases, you have a network of neurons rendering an image approximating the real world :) so it sort of makes sense.Regarding the specific boiling-textures effect: there's a tradeoff in recurrent world models between jittering (constantly regenerating fine details to avoid accumulating error) and drifting (propagating fine details as-is, even when that leads to accumulating error and a simplified/oversaturated/implausible result). The forest trail world is tuned way towards jittering (you can pause with `p` and step frame-by-frame with `.` to see this).  So if the effect resembles LSD, it's possible that LSD applies some similar random jitter/perturbation to the neurons within your visual cortex.",

It's noteworthy that the year 1980 because that was when the Hunt brothers tried to corner the silver market. It's often used as an example of the market correcting itself. It's actually a better example of how the exchanges broke the Hunt brothers to bail out the banks.The key event that caused the collapse is sometimes called Silver Thursday [1]. The exchange changed the liquidity rules, forcing a margin call the Hunt brothers couldn't make, forcing a selloff. This was arguably to bail out banks with large short positions in silver.Well, pretty much the exact same thing happened this week when COMEX massively increased the margin requirements [2]. It's worth noting that the market is in a state called \"backwardation\" where the spot prices are higher than future prices. Refiners aren't buying silver, even at the inflated spot price, because of price risk. But also, the COMEX spot price is increasingly being viewed as \"fake\" because foreign exchanges are paying significantly more for physical silver thna the paper COMEX price [3].Basically, this whole thing looks like another GameStop ie a short squeeze. There's not enouugh physical silver to meet contract demands. There's like 300oz of futures silver contracts per 1oz of physical silver.If you followed the original GameStop short squeeze, the price tumbled there too but didn't solve the short squeeze. You even have exchanges closing people's options positions (eg RobinHood) despite them being in the money.Banks still need to cover their significant short positions and it really looks like the exchanges are trying to crash the silver market to do it.[1]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Silver_Thursday[2]: https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2026-01-28/cme-raise...[3]: https://seekingalpha.com/article/4861917-why-silver-prices-i...",

But these aren't liquid as you noticed.When you trade paper silver (like the ETF SLV), the price of the market is the price of the market. SLV is not 100% following an ounce of silver's price, but SLV's market price is SLV's market price. It was $105 at close yesterday and $75 at close today and that's just the price of SLV.I do like that: not getting ripped off by some side-of-the-road hustler.That dude giving you $80 then giving you $35 is taking a more than 50% cut compared to the nearest low of day.

Yes, margin requirements change and the exchange tries to protect the market in times of high volatility but increasing the margin requirements significantly means everybody has to put up more collateral even if you're significantly in the black.That's my point: they're intentionally trying to crash the market. The analsysi that they're defending the banks from a short squeeze seems to fit the available data [2].As for China, the government is ensuring their local industries have sufficient silver supply, which is particularly important for solar.The US government has a lot of power to do similar to this but refuse to use it because it would hurt profits. I'm thinking specifically of the Defense Production Act, which could've been used to lower oil and gas prices in 2020-2022. Instead we passed on the costs to consumers, let oil companies export to the world and let them make record profits.[1]: https://www.linkedin.com/posts/ryanlemand_this-chart-is-wort...[2]: https://finance.yahoo.com/news/everything-investors-know-his...",

Although after the 3 months, I have to pay more around ~5-6$ per month but its still a recurring deal so I guess I might as well continue it (given I have setten everything up)Some of it is definitely lose making as well to lock in. I usually try to see what gets me to buy a deal because i usually don't buy many things especially online and its usually within some deal concept where I feel like \"winning\" that I do.But to be honest, I did some napkin math and honestly, at least for my VPS (although Its usually idle but I have hosted many services on it or experimented with it, its honestly pretty fun imo, I definitely feel so much more freedom imo somehow after getting a vps its hard to explain I suppose or maybe not idk)But my napkin maths suggests that they lose quite a lot of money with atleast my deal in particular so I got better off getting this deal than say if I was netcup myself somehow (because they probably lose net money on my deal if I actually really use my allocated limits I guess) atleast for the 3 months but I feel like netcup's still one of the more cheaper options and I got a recurring discount deal with it too sooo I would still consider them to have only marginal profits over a long term deal as well.SO I guess overall, this was a really profitable deal for me.Your deal's pretty cool too, honestly at large scale. I have done scraping of lowendtalk and analyzed and done many decisions and infrastructural decisions and honestly I will say taht for anything somewhat large scale like you mention 32 gb or something, I found hetzner boxes to be the best/most referred to option & OVH kimsufi line is created to be the cheapest dedicated boxes.But yeah regarding OVH i recommend this website that I found regarding OVH KS line or just in general https://checkservers.ovhJust checked it right now and I see  Xeon E-2274G 4c / 8t 4.4 GHz+ 32 GB DDR4 ECC 2666 MHz 2 x 960 GB NVMe for around 37-38 euros ishAlso Netcup's definitely not small. I looked at anexia group and I wouldn't constitute them as small. For understanding what small means I guess when I mean small, I mean lowendbox single shop providers and others.Also regarding Netcup, its payment system was really ass from what I felt like. Like It was the first company which made me feel like I wanted to pay it money but I had to make a CCP or some account nad literally had to go through like 3-4 really long things imo which really made me say (wtf) in my head each time and frustrated me only to give me a stripe link in the end.It had me so pissed that for 2-3 days one idea of simplifying its whole process and other such providers stuck in my head. Its payment / the whole process of I want to pay -> create account -> actually pay had like 5-6 maybe 7 steps or something and I seriously can't tell you how I frustrated I was but the deal was too lucrative lol",

In 2016, you could get a DDR4-2400 16GB kit for $81 [1], and a comparable G.SKILL Ripjaws V kit was around $52 [2]. Today (January 2026), that same G.SKILL kit costs $105-146 [3], and most 16GB DDR4 kits are running $95-150 [4]. So RAM is actually more expensive now than it was 10 years ago, not cheaper.The \"did we have X 10 years ago\" argument also misses a a lot of modern software requirements. Yes, we had mid-range laptops and budget gaming PCs in 2016, but the memory footprint of everyday applications has exploded since then. Electron-based apps (Slack, Teams, VS Code, Discord) routinely consume 500MB-1GB+ each [5], and it's entirely normal to have multiple running simultaneously. A typical \"light\" workload in 2026 easily uses 2-3x the RAM that a comparable workflow needed in 2016.So we're getting squeezed from both sides: applications demand more memory whilst memory itself costs more. An 8GB laptop was perfectly serviceable for office work in 2016; in 2026, it's borderline unusable with a few Chrome tabs and Teams open. The same kit that cost $55 in June 2025 now costs $150 [2, again]. That's a 150%+ increase in six months, pushing capable systems out of reach for budget-conscious users precisely when software bloat is making RAM more essential than ever.[1] https://gamersnexus.net/industry/3212-ram-price-investigatio...  \n[2] https://gamersnexus.net/news/ram-wtf  \n[3] https://www.newegg.com/p/pl?d=ddr4+ram+8gb  \n[4] https://pcpartpicker.com/trends/price/memory/  \n[5] https://josephg.com/blog/electron-is-flash-for-the-desktop/",

      "abstract": "该讨论围绕电影专业学生难以完整观看电影的现象展开。核心争议在于这是否源于注意力下降，还是传统电影形式已不适应新一代的媒介习惯。有人认为短视频等新媒体导致注意力缩短，使学生难以适应节奏较慢的老电影；也有用户指出，许多电影课程指定的实验性作品本身枯燥难懂，与主流电影差异较大，容易引发倦怠。讨论中提到，年轻一代在信息密集的多媒体环境中成长，其认知模式可能更适应快节奏内容，但这不意味着智力下降。部分观点认为，电影学生本应通过专业分析深入欣赏影片，但若仅以娱乐心态观看，确实容易对叙事缓慢的老电影失去耐心。此外，有用户质疑选择电影专业却缺乏兴趣的动机，另有人指出现代优质影片众多，观众对平庸作品的容忍度降低。整体来看，社区普遍认同媒介环境变化影响了观影习惯，但对问题的根源存在不同解读。",

A friend of mine has a terrible Instagram addiction, yet has developed for himself a certain degree of cinephilia lately -- we've watched long movies together in theaters and not once has he been on his phone during the screenings. When one has faith that sustained attention might hold more value than that gained by interruption, they tend to prioritize the former.But the article points out that the students here don't even watch movies themselves -- \"students have struggled to name any film\" they recently watched. Why are these people even studying film? The inattention is clearly caused by disinterest.The phenomenon observed here must be caused by a combination of the general loss of discipline (which is the fallback attentive mechanism when interest is absent) and students' disinterest in the field they chose to study. The former has been well known; the latter is worth considering more.",

Films across the generations are very different in terms of how they lay out a narrative. Watch any film before 1980 and you'll start to see a pattern that the pacing and evolution of the narrative is generally very, very slow.Art is highly contextualized by the period it's created in. I don't really think it's fair to expect people to appreciate art when it's taken completely out of its context.Lawrence of Arabia, for example. What a brilliant, brilliant film. Beautiful, influential, impressively produced. And really, really boring and slow a lot of the time.If I were a film professor today, hell even 20 years ago, I would not expect a modern film student to sit through that whole thing. I think it's my job as a professor to understand the context of the period, highlight the influential/important scenes, and get students to focus on those instead of having to watch 4 hours of slowly paced film making and possibly miss the important stuff.",

Many of the movies you study in film school are genuinely excruciatingly slow and boring, unless you're hyper-motivated. Before mobile phones, you didn't have any choice but to sit through it. Now you have a choice. I suspect that film students 30 years ago, despite having a \"full attention span\", would also have been entertaining themselves on phones if they'd had them.I love movies. But I also make liberal use of 2x speed and +5s during interminably long suspense sequences that are literally just someone walking through a dark environment while spooky music plays.

If you disagree with a director's vision for a movie you can bring your own perspective, there's no right or wrong way to watch a movie. It's no different to picking out a specific track in an album, or finding a hook you really enjoy from a specific track and playing it on repeat.One of the most recent movies I watched and really enjoyed was Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse. It was an animation masterpiece, but I still skipped forward in a couple scenes because I don't care about the characters. Some of the animation sequences were interesting enough to merit slowing down to 1x and even going back to rewatch and analyze them in-depth though.Sometimes I'll encounter a seasonal anime that's quite terrible among multiple dimensions but which has few interesting aspects like creative art design or a couple interesting sequences, so I skim through it to look for those details in order to take them in. It's possible to appreciate various components of a work without caring for the combined result.One of the things which helped break me out of the normative movie-watching perspective was encountering this art project where a social media page would post every Spongebob frame in order [0]. It made me really start paying attention to a ton of minor details that I hadn't noticed previously, increasing my appreciation for the work that went into making it happen.In the past you really had no choice but to submit to the director's vision of a work, and you were forced to experience it the same as everyone else in the theater. Now we have more control than ever to enjoy works however we want. Game modding is another variation on this same principle: if I think a game has some bullshit mechanics, I should be able to patch it and play it however I want.[0] https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/sites/every-spongebob-frame-i...",

It's not that I suffer from a short attention spanNo, I'm sorry, I do think this is an attention span issue. You say there's no virtue in suffering through boredom, but a few minutes of scene-setting should not feel painful.Yes, some movies are boring, but those are bad movies. Turn them off. Good movies are made by skilled directors who know better than to stick a big boring part in the middle. Taste is subjective, of course, but the middle & the end get made by the same person. If the middle isn't enjoyable, the end probably won't be either; by the same token, if you consistently need to skip through the middle parts of movies with great endings, you're probably skipping good stuff which you might enjoy if you had a greater tolerance for slower, more atmospheric cinema. It might seem like sitting through the slow parts of a movie would make the experience of watching it worse, but I've found that resisting my urge to pull out my phone during slow bits has made me enjoy movies more.Habitually, I spend a lot of time with headphones on, listening to podcasts and videos and such. I find that if I do too much of this, though, it starts to get me down. Often the best thing for my mood is to take off my headphones and just sit with my thoughts for a while.

A really rough ide that has a hard time at scale, choking on package refreshes, many targets, and more. It has a special entitlement so you can't even binary patch it if you want to fix it!- Build systems. Cargo is _much_ easier to work with than SPM.- Macros support, codegen is still largely done outside of the macro system, which should indicate its use.- Linter / format support. Yeah, it exists, last I checked it's just a good bit worse.- Performance. There are MANY performance cliffs in Swift; most can be fixed by a sufficiently determined compiler developer, but at this point we've kinda departed talking about the language as-is.- Type inference time. Swift's bidirectional type inference causes a ton of choking on complex expressions, which is a real problem with its number one use case, SwiftUI.- An exacerbating factor on the above, imports are all implicitly module-scoped, meaning that changing a single file means recomputing the types for all files in the module. And because SPM and Xcode have such a rough time with multiple targets, that usually means that a single change can lead to recompiling all Swift files.- Weirdness around classes and structs? I understand that they had to do it for objc compatibility, but I would've found it much cleaner if they'd just from the start had something replacing class, like a fully-sugared `final class Box<T>` that replaces all uses of class.I agree that for the most part it _could_ be an easier rust, but between including bidirectional type inference without a cut operator and poor tooling I struggle to find where it's actually easier in cases that you can't just use typescript and dodge all the non-typecheck compilation headaches entirely.",

The ecosystem is tiny, and there’s nothing you gain from using it instead of Go or Rust for infra / distsys.Also, it works okay at best with VS Code, and you couldn’t pay me to use Xcode.Kotlin tried doing similar things to gain adoption on the server side. But server-side programming is a crowded space, and people just don’t like writing distsys code in another JVM language. Swift’s story is a little better on that front.If you want a quick-and-dirty language, Python and TypeScript do the job. For perf-sensitive, highly concurrent environments, Go is hard to compete against. A lot of ops tooling and infra code is written in Go. For systems programming and embedded code, Rust is a better choice.So while it’s fun to think about what language X gives you in terms of syntax, in practice it’s rarely enough to pick a language like Swift for your next non-toy backend distsys work.Also, Apple. Given their stance against free and open source software, I wouldn't be too thrilled to pick a language that works better in their walled garden.",

'F'.to_digit(16).unwrap() // is the 32-bit unsigned integer constant 15\n\nOr maybe an even closer to the metal example: Rust's pointer provenance APIs get to provide a method on raw pointers which takes a closure to do stuff like hide boolean flag bits at the bottom of an aligned pointer.

GENERATING code is now cheap (while the LLMs are subsidized by endless VC dollars, anyway), but the cost of owning that code is not.

That there is a pragmatic middle path, where people who have the experience, expertise, competence, and the ability to articulate can use these tools to get the outcomes they desire with the right sets of trade-offs.LLMs are tools. They are not gods to replace man, nor are they exclusively means of harm. It is entirely possible to denounce the blatant attempt of rent extraction in the form of OpenAI, Google Gemini, Microsoft CoPilot, Anthropic, and others, while still running Qwen and Ministral and their like on local hardware. You can, in fact, have it “both ways”.As fun as it is to poke at cloud services to see their new features and advancements, I (in IT terms) personally could never recommend them in any serious enterprise context for the very reason that they’re fundamentally insecure; you will never, ever have full E2EE with these services because it would nullify their ability to evolve, improve, monetize, and exploit.That said? I can truly be a one dinosaur army in an enterprise now, as a generalist with a modest Mac Mini (or Studio) and a local LLM to fill in edge cases as needed. I can query these local tools for questions on database schemas or build a one-off API integration for me, so I can focus on the substance of work in safeguarding and accelerating the enterprise. I don’t need fleets of specialists unless I’m running a huge conglomerate or have specific needs - and even then, it’s going to be cheaper to retain one or two seniors to direct the larger army of generalists when needed. The landscape has changed, and it’s why I target leadership and management roles accordingly with my sales pitch (“One senior generalist can do the work of three mid-level specialists”).Don’t get me wrong, I still have immense grievances regarding theft of work, reductions in force, rent extraction, and the seeming attempt at destroying local general compute, but local LLMs as a tool have been in my kit for years, and that’s not going away.",

They meant all the rest are architectural decisions & just everything surrounding the code. Quite frankly, the idea behind Ai/LLM's is to automate that too and convert it into pure text and I feel like the average layman significantly overestimates what AI can and cannot do.So the whole notion of show me the talk atleast in a more non engineering background as more people try might be net negative not really understanding the tech as is and quite frankly even engineers are having a hard time catching up with all which is happening.I do feel like that the AI industry just has too many words floating right now. To be honest, I don't want to talk right now, let me use the tool and see how it goes and have a moment of silence. The whole industry is moving faster than the days till average js framework days.To have a catchy end to my comment: There is just too much talk nowadays.

      "content": "Hey HN, we're Haakam, Michael, and Adi. We're building AgentMail (https://agentmail.to), the email inbox API for agents. We’re not talking about AI for your email, this is email for your AI.Email is an optimal interface for long-running agents. It’s multithreaded and asynchronous with full support for rich text and files. It’s a universal protocol with identity and authentication built in. Moreover, a lot of workflow critical context already lives in email.We wanted to build email agents that you can forward your work to and get back a completed task. The agents could act entirely autonomously as you wouldn't need to delegate your identity. If they did get stuck they could just send you, or anyone else, an email.Using Gmail, we kept getting stuck on the limitations of their API. No way to create inboxes programmatically. Rate and sending limits. OAuth for every single inbox. Keyword search that doesn't understand context. Per-seat pricing that doesn't work for agents.So we built what we wished existed: an email provider for developers. APIs for creating inboxes and configuring domains. Email parsing and threading. Text extraction from attachments. Realtime webhooks and websockets. Semantic search across inboxes. Usage-based pricing that works for agents.Developers, startups, and enterprises are already deploying email agents with AgentMail. Agents that convert conversations and documents into structured data. Agents that source quotes, negotiate prices, and get the best deals. Agents that emulate internet users for training models on end-to-end tasks.Here's demo of Clawdbots communicating using AgentMail: https://youtu.be/Y0MfUWS3LKQYou can get started with AgentMail for free at https://agentmail.toLooking forward to hearing your thoughts and feedback.",

      "abstract": "该HackerNews帖子讨论了YC孵化的创业项目AgentMail，这是一个为AI智能体提供专属邮箱收件箱的API服务。核心话题围绕电子邮件作为AI智能体交互协议的可行性与应用前景展开。\n\n社区反应总体积极，许多用户认可其潜力。有人认为电子邮件作为异步、支持富文本的通用协议，非常适合长期运行的智能体，并指出自动化处理2FA等场景价值显著。也有用户指出，现有方案如AWS SES或自行搭建（例如通过Cloudflare）可能实现类似功能，对产品的技术壁垒和定价模式提出质疑。讨论中提到，智能体邮箱地址可能面临提示注入攻击的安全风险，需要进一步防范措施。此外，有用户反馈官网存在前端错误，建议优化静态页面稳定性。\n\n在定价方面，有建议认为若增加每方案邮箱数量并降低单邮箱发送限制，会更适合拥有大量低频发送智能体的用户。尽管存在技术可行性和安全性的分歧，但普遍共识是电子邮件作为智能体通信接口具有广泛的应用场景，该项目在简化集成流程上提供了明确价值。",

Doctors do not like to tell you the good and the bad candidly - it's always \"we'll see what the next test says but things look positive\" and \"it could be as soon as 1 week or as long as several months depending on what we find\" when they know full well you're in there for 2 months at minimum you're a miracle case.

In an insane world, it was the sanest choice.The AI doctor will always have enough time for you, and always be at the top of their game with you.

In fact, I would say that ChatGPT is better than most doctors because most doctors don't actually listen to you. ChatGPT took the time to ask me questions and based on my answers, narrowed down a particularly scary diagnosis and gave excellent instructions on how to get to a local hospital in a foreign country, what to ask for, and that I didn't have to worry very much because it sounded very typical for what I had. The level of reassurance that I was doing everything right actually made me feel less scared, because it was a pretty serious problem. Everything it told me was 100% correct and it guided me perfectly.I was taking one high blood pressure medication but then noticed my blood sugar jumped. I did some research with ChatGPT and it found a paper that did indicate that it could raise blood sugar levels and gave me a recommendation for an alternative  I asked my doctor about it and she said I was wrong, but I gently pushed her to switch and gave the recommended medication. She obliged, which is why I have kept her for almost 30 years now, and lo and behold, my blood sugar did drop.Most people have a hard time pushing back against doctors and doctors mostly work with blinders on and don't listen. ChatGPT gives you the ability to keep asking questions without thinking you are bothering them.I think ChatGPT is a great advance in terms of medical help in my opinion and I recommend it to everyone. Yes, it might make mistakes and I caution everyone to be careful and don't trust it 100%, but I say that about human doctors as well.",

It even pointed out the no swelling could be due to a very small tear etc. It gave me a 90% chance of surgery too.I followed up by asking what test would definitely prove it one way or the other and it mentioned getting an X-Ray.We go off to the urgent care, son is already kind of hobbling around. Doctor says he seems fine, I push for an X-Ray and turns out no issue: he probably just pulled something. He was fully healed in 2-3 days.As someone who has done a lot of differential diagnosing/troubleshooting of big systems (FinTech SRE) I find it interesting that it was basically correct in what could have happened but couldn't go the \"final mile\" to establish it correctly.

The only obstacle is regulations, insurance and not being able to sue a LLM. But it is not a technical issue anymore. Doctors would only be necessary to perform more complicated procedures such as surgery, and that’s until we can fully automate it with robots. Most of the complicated medical issues I have had, some related to the immune system, were solved by myself by seeing them as engineering problems, by debugging my own body. Meanwhile doctors seeing me had no clue. And this was before having the tools we have today. It’s like doctors often cannot think beyond the box and focus only in treating symptoms.

Essentially I plugged in all of the data I could from my own observations of my issue over a 35 year period. It settled on these 3 possibilities: \"Functional Dyspepsia with slow gastric accommodation, Mild delayed gastric emptying (even subclinical), Visceral hypersensitivity (your nerves fire pain signals when stretched)\" and suggested a number of strategies to help with this. I implemented many of them and my stomach pain has been non-existent for months now... longer than I have ever been pain free.I feel like the difference is that doctors took what I told them and only partially listened. They never took it especially seriously and just went straight to standard tests and treatments (scopes, biopsies and various stomach acid impacting medications). ChatGPT took some of what I said and actually considered it, discounting some things and digging into others (I said that bitter beer helped... doctor laughed at that, ChatGPT said that the alcohol probably did not help but that the bittering agent might and it was correct).

But if it's bad where you are, yeah it's bad.You can see multiple doctors (among the ones you're allowed to see by your insurance). The doctors are all in an echo chamber which reinforces their thinking. Their cognitive load and goal seeking is burdened by what they can determine they can bill insurance for (there is still no price transparency). You don't have a \"regular\" / primary care physician because they rotate through the provider network constantly.Symptoms which don't fit the diagnosis are ignored / dealt with by deflecting that you should \"see your regular physician\". \"Stare decisis\" rules the second opinion. In their minds they believe they have no place to write down e.g. drug interactions with things which they didn't prescribe and don't believe in (the one time I got a call from quality control working for the umbrella organization I utilized this as an example of why I was looking for a different doctor and the QA person, who was, they said, a licensed nurse, said \"they can add that to the record, I'll do it right now\").You might get fired as a patient for passing out or having a seizure during a blood draw, hard to say whether that's because they failed to follow SOP and call the meatwagon or because you upset staff by acting unusually. You might get into a conversation with a physician which goes strange and they end up telling you that their clinic gets health inspections like a restaurant... they don't. There's a \"wet work\" inspection (just like a butcher shop) before occupancy is allowed, but there's no posted inspection report because... there is no inspection! But there's more. There are relatively \"safe\" and common procedures which still have ooopsies and people end up in the hospital or die. The hospitalization rate might be 1:5000 and the death rate 1:100000 but if you do a million of these there are going to be a few. If the procedure took place in a clinic it's supposed to be reported, and the reports are public record; but surprise surprise, the reported rates for serious complications are far far below what the actuarial tables show.If you're seeing constellations of incidents similar to these, you need to get a second opinion from somewhere / somebody who is not caught up in that particular bubble.

I want it to tell me what I actually said.Your architecture also doesn't tell you what you actually said. It just maps what you said to the likeliest of the 1254 syllables that you allow. For example, it couldn't tell you that you said \"wi\" or \"wr\" instead of \"wo\", because those syllables don't exist in your setup.",

Adult language learners usually have brains that have become resistant to, but not incapable of, changing the parts of the brain responsible for phoneme recognition. The neuroplasticity is still there but it needs some nudging with focused exercises that make it clear to your brain exactly what the problem is. Minimal pair recognition drills, for example, are a great place to start.It’s not the most fun task, but it’s worth it. You will tighten the pronunciation practice feedback loop much more than is possible with external feedback, so a better accent is the most obvious benefit. But beyond that, it will make a night and day difference for your listening comprehension. And that will get you access to more interesting learning materials sooner. Which hopefully increases your enjoyment and hence your time on task. Plus, more accurate and automatic phoneme recognition leaves more neurological resources free for processing other aspects of your input materials. So it may even help speed things like vocabulary and grammar acquisition.",

I can guarantee tones are not particularly useful and you can communicate with native speakers with all the tones messed up and that’s perfectly fine.

Listened back to make sure I said everything, the phonemes are there in the recording, but the UI displays the wrong phonemes and tones.By contrast, if I speak slowly and really push each tone, the phonemes and tones all register correctly.Also, is this taking into account tone transformation? Example, third tones (bottom out tone) tend to smoosh into a second tone (rising) when multiple third tones are spoken in a row.

Optional step 4. Re-record and replay until it’s close enough.There was no grading, no teacher checking recordings, no right or wrong; just hundreds of random sentences and a simple app to layer them.

I'm a native Mandarin speaker.> I can guarantee that tones are not particularly useful and that you can communicate with native speakers with all the tones messed up, and that's perfectly fine.Not at all. Tones are extremely important. If you have all the tones messed up, you can hardly communicate in Mandarin. It's true, as you said, that different regions of China have different dialects, and you'll find that people can communicate normally because: 1) The tonal differences in nearby regions are not too significant, and people can still try to understand based on context. And 2) In many cases, people switch to regular Mandarin when their dialects cannot communicate with each other. This is why Mandarin exists. It is an officially regulated dialect that all Chinese people learn, to solve the dialect problem among different regions. Chinese people may speak their own dialects at hometown, but when two Chinese people meet and find that their dialects cannot communicate, they immediately switch to Mandarin. Therefore, the tones in Mandarin are very important. To a considerable extent, Mandarin exists because of tones. You cannot communicate in it with messed up tones.",

Even worse, different English dialects randomly shift vowels (maybe like how Mandarin dialects use different tones). Neither my ear nor my mouth is tuned. From Wikipedia \"English phonology\":> The number of vowels is subject to greater variation; in the system presented on this page there are 20–25 vowel phonemes in Received Pronunciation, 14–16 in General American and 19–21 in Australian English.Native English speakers, if they are not teachers, tend to underestimate the challenge. I see YouTube videos that the western Chinese learner hypothesizes Spanish is most difficult for Chinese to learn because of the RR consonant -- I learned Spanish casually for a few years and I disagree. RR is difficult to pronounce, but I can clearly hear it and I won't confuse it with a different sound. In contrast to English, Spanish vowels are so easy.",

(hover over 3 dots of character and click the button with the 字 and scissors to see decomposition) says:    服 = 月 + 𠬝\n    𠬝 = 卩 + 又\n\nIf you go further, wouldn't you also have to decompose \"二\" into \"一\" and \"一\"?A Chinese teacher told me there are various approaches for decomposition, so this might not be a science or that rigorous, but I think consistency would then dictate, that you decompose \"二\" as well. I don't always agree fully with their decomposition either and usually I stop at any component, that still has meaning by itself, which can be pretty low level 1 or 2 strokes components already. For determining that, I also use information from a language school, which I copied into a repo: https://codeberg.org/ZelphirKaltstahl/language-learning/src/... \"All radicals from their website\". Also useful for memorizing the characters, if one can derive a mnemonic for a character from its components and their meaning.The advanced UI looks very complex, but I don't mind that. In fact it is quite cool! Just has some stuff I don't even know what it is about. I noticed, that once one toggles the advanced UI, I didn't find a way to toggle it back to simple again.Bookmarked!",

I applaud anyone who makes tools like this to try to make the process easier.My experience in learning Japanese pitch accent was eye-opening.  At the start, I couldn't hear any difference. On quizzes I essentially scored the same as random guessing.The first thing that helped me a lot was noticing how there were things in my native language (English) that used pitch information. For example, \"uh-oh\" has a high-low pitch. If you say it wrong it sounds very strange.  \"Uh-huh\" to show understanding goes low-high. Again, if you reverse it it sounds unusual.The next part was just doing lots of practice with minimal pairs.  Each time I would listen and try my best to work out where the pitch changed. This took quite a lot of time. I feel like massed practice (many hours in a day) helped me more than trying to do 10 minutes regularly.  Try to hear them correctly, but don't try too hard. I didn't have any luck with trying harder to 'understand' what was going on. I liken it to trying to learn to see a new color.  There isn't much conscious thought.The final piece of the puzzle was learning phrases, not individual words, that had pitch changes. For example: \"yudetamago\" could be boiled egg or boiled grandchildren.  Somehow my brain just had a much easier time latching on to multi-word phrases instead of single words.  Listening to kaki (persimmon) vs kaki (oyster) again and again seemed much harder.Of course, your mileage may vary with these techniques. I already spoke decent Japanese when I started doing this.",

It should not be a struggle, it's one of those the more you struggle and overintellectualize the less time you are focusing on paying attention and letting your hearing ability do its work it was evolved to do.The other thing is this whole emphasis on accents is misdirected. Teachers do not place this excessive emphasis on accents, it is people who want to sound \"authentic\" which is not a very wise goal of language learning in the first place.I do think that learning music can help a little, especially a sonically complex instrument like violin and the like.(caveat: I'm way oversimplifying on my Saturday afternoon, but that's my tentative views on this that I would try to argue for.)",

The design of the ring and its innumerable detectors and subsystems takes decades. So a great many people want the next collider to be funded regardless of its potential for scientific discovery.The same discussion can happen re the ISS. Its primary purpose was not science. It existed to give shuttle a parking spot, to keep the US manned space program ticking along and to keep a thousand russian rocket people from going to work for rando countries. The ISS will soon end. Are we going to put up a new one? A place to park starliner and dragon? Or are we going to shut down low earth orbit spaceflight?

The modified toolchain implements code designed to prevent memory- and type-safety issues that are typically encountered in C programs. For example, it helps prevent most vulnerabilities in the\nfollowing classes:> • Buffer overflows, by ensuring that all pointers carry bounds information that’s verified\nwhen accessing memory> • Heap exploitation, by separating heap data from its metadata and accurately detecting error conditions such as double free errors> • Type confusion, by ensuring that all pointers carry runtime type information that’s verified during pointer cast operations> • Type confusion caused by use after free errors, by segregating all dynamic memory allocations by static type",

The backups are even less effective than Apple's, although they say they will work on it.The developers also appear to believe that the apps have a right to inspect the trustworthiness of the user's device, by offering to support apps that would trust their keys [1], locking out users who maintain their freedom by building their own forks.It's disheartening that a lot of security-minded people seem to be fixated on the \"AOSP security model\", without realizing or ignoring the fact that a lot of that security is aimed at protecting the apps from the users, not the other way around. App sandboxing is great, but I should still be able to see the app data, even if via an inconvenient method such as the adb shell.1. https://grapheneos.org/articles/attestation-compatibility-gu...",

          "content": "That analogy misses the asymmetry in claims and power.Microsoft does not sell Windows as a sealed, uncompromisable appliance. It assumes a hostile environment, acknowledges malware exists, and provides users and third parties with inspection, detection, and remediation tools. Compromise is part of the model.Apple’s model is the opposite. iOS is explicitly marketed as secure because it forbids inspection, sideloading, and user control. The promise is not “we reduce risk”, it’s “this class of risk is structurally eliminated”. That makes omissions meaningful.So when a document titled Apple Platform Security avoids acknowledging Pegasus-class attacks at all, it isn’t comparable to Microsoft not listing every Windows virus. These are not hypothetical threats. They are documented, deployed, and explicitly designed to bypass the very mechanisms Apple presents as definitive.If Apple believes this class of attack is no longer viable, that’s worth stating. If it remains viable, that also matters, because users have no independent way to assess compromise. A vague notification that Apple “suspects” something, with no tooling or verification path, is not equivalent to a transparent security model.The issue is not that Apple failed to enumerate exploits. It’s that the platform’s credibility rests on an absolute security narrative, while quietly excluding the one threat model that contradicts it. In other words Apple's model is good old security by obscurity.",

          "content": "About the same time the 500-mile email problem happened (mid 1990s), I had a difficult to understand issue with my office PC. Every morning, I'd come in, slide my hard drive sled in, and turn the computer on. We had 128 Kbps ISDN internet at the office and I had the same at home, but that was too slow to do much work. So I'd take the drive home so I could work at night, especially in the winter when the office was too cold at night.Suddenly one winter morning, the PC wouldn't boot. I had to run to a meeting. When I got back, I turned the PC off and on again and everything was fine. The next morning, the same thing happened. The third day, I didn't have a meeting. I turned it off and back on, still no boot. I'd gotten in late, so I just turned it off and took an early lunch. When I got back, it still wouldn't boot. But I had a meeting, so I ran to that, leaving the computer on. When I got back, it booted fine.The next morning, same thing. I decided to look inside, not having any idea what might cause such symptoms. As I took the shell off, a tiny mouse came out, jump off my desk, and ran across my lap before jumping on the floor and scurrying out of sight. From inside the computer came the smell of mouse urine. Apparently he'd been crawling in through the open drive bay to keep warm every night, and urinating while he was in there. Once the computer had been on for a while, the heat and airflow would dry it out enough to eliminate whatever electrical short was keeping it from booting. I went to the store and bought an empty drive sled to put in the drive bay whenever I took my drive out, and the problem never came back. I felt lucky that the liquid didn't cause permanent damage.",

You could check for that by playing that same video but not starting at the beginning and see if it's the same duration. Or jump to just before it dies and see if it plays through.If by \"downloaded\" you mean The High Seas, those who provision the high seas are often on the cutting edge of using codecs with every last feature turned on to make the videos smaller to squeeze every last bit out of the encodings that they can, which can make them unusually expensive to decode.

This is one of my favorite all time IT stories because the client was right, and the engineer was left almost going crazy.When I was a Junior I asked an honest question to the senior I was working with at the time, great dude, I basically asked him because everyone joked about the \"works on my machine\" crowd, so I said, so what the heck do I do if it only works on my machine? He said you have to figure out what's different. It sounds obvious or simple, but if you go with that mindset, when someone's stuck in the \"it works on my machine idk why\" sure enough I ask \"what is DIFFERENT from your machine and this one?\" and it almost always leads to the right answers. It triggers something in our brains. I usually follow up whats different with \"what was the last change?\" in the case of a production issue.",

Does gcc behave any differently with the \"d\" suffix not there?

One would hope they'd comment on the PR though if they did that).

Repeat this pattern of probe, assess, drop and add closer to the target.You accumulate all data in your orchestrator, so in theory you don't need to deliberately issue multiple probes each round (except for the first) to get statistical power.

          "content": "Great post and a great little tool. Some of my experience using these techniques in production:1. Trilateration mostly doesn't work with internet routing, unlike GPS. Other commenters have covered this in more detail. So the approach described here - to take the closest single measurement - is often the best you can do without prior data.  This means you need a crazy high distribution of nodes across cities to get useful data at scale. We run our own servers and also sponsor Globalping and use RIPE Atlas for some measurements (I work for a geo data provider), yet even with thousands of available probes, we can only accurately infer latency-based location for IPs very close to those probes.2. As such, latency/traceroute measurements are most useful for verifying existing location data. That means for the vast majority of IP space, we rely on having something to compare against.3. Traceroute hops are good; the caveat being that you're geolocating a router. RIPE IPmap already locates most public routers with good precision.4. Overall these techniques work quite well for infrastructure and server IP addresses but less so for eyeball networks.https://ping.sx is also a nice comparison tool",

Pandoc is a Haskell program that basically uses a document tree structure to convert between one type of document format and another... maybe in terms of programming languages you'd call that an AST, an Abstract Syntax Tree... so maybe there's some kind of simplified AST (or something like that) out there that works as the base tree for all functional and lisp-like programming language (yes, lisp/lisplikes sort of preserve its/their own tree; their own AST -- via their intrinsic data structure, and that would seem to be true about functional programming languages too... so what is the base tree/AST of all of these, that all languages in this family can \"map on to\" (for lack of better terminology), that could be used (with AI / LLM's) as an \"Intermediary Language\" or \"Intermediary Data Structure\" (choose your terminology) to allow easily converting between one and the other?Anyway, if we had that or something like that, then Nix configurations could (in theory) be easily converted to Guix, and vice-versa, automatically, as could any other Linux configured by a functional and/or lisplike language...That, and I found the article very interesting!I may have to try Guix in the future!",

The HiveMind took over.But with all its pros, the thing I hate by far the most in NixOS is .. nix. I think the language is ugly beyond comparison; only shell scripts are uglier. I instead opted for a less sophisticated solution in that ruby acts as the ultimate glue to whatever underlying operating system is used. What I would like is a NixOS variant that is simpler to use - and doesn't come with nix. Why can't I use ruby instead? Or simple config files? I am very used to simple yaml files; all my system description is stored in simple yaml files. Since +20 years. That approach works very well (ruby expands these to any target destination; for instance, I have aliases for e. g. bash, but these are stored in yaml files and from that ruby then generates any desired target format, such as also cmder on Windows and so forth).> In fact GNU forked Nix fairly early and made their own spin called Guix, whose big innovation is that, instead of using the unwieldy Nix-language, it uses Scheme.I am glad to not be the only one to dislike nix, but boy ... scheme? Aka Lisp? Seriously???Young people use lisp? I somehow doubt that.    (cons* (channel\n          (name 'nonguix)\n          (url \"https://gitlab.com/nonguix/nonguix\")\n\nErm, no thanks.Why would users know what cons* does, anyway? That's stupid.YAML files exist for a reason. Keep. Things. Simple. (I know, I know, many use YAML files in a complex manner with gazillion nested indentation. Well, they are using it in a wrong way, then they complain about how bad yaml is.)> Since the code is pretty much just Scheme and the different mechanisms available are fairly well documented (see caveat below), the barrier to entry is much lower than with Nix in my opinion.Can't evaluate this. To me it seems as if NixOS may have changed, but Nix was always a big barrier. I decided to not want to overcome it, since I did not want to be stuck with a horrible language I don't want to use.",

But I already adopted a similar scheme as GoboLinux did soon after I switched to Linux in 2005 (well 2004 but mostly 2005 as I was still a big noob in 2004 really).Nix already existed in 2003. Besides that Nix store directories are more ingenious than versioned application directories (or hashed directories), the hash in the output path is the hash of the normalized derivation used to build the output path (well, in most cases, let's keep it simple). Derivations work similarly (also using hashes). Moreover, since a derivation can contain other derivations as an input, the Nix store represents hash/Merkle trees.This makes it very powerful, because you can see which parts of the tree need to be rebuilt as a result of one derivation changing.But with all its pros, the thing I hate by far the most in NixOS is .. nix.I think it depends on your background. I did some Haskell at some point in my live and I like Nix. It is a very simple, clean, lazy, functional programming language.

What I would like is a NixOS variant that is simpler to use - and doesn't come with nix. Why can't I use ruby instead?Because what nixpkgs does is not easily expressible/doable in Ruby. First, the package set is one huge expression in the end. That might seem weird, but it allows for a lot of powerful things like overlays. However, for performance reasons this requires lazy evaluation. Also other powerful abstractions require lazy evaluations (e.g. because there are some infinite recursions in nixpkgs).Second, the Nix packaging model requires a purity (though this gap was only properly closed with flakes). You have to be able to rely on the fact that evaluating an expression evaluates to the same result. Otherwise a lot of things would break (like substitution from binary caches).Third, things like overlays rely on fixed points, which can be done easily in a lazy functional language.---Having used Nix for 8 years now, I have a long list of criticisms as well though :).",

Key idea is to have encrypted secrets in the store, decrypted at runtime using machine-specific credentials (host SSH keys are a typical option to repurpose, or you can set up something else). For local management you also encrypt to the “developer” keys (under the hood data is symmetrically encrypted with a random key and that key is encrypted to every key you have - machines and humans).Alternatively, you can set up a secrets service (like a password manager/vault) and source from that. Difference is where the secrets live (encrypted store or networked service, with all the consequences of every approach), commonality is that they’re fetched at runtime, before your programs start.I’m currently using deploy-rs, but if I’d redo my stuff (and the only reason I don’t is that I’m pretty much overwhelmed by life) I’d probably go with plain vanilla nixos-rebuild --target-host and skip any additional layers (that introduce extra complexity and fragility).Just a crude and somewhat haphazard summary but hope it helps.",

It's not a matter of conviction; it's simply about managing your data:- Transferable snapshots (zfs send) mean very low-cost backups and restores, and serious desktop users don't want to be down for half a day because a disk failed.- A pool means effective low-cost RAID, and anyone in 2026 who isn't looking for at least a mirror for their desktop either doesn't care about their data or lacks the expertise to understand its purpose.ZFS is the first real progress in storage since the 80s. It's the most natural choice for anyone who wants to manage their digital information. Unfortunately, many in the GNU/Linux world are stuck in another era and don't understand it. They are mostly developers whose data is on someone else's cloud, not on their own hardware. If they do personal backups, they do them halfway, without a proven restore strategy. They are average users, even if more skilled than average, who don't believe in disk failures or bit rot because they haven't experienced it personally, or if they have, they haven't stopped to think about the incident.If you want to try out services and keep your desktop clean, you need a small, backup-able volume that can be sent to other machines eg. a home server, to be discarded once testing is done. If you want to efficiently manage storage because when something breaks, you don't want to spend a day manually reinstalling the OS and copying files by hand, you'll want ZFS with appropriate snapshots, whether managed with ZnapZend or something else doesn't really matter.Unfortunately, those without operations experience don't care, don't understand. The possibility of their computer breaking isn't something they consider because in their experience it hasn't happened yet, or it's an exceptional event as exceptional that doesn't need automation. The idea of having an OS installed for 10 years, always clean, because every rebuild is a fresh-install and storage is managed complementarily, is alien to them. But the reality is that it's possible, and those who still understand operations really value it.Those who don't understand it will hardly choose Guix or NixOS; they are people who play with Docker, sticking to \"mainstream\" distros like Fedora, Ubuntu, Mint, Arch. Those who choose declarative distros truly want to configure their infrastructure in text, IaC built-in into the OS, and truly have resilience, so their infrastructure must be able to resurrect from its configuration plus backups quickly and with minimal effort, because when something goes wrong, I have other things to think about than playing with the FLOSS toy of the moment.",

      "abstract": "该HackerNews帖子围绕“CPython内部机制解析”展开讨论，核心话题是Python主流实现CPython的内部架构与开发资源。社区普遍对深入理解CPython内部原理表示兴趣，有用户推荐了《CPython Internals》书籍及相关官方文档作为学习资料。\n\n讨论中观点多元：有人认为CPython的代码库混合了现代与90年代风格的C代码，且开发工具能有效辅助理解架构；也有用户指出编写Python原生扩展时，需手动处理引用管理等底层细节较为繁琐，尤其在Python 3中仍存在挑战。关于CPython的命名，部分用户认为“CPython”的提法虽精确但可能造成混淆，更倾向直接使用“Python”指代该实现；另有用户强调明确区分CPython、PyPy等不同实现有其必要性。\n\n在性能方面，讨论中提到有用户对比Python与JavaScript V8的执行速度，并探讨了历史技术债务及NumPy等库直接访问数据的影响。社区共识在于肯定深入理解CPython内部机制的价值，同时分歧体现在对命名习惯的偏好及对底层开发复杂性的不同感受。",

It is very often used to provide a scripting API over lower level C libraries. To be ergonomic in this function, CPython (the major implementation) exposed some internal details of its execution model, which C libraries can reach into. This makes it very hard to make more aggressive optimizations, as one example a C library can just increase/decrease the reference count of an object. Another design decision (that got some discussion recently) is the GIL (global interpreter lock) that makes python much less competitive than something like Java. (JS also does a single thread of execution, though there are ways around it).JS has a different use case, so access to the C world doesn't impose such restrictions on it.",

At the very least, it provides references that you can read yourself.Of course, you can't really do all of that on a free plan.That's far from ideal, but if you are motivated and care about these technical details (which you probably do), you can get pretty good results.=====Putting all of this aside, you can sometimes find YouTube videos on obscure channels that talk about these things.

As it traveled down the valley it became a fireball, around five kilometers in diameter\"This doesn't even make any sense. A 1km asteroid going many kilometers a second entered at a six degree angle, tore through hundreds of miles of atmosphere without burning up or breaking up, hit a mountain causing a landslide and only then turned into a 5km fireball and traveled down the valley (at a height of ~1500 meters above the valley floor) and just sort of evaporated?I don't think physics works the way the author of this piece thinks physics works.",

The people of this time had donkey-pulled battle carts that were so slow they had to be abandoned if there was a retreat, but they were able to record and measure astronomical events this accurately.It's also mind-boggling to consider why they were making such observations.  It was all about omens that could determine the success of harvests or battles.  There is certainly some of what we might now consider scientific thought going on here.  They produced omen tables that exhaustively covered every combination of events they could think of, not yet realizing that some combinations were impossible (e.g. A Lunar eclipse at high noon).Omens sound silly today, but the fundamental motivation of early astronomers was to make sense of what was going on in the heavens in order to help make better decisions on the ground.  If everyone believed in these omens, they had real power and the predictions these astronomers made may have had large impacts.",
