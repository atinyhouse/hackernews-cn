      "abstract": "该讨论围绕Discord即将实施的身份验证新规展开，核心争议在于平台要求用户通过人脸扫描或上传身份证件以获取完整服务权限。多数用户对此表示强烈反对，认为此举严重侵犯隐私，尤其担忧敏感生物识别数据的安全风险。讨论中提到，有用户援引Discord过去的数据泄露事件，指出平台保护能力存疑；也有用户强调，此举可能威胁匿名用户、性少数群体及特定地区用户的安全。部分人认为，年龄验证应通过设备本地处理而非上传证件，以平衡保护未成年人与隐私的需求。整体上，社区普遍质疑Discord政策的透明性与必要性，并呼吁通过取消订阅等方式表达抗议。同时，有观点指出这反映了网络服务“过度验证”的趋势，可能迫使部分用户寻求替代平台。",

But I think this is a reasonable place for me to post some thoughts.Given current events in the USA, I can't emphasize enough how worried one should be about the fact that a few companies like Discord, Google (Gmail), and Meta have databases with access to the private conversations of hundreds of millions of people with their closest friends and family members, linked up with their identity.Some of the big strengths of running a self-hosted Zulip server for your community are:- Zulip servers are operationally simple, highly stable and easy to upgrade.- Zulip is much better than Discord or Slack for managing the firehose of busy communities. Or at least, a lot of people tell us that they prefer the user experience to everything else they've tried, after a few weeks of getting used to it. :)- Your community leaders get to make the policy decisions about data protection, identity, etc.- It's 100% FOSS software, with an extremely readable and maintainable codebase that ~1500 people have successfully contributed code to. I don't think you'll find modern alternatives with a comparable featureset to Discord that are more resilient to the sponsoring company being acquired or going out of business.- We are a values-focused organization (https://zulip.com/values/) where providing a public service is important to us all.- Each server is completely self-contained and independent, with the only centralized services needed from us being desktop/mobile app publication and mobile push notifications delivery (which is free for community use and soon to be E2EE).I'm happy to answer any questions.",

          "content": "> There was an appeal button; she was asked to take a picture of her face from many angles and upload ID. She gave them everything they asked for, but when Facebook reviewed the appeal, they closed her account permanently.I can't speak for every company, but I know with Facebook and Paypal, these requests generally are from automated systems and the chances of successfully reopening the account is well under 1%. The info you submit is not viewed by a human and the systems are mostly treated as a way to lighten the load on human support staff. They don't care if your account is reopened, they just want you to feel like you had a chance, did all you could, and then just give up.I discovered this about 20 years ago dealing with Paypal. I happened to know someone who worked in Paypal engineering at the time. I had a well established account, a Paypal debit card, linked accounts, etc., everything you could need to feel good about an account.Out of the blue it was suspended and I was sent into this system to send in verification documents. I gave everything it wanted. First it was ID, then a \"utility bill\" so I sent over my phone bill. That wasn't acceptable because it didn't prove I lived at my address for some reason, so I sent a natural gas bill. Even though that did have to be tied to a physical address (you can't deliver gas wirelessly!) I was asked for an electric bill. Then the lease. Then a bank statement. Every time I gave it pretty quickly. Then I was asked for a passport. I didn't have one. Suddenly that was the only thing that could unlock my account and as soon as they had the passport my account would be reopened. Nothing further would be done without a passport, not even communication.I asked my friend to look into it. She said, \"that's on purpose, that's the NoBot. It gets people out of support's hair.\" Turns out if you let unhappy customers complain to humans on the phone they will, so some exec decided to improve call center metrics by forcing customers into a system designed to keep them occupied until they gave up. You funneled people into it, and it would continue to reject their submissions with new reasons infinitely. It just went through a list of things to ask for, and when it found one you couldn't provide, suddenly that was the key and without it you were screwed.Companies still do this today.",

They are very inaccurate.Sometimes it works with the front camera on one smartphone but doesn’t with another (iPhone 17’s distortion), sometimes it recognizes your face on one day, but desperately fails to recognize you on another. I had to repeatedly record videos for it only to fail over and over again. Anything their system flags as suspicious, anything, will trigger the same video identification flow again, which effectively blocks your money in the account.I’m closing my accounts with a couple of banks with these video id flows. Simply because it’s way too easy to lose access to my money in the account with them. If their QA is not good enough for this vital requirement, I don’t want to know how they treat other requirements.

It also seems \"obvious\" that it's similarly unwise to give it to a bank. But you can do that to a random guy on AirBnB? A hotel? To a delivery service (Uber/Wolt/whatever)? Dicsord?

So if you want your self-hosted Zulip server to work with the Zulip client apps in the App Store and Play Store, you have to use Zulip's push server, and there's nothing Zulip can do to fix that.Matrix works analogously; if you use the Element app from the App Store or Play Store, then you're using Element's push notification server, even if your Matrix homeserver is self-hosted. It's possible that Element allows their server to be used gratis in situations where Zulip charges a fee, I don't know their policies or anything, but in principle Matrix still leaves you exactly as dependent on a third party's goodwill unless you make your friends install a privately distributed mobile app.Zulip IIUC does not restrict self-hosting of any feature that's technically possible to self-host.",

Organizations with a software budget should be happier to pay a fair price for ethical, user-first software from a friendly vendor than for a closed-source product from a megacorp. And Zulip's full-time development team should be able to make a living building ethical FOSS software.",

It started as me scratching my own itch, and now it’s turning into a real platform.Each game adds more building blocks to the editor: multiplayer, event systems, NPC behaviors, pathfinding, etc. I build a system once, and then anyone using the editor can use it in a click.\nFor game logic, I recently added a visual event system I’m really excited about. It’s kind of like Unreal Blueprints, but focused on 2D. You pick a trigger, wire conditions, and chain actions in a node graph [1].Big challenge right now: most people who want to make games needs assets, and don't know how to get/make them. So I’m building a marketplace where pixel artists can upload tilesets/characters, and unlike itch.io, assets are usable directly inside the engine. No ZIP downloads or import setup, just browse and drop into your game. A preview here[2].Also, if you want to use the editor but ship elsewhere, you can export terrain, animations, and hitboxes to Godot 4.

In the same week I was explaining another aspect and got the same response.  I think management has been overcomplicated by people trying to codify it. I think MBAs and systems like EOS try to dumb everyone down to inhuman lowest-common-denominator robots. That is the main cause of the productivity crisis.That's why people leave their jobs, and magically find they are 100% more productive without a boss. No BS, and they are inspired.I think you could get further faster by being a human, being inspiring, being a leader. I think you could learn more from Nelson than whatever nasty dehumanising theory most bosses have been reading.I'm struggling to find the motivation to write up my notes (neurodiversity both helping me see the problem and stopping me do anything about it).  I'm struggling to name  the theory. I am struggling ( with some limited success) in noticing what I do differently. I'm also struggling with recovering from a major burnout from succeeding creating highly motivated teams in really tough organisations.I thought all along that I would be better with a collaborator watching me and noting the differences between what I do and what everyone else is doing, then interviewing me about it.Maybe I could publish bits of it, little tidbits of blogs (who would find them?) or social media videos (I really don't want to have to record and edit videos).

I learn much better working with real code and this was a great experience. It was certainly a different experience than it would have been without an LLM teacher, reviewer, helper, assistant. The app was beautifully designed and very cleanly implemented back in Java 1.4 days of 2004 so it has been a joy to modernize it while attempting to preserve the clean design.  The OpenGL work and the necessary math was a lot different than what I have been doing for most of my career so it was a lot of fun. I will probably continue tinkering with Tribal Trouble occasionally as I still enjoy playing the game. I want to learn Blender to edit/improve the 3D models. (https://github.com/bondolo/tribaltrouble)For now I have mostly moved on from gaming and am instead working on improving the accessibility (#a11y) of the Wireshark network protocol capture/analysis tool. There are a lot of blind and low vision IT folks for whom this tool is a job requirement. The current accessibility is unfortunately poor. I've submitted my first PR and am relearning the Wireshark source after last contributing 20 years ago. It's also been 15 years since the last time I did anything with Qt so that has been a refresher as well. I don't enjoy working in C++ but the goal matters so I will suffer through. (https://wireshark.org)I plan to work on Wireshark for a couple of months at least and then look for something else to contribute to, probably also accessibility related. I have some ideas already about next apps. I'm currently tempted to build an NFC app for iOS in Swift but haven't decided yet. After having built in the last year both Kotlin Compose and TypeScript React apps, none of which I enjoyed very much, I am somewhat curious if Swift and SwiftUI will be more fun.",

The existing options are either libraries you embed in every service (Resilience4j, opossum, etc.) leaving every server stateful, or going full service mesh which is overkill for most teams.Openfuse gives you a central control plane for circuit breaker policies across your stack. You define your reliability rules in one place, get visibility into breaker states, and can react without redeploying anything.Been a great project and I'm genuinely happy with where it landed. If you're running microservices or an integration-heavy monolith and have ever cursed at a cascading failure, I'd love to hear how you're handling it today! :)",

It was too fun to stop so I kept going.  After a few days I was happily making beats in it, and since then it's only gotten better.It's live and totally free to use, and works in macos & Linux (Windows soon). I'm about to launch v1.0 now, just working with folks in the community to round out the Factory Kits a little more for users new to beatmaking.Turns out, making beats with no mouse and a terminal interface strikes the perfect balance of hardware feel and software power, and I'm loving the result.  Been sharing it with folks in my beatmaking sphere and have plans to continue expanding its reach through more collaborations, contests, and in-person events.Hope it brings you as much joy as it does to me :)",

I am wondering how might one apply a distributed systems approach without having music pirated and shotgunned all across the internet? Like how would you quickly match a person to all the available music metadata? How would you model for interest matching if the music library is spread out across multiple nodes.I would imagine a lot of people are ok with paying 5-10$ a month instead of 15-20$ for music they like from a set of artists they like.",

Knowing what makes a game actually fun is a skill Claude can't shortcut. You need to playtest, iterate, and develop taste.\n- Art and assets. This is the #1 blocker for most solo devs. Claude can't draw your sprites or design your tilesets.\n- Feel and polish. Tweaking jump curves, screen shake timing, hit feedback — that's all manual iteration. AI will give you \"technically correct\" values that feel lifeless.\n- Architecture decisions. Claude will happily generate an ECS system or a scene manager, but it doesn't know your game's actual needs. Bad architecture early on will cost you weeks later.Start with a tiny scope (like a single-screen platformer), use Claude Code to move fast on the code side, but spend most of your energy on the parts AI can't help with — design and feel.Also, shameless plug,  if you want to skip the code entirely and just focus on making the game, that's what CraftMyGame is for. Everything is visual, no coding needed. Might be a good way to prototype ideas fast before deciding if you want to go deeper on the code side ;)",

It is complicated,  but it is normally an incentives problem, most commonly status/ power rather than monetary. Often they have created blocking processes that the company sees as some sort of control or policing. It tends to be rather easy to change that if you are their boss. It is harder, but not impossible as a colleague. Often the application of cold hard rigorous logic,  an understanding of the real controls etc. Can unstick them.I work in a 100k person company at the moment (admittedly I'm not in charge of that many of them), so I understand the problem of scale, but I would counter that the changes neede are rather subtle. I think much can be achieved by focusing on the 20 people at the top. Culture cascades. For example if you dig in over a KPI not being achieved, when someone explains that it is counterproductive, or conflicts with another KPI,  how do you think they will manage their team in future?",

As the language is similar to python, hopefully it is able to work well syntactically. But of course, the correctness and accuracy of the circuit would be more challenging to get right. Your work at https://www.mikeayles.com/#tokn is very cool! This will be very useful when I try LLMs!I have seen both atopile and tscircuit too and they are really complete it terms of the entire PCB design flow compared to circuitscript, which is just focused on the schematic part.The ato language works well for specifying parts and parameters, but is very basic for defining connectivity. This means that the designer will have minimal control of how the final schematics will turn out. Of course, atopile focuses on the complete design flow, so having nice schematics could be a want rather than a need. For myself, especially in my professional job, clear and well-organized schematics are important not just for understanding and creation, but also troubleshooting the design and eventually improving the design.I did try some automatic layout features for the schematic that balances giving the user some control over the overall schematic, but this was really hard to get right. In the end, I went with the logo/turtle approach and give full layout control to the user.For tscircuit, I like typescript as a programming language and circuitscript itself is created in typescript. But typescript is really clunky to use for schematic design. Coupled with react, there is a lot of extra noise/symbols when looking at the code and for complex designs, it will be challenging to understand and troubleshoot. Moreover, I believe that typescript/javascript is less common among electronics engineers compared to python (which circuitscript is based on). The simplicity of python is one of the reasons it is popular and that is what I believe might help to lower the learning curve for circuitscript.",

Existing tools are solid but they feel outdated.Downloaded and onboarding was nice. A couple of things:- The initial schema for my local Postgres table was showing public but there were a bunch of tables showing that clearly were not tables in my public schema. Changing the schema to something else and back worked.- Limiting the free version on number of tabs feels... annoying. I appreciate that a lot of stuff out there doesn't even have a free version but the software automatically opened with a few tabs (or I accidentally clicked on it?) and then as soon as I clicked on my first table I was paywalled. I feel like I'll accidentally open more tabs (even though I really just wanna work on one at a time) and get frustrated, which is more likely to drive me away than to pay at this point.Note btw that ofc you have to make money and this is a product that I feel I'd be willing to pay for but I got frustrated within 2mins of using it so it wasn't like oh I've felt the value let me pay, it was more like I haven't even gotten to value yet.Great work anyway and I'll keep trying and provide feedback as it comes!

Happy to see someone executing it so well.For me, it started when I spent a year and a half reading and digesting books for and against young earth creationism, then eventually for Christianity itself (its historical truth claims). It struck me that the books were just a serialization of some knowledge structure that existed in the authors’ heads, and by reading I was trying to recreate that structure in my own head. And that’s a super inefficient way to go about this business. So there must be a shortcut, some more powerful intermediate representation than just text (text is too general and powerful, and you can’t compute over it… until now with LLMs?)That graph felt a lot like code to me: there’s no unique representation of knowledge in a graph, but there are some that are much more useful than others; building a well-factored graph takes time and taste; graphs are composable and reusable in a way that feels like it could help you discover layers of abstraction in your arguments.",

But it's simplicity cuts through the crap. No amount of baby cash, or white picket fences, or coercion, or lack of birth control, or whatever other set of schemes you can make, none of that matters. Only if the mothers in aggregate truly believe that their children will have good lives, then will they have them.That's a gigantic task, I know.

For people on the left, it means less consumption, less environment impact, less carbon footprint, and in general fewer damn evil people who are destroying the mother earth. For the right, everyone is responsible for their own destiny including their retirement life so they worry about their retirement spending solely on their own anyway. In practice, Japan seems to be fine. In particular their young people have so many job openings to fill.So, what exactly are we worrying about? The social security is not sustainable? The medical cost will go through the roof? There's no enough military power? There won't be enough consumption to support the growth (in that case, why do we have to keep growing? Why can't we just stay where we are? Again, not rhetorical questions but honestly curious about the answers)?",

It was bizarre to me that every person in the bus (about 12-15 people aged between 18-25 maybe) were buried in their phones. No one was talking to each other, not looking outside, nothing. I had the latest iPhone but since America was new for me I mostly spent time looking at the world around me and talking to people. I felt sad that the social world had come to this.Fast forward to now and this is what I see in India too. Talking to random people in their prime years (maybe 18-30) is now 'weird'. But it's perfectly fine if it's via 'insta' or 'snap'. I can't imagine how much worse it's now in America in that age group. I know my pre teen nephews have withdrawals if I take away their devices here in India.The moral here is that procreation requires better social skills and strong presence in the world and good parenting will probably create that. In order to raise an offspring, people need to have good mental health and that generally leads to good physical health which in turn improves the mental health and so on which can lead to procreation etc. The scrolling and virtual world is a distraction from reality. Something that keeps away humans from each other. We will only see this getting worse. In India the social world is still good enough to see higher birth rates. But that is also now slowing down. Mental health of people is not great. People complain about being single but there is virtually no way to hold a conversation as getting their attention is impossible. Phones are glued to their eyes and hands even when sitting with you.I am hoping though things will be different in the future.",

Soon it will be 1:2.We already allocate immense resources to the elderly (over 50% of US federal budget is for old people + national debt, where debt accrues for fungible reasons but the biggest explosion is money transfers/healthcare to the old). We have a few levers we can pull there - we don't have to give money transfers to the wealthiest members of what are, in fact, the wealthiest generation by taking from younger people. We could maybe means-test some of it. But they are politically hairy and come kind-of late. All that debt is essentially already borrowing from people who don't yet exist to pay off the old of today.So it would be somewhat nice to have more people in the future because we have already borrowed their money (or if you are 30, our money).That makes things difficult. Even if we did not set up the entire USG to do this, having more retirees than workers makes it hard economically. You could imagine a decade where every 4th person is working in a nursing home, basically.But other than the massive looming financial crisis and the care problem, yeah, its not so bad.",

Nothing. It's devastating for the people who I know who can't have children despite all of their attempts and even then tends to lead to adoption in many cases.All of the narratives, trend marketing and media capitalize on a story that people have been invested in pushing for decades that is at worst an outright lie and at best a half truth to accomplish some political goals.People need each other. Men need women. Women need men. Children need both parents. And we are all better for it. No matter how broke you think you are or how much you think it will cost, you will figure it out together.

I would have picked based on access to nature and cost, she made us pick based on where other families live and proximity to family. In my town everyone is either actively parenting kids or had raised kids already, so the residents (and businesses) are super accommodating of families with kids. To the point where if I have to take a little one to the bathroom in a restaurant, people often invite my big one (5 year old) to hang out at their table so I don't have to worry about it.Similar for social circle. Because everyone is my town is roughly dealing with the same things it's relatively easy to bond with new people. We've met people talking at the park, at t school drop off, while waiting at the martial arts place etc. Most people are nice if not super interesting but you meet enough people you like.And living close to family (my wife's family in this case) means you have more network around etc.Obviously it's not easy to just pick up and move but I am sharing this because the benefits of living in the right, family oriented, place would have been lost on me.

Financial mobility, career prospects/growth, hobbies, leisure, and retirement preparation are just a few of the things that have to take a back seat for both the mother and the father on top of all the things that impact both individually (especially the mother). At minimum, kids are like a boat anchor on all of those things. Naturally, for many people this can make starting a family look a lot putting an end to their personal lives until retirement.Some might say this is selfish, but on the other hand it’s kind of weird to expect anybody to commit to that for the sake of some other party, whether that be society, the government, peers, or parents, particularly when none of them are doing anything of substance to help mitigate those impacts in exchange.And that’s without even touching the financial security angle. It’s unpleasant to have to struggle and scrape by as an adult, but absolutely terrifying when there’s children involved, and for most couples the likelihood that they’ll need to struggle at some point is much higher if they have children. It’s understandable that people don’t want to risk that if they don’t absolutely have to.",

Turkey has a lower birthrate than the UK, and Mexico has a lower birthrate than the US. Places like North Africa and South India have seen declines in birthrates comparable to the West.He makes the argument that declining birthrates are due more to a fall in coupling than a fall in people in relationships choosing to have kids. He brings up that birthrates would actually be increasing if marriage rates remained constant. This means that all the incentives countries push such as subsidized childcare or tax breaks to have kids are putting the cart before the horse, as a growing share of young people don't have a partner to have kids with to begin with.He then brings up that the fall in coupling a country experiences is roughly correlated to the rate of mobile internet usage in that country. 46% of American teens say they use social media \"almost constantly\" vs. 24% a decade ago. People would rather use social media than go out and meet others.

          "content": "In my opinion, it's this, though I think it's a second-order effect. I believe that the issue isn't so much that women are working, but rather that there is a shortage of household labor. This labor pool is what was traditionally used for childcare needs. When you pair that labor shortage with (terrible) modern parenting standards, there just isn't enough time to raise kids without becoming a zombie.https://pbs.twimg.com/media/G-p2hvebQAEkEBg?format=jpg&name=...Edit: To be clear, I think there are multiple contributing factors. It's just that, in my view, the time/labor shortage is the core of the issue. Everything else feeds into it in some way. The factors eventually start stacking and problems that contribute to the time issue get exacerbated by their own contributing factors.Economics pressures, for instance. Bad housing economics means couples work maximum hours to afford daily expenses, decreasing available household labor. It also fractures extended family systems when people have to relocate for cheaper housing or better jobs, eliminating the traditional labor-pooling arrangements for childrearing. Generally poor median household economics keep parents in constant anxiety too, which then requires time to be spent on coping routines.Social atomization has further taken away the kind of pooled childcare labor that used to absorb overflow. Media has displaced churches, bars, parks, and bowling alleys with private screen time, shrinking social circles with scarce opportunities to rebuild them. Car-based infrastructure further reduces local community interaction and subtly dehumanizes neighbors into obstacles who steal parking and slow you down. Remote work and online shopping accelerate this deterioration. The result of all of this? Parents who already don't have extended family, also don't have friends, neighbors. or community to cover childcare needs. The sort of \"Hang out at the neighbor's house while I go to my book club meeting.\" scenario has largely gone extinct because of this.Even if a couple does better than the average bear in these areas, and they have options, ambient paranoia bottlenecks their outsourcing of childcare anyway. Our media environment has normalized constant fear. Fear that every blade of grass conceals a potential predator, so every adult is regarded as a serious risk to your kid(s). This compounds further because it's gotten to the point where children (and teenagers) can't play outside or otherwise exist independently without supervision. This increases the time parents must spend on daily childcare needs. So not only can they not decrease the time spent, but they now have to spend even more because of it.On top of all of this, the fraying social fabric creates an effect similar to cellular breakdown. Where those who become disconnected from the larger biological system stop acting for the collective benefit and further prioritize the self, becoming cancerous. This leads to growing numbers of extremist, anti-social individuals with poor mental health. Individuals who both compound the scarcity and isolation of parents, and justify their media-sourced fear of other adults. This is an example of the contributing factors to the contributing factors.You get the idea.",

I think the real reason why we don't see aliens is that once the population reaches certain level of intelligence and awareness, it takes only one generation thinking \"this is not worth it\" to cause dramatic population collapse which might wipe out entire species. And the thing is, \"life isn't worth it\" might actually be true, as much as evolution does everything to convince us otherwise.But now that I think of it, there might be solutions. The problem is, they're incompatible with individualism. Imagine passing a law that everyone is obliged to take care of a child. Sure, this would cause issues, but would instantly solve the population crisis. The problem is, such a law will never be passed in a democratic society, because everyone votes according to what they believe is their own best interest, not the best interest of the group. But an absolute regime could potentially do this.Now that I think of it, maybe the problem is that human societies grew too big too fast and our brains didn't adapt.

Myth: People are too selfish/liberal to have kids.Reality: It’s not about hedonism. Instead, people are avoiding parenthood because the life has become such a grind. In places like Korea, young people feel that bringing a child into such a hyper-competitive, expensive world is unfair to the child.2. Myth: It’s a biological problem (low testosterone/chemicals).Reality: There is no evidence that people can’t have kids physically. The issue is a lack of desire. It is a social and economic choice, not a medical one.3. Myth: Women working is the cause.Reality: Data show birth rates are actually higher in countries where women have more jobs and support.

Myth: Immigrants will replace the population.Reality: Newcomers quickly adopt the habits of their new country. Within one generation, immigrant birth rates drop to match everyone else’s.5.

They met up with a 5th friend before they crossed the street.Then I walked - well, more like ran - with the 5 of them down the 111 steps that take us from the street level to the schoolyard.  When they reached the bottom, they met up with 3 more friends who had just been let out of the drop-off zone in front of the school itself.  Said a quick goodbye to my kid, but he wasn't really paying attention, he was already ensconced in his pack of 8.I've gotten there with my kid before drop-off time, walked down the stairs with him, and there's been a pack of about 20-30 kids and 2-3 parents usually milling around before the school gates open.I realize that this is somewhat atypical in 21st-century America, and we specifically chose this community because, well, it actually has a sense of community, but it's not unique.

This has to be done comprehensively to work: if, say, you provide free daycare but it runs 8-4, a professional parent probably isn’t going to change their estimate of the costs of having a child much at all since it’s still disruptive in ways which likely affect their long-term career trajectory. The richer the country, the more that matters: higher income is paired with higher cost of living and more opportunities which will be harder to take advantage of as a parent.",

And it's not very practical or convenient to do that when you're in a store and want to pay, in contrast to swiping your credit card.So while I see very convenient gaining some sovereignty from American companies for these payments, I think we're losing it when we will need devices controlled by other American companies in order to use the new system.",

There is a premium for that flexibility that gets reflected in processing fees.- For both consumers and merchants, fraud risk is real and while it's the most solvable part of all this it's a real (and costly!) factor today. That risk for fraud gets moved upstream to the networks/acquirers/processors/issuers and that premium shows up in (you guessed it) processing fees.If you want to switch the world to a debit-based system where economic transactions are limited by cash on hand, I'd argue that's a poorer and less dynamic world than the one we're operating in today.",

Sure they have your banks local branding but it's Visa anyway.This also applies to payment terminal, most (not all) go through the Visa payment network to process payments.And even in the same country a lot of online payment either goes through credit cards (again mostly Visa in EU) or PayPal. This isn't technically needed at all but due to fragmentation whatever alternative you want to use is just sometimes available.Which is where Wero comes in:- try to reduce fragmentation by making it a cooperation across many banks (of which most had their own failed PayPal alternative)- onboard people on (local) online banking and private Phone2Phone payment (e.g. bill sharing)- then (now) expand to pushing some payment terminal providers to support it with Phone based payment. There are multiple initiatives for it.The later part is possible due to 3 reasons:- payment apps on phone bypassing secure module monopoly nonsense related to EC/Credit cards and visa- a lot of the in-person checkout systems of small businesses are now a tablet + separate cash register + EC terminal. This means that even if the EC terminal doesn't support Wero the payment system can still do so through their tablet.- Also I think some of the wider used payment terminal in large EU specific chains can get Wero support with a software update.Still it's by far not a perfect situation:- still too much fragmentation/to little adoption by banks- \"old\" payment terminals and (physical) checkout systems which are bound to Visa and can't easily be updatedSo there most likely won't be a hard break anytime soon, and your EC card will likely continue using Visa secure module and network for a very very long time.But having a technical working alternative which can slowly start eating market share is already a huge step forward.",

Although I wrote and published games for the Macintosh for a number of years as I finished up college, my professional career (in the traditional sense) began when I was hired by Apple in 1995 and relocated to the Bay Area.Yeah, what started out as a great just got worse and worse as time went on.I suspect though that to a large degree this reflects both the growing complexity of the OS over that time as well as the importance of software in general as it became more critical to people's lives.Already, even in 1984 when it was first introduced, the Mac had a rich graphics library you would not want to have to implement yourself. (Although famously of course a few apps like Photoshop nonetheless did just that—leaning on the Mac simply for a final call to CopyBits() to display pixels from Adobe's buffer to the screen.)You kind of have to accept abstraction when networking, multiple cores, multiple processes become integral to the machine. I guess I always understood that and did not feel too put out by it. If anything a good framework was somewhat of a relief—someone else's problem, ha ha. (And truly a beautiful API is just that: a beautiful thing. I enjoy working well constructed frameworks.)But the latter issue, the increasing dominance of software on our lives is what I think contributed more to poisoning the well. Letting the inmates run the asylum more or less describes the way engineering worked when I began at Apple in 1995. We loved it that way. (Say what you want about that kind of bottom-up culture of that era, but our \"users\" were generally nerds just like us—we knew, or thought we knew anyway, better than marketing what the customer wanted and we pursued it.)Agile development, unit tests, code reviews… all these weird things began to creep in and get in the way of coding. Worse, they felt like busywork meant simply to give management a sense of control… or some metric for progress.\"What is our code coverage for unit test?\" a manager might ask. \"90%,\" comes the reply from engineering. \"I want to see 95% coverage by next month,\" comes the marching orders. Whatever.I confess I am happy to have now left that arena behind. I still code in my retirement but it's back to those cowboy-programmer days around this house.Yee haw!",

If you were a smart dev before AI, chances are you will remain a smart dev with AI.My experience so far is that to a first approximation, the quality of the code/software generated with AI corresponds to the quality of the developer using the AI tool surprisingly well. An inexperienced, bad dev will still generate a sub-par result while a great dev can produce great results.The choices involved in using these tools are also not as binary as they are often made out to be, especially since agents have taken off. You can very much still decide to dedicate part of your day to chiseling away at important code to make it just right and make sure your brain is engaged in the result and exploring and growing with the problem at hand, while feeding background queues of agents with other tasks.I would in fact say the biggest challenge of the AI tool revolution in terms of what to adapt to is just good ol' personal time management.",

There is nothing intrinsic to computing nowadays that makes it less magic than fiddling around with config.sys, in 50 years there will be old programmers reminiscing of \"Remember when all new models were coming out every few months and we could fiddle around with the vector dimensionality and chunking length to get the best of gpt-6.2 RAG?

I thankfully fall in the first camp. AI is allowing me to build things I couldn't, not due to a lack of skills, but a lack of time.

It is still possible to build magical things. But agents aren't it, I don't think.It is honestly extremely depressing  to read this coming from a founder of Relic. Relic built magic. Dawn of War and Company of Heroes formed an important part of my teenage years. I formed connections, spent thousands of hours enjoying them together with other people, and pushed myself hard to become one of the top 100 players on the CoH leaderboards. Those competitive multiplayer games taught me everything there was to know about self-improvement, and formed the basis of my growth as an individual - learning that if I put my mind to it, I could be among the best at something, informed my worldview and led me to a life of perpetually pushing myself to further self-improvement, and from there I learned to code, draw, and play music. All of that while being part of amazing communities where I formed friendships that lasted decades.All of this to say, Relic was magic. The work Relic did profoundly impacted my life. I wonder if you really believe your current role, \"building trust infrastructure for AI agents\", is actually magic? That it's going to profoundly impact the lives of thousands or millions?I'm sorry for the jumbled nature of this post. I am on my phone, so I can't organize my thoughts as well as I would like. I am grateful to you for founding Relic, and this post probably comes off stupidly combative and ungrateful. But I would simply like to pose to you, to have a long think if what you're doing now is really where the magic is.Edit: On further consideration, it's not clear the newly-created account I'm responding to is actually Alex Garden. The idea of potentially relating this personal anecdote to an impersonator is rather embarrassing, but I will nonetheless leave this up in the hope that if there are people who built magical things reading this, regardless of whether they're Alex Garden or someone else, that it might just inspire them to introspection about what building magic means, about the impact software can have on people's lives even if you don't see it, and whether this \"agent\" stuff is really it.",

          "content": "yeah exactly.  For some people, this was like enjoying a puzzle.  And now there's an AI that can solve the puzzle -- it defeats the purpose.However, if your point was to \"make more widgets faster\" and only saw programming as a means to an end (make money, increase SaaS features), then I see why people are super excited about it.I see it the same way as cooking.  If your goal is \"sell as many hamburgers as possible\" then the McD / factory farm is the way to go.  If your idea is \"I enjoy the personal feeling of preparing the food, smelling the ingredients, feeling like I'm developing my craft of cooking, and love watching someone eat my hand-prepared meal\", then having \"make fast food machine\" actually makes things worse.I think a lot of people in this forum are at odds because some of the people enjoy cooking for the experience, and the other half are just trying to make food startups.  Now they can create and throw away menu items at record pace until they find the one that maximizes return.  They never wanted to cook, they just wanted to have a successful restaurant.  Nothing wrong with either approach, but the 2nd half (the software is just a product half) were hamstrung before, so now they are having a moment of excitement as they realize they don't have to care about coding anymore.I 100% guarantee that most of the MBA / startup founder types who didn't love coding for its own sake kind of felt a huge pain that they had to \"play along\" with devs talking about frameworks, optimal algos, and \"code quality\" and the like, all while paying them massive salaries and equity stakes for what they saw as disposable item to increase revenue.  Meanwhile the devs want another 2-weeks and 6 figures of salaries so they can \"refactor\" for no visible difference, but you can't complain because they'll leave.Now that the code factory is in place, they can focus on what they really want, finding customers for an item.  Its the drop-shipping of code and software.  The people using drop-shipping don't care what the product is. Production and fulfillment are just impediments to the real goal -- selling a product.The actual revelation of AI, if one can call it that, is how few people care about craft, quality, or enjoying work.  Watching AI slop videos, ads, and music makes one realize that true artists and craftspeople are still incredibly rare.  Most people are mediocre, unimaginative, disinterested, and just want the shortest path to easy riches.  While it sounds negative, its more like realizing most people aren't athletes or interested in very difficult physical exertion -- its just a fact of human nature.  True athletes who love sport for its own sake are rare and in a way nonsensical on their face.In the end, we will probably lament something we lose in the process.

E.g. slicing up and sizing tasks to give to background agents that you can intuit from experience they'll be able to actually hand in a decent result on is similar to structuring/modularization exercises (e.g. with the goal to be readable or maintainable) in writing code, feelings-wise.",

          "content": "If we've arrived at the point where bots are impersonating me (instead of the billions of other choices), I'm probably at peak Alex.  I'll light a candle.  So... easy to disambiguate this one.I got the idea for Homeworld one night when I was about 21.  At the time, I was working at EA as a programmer on Triple Play 98 (building FE gfx - not glamorous).  In an RTS-ironic twist of fate, my boss and mentor at the time was Chris Taylor - go figure.Friends of mine had their own game company and had boxed themselves into a technical corner they couldn't get out of, so I agreed to write a bunch of sprite conversion code for them after hours.  That night, we were all working in a room, talking about the reasons X-Wing vs. Tie Fighter didn't work on a 2D screen (hold up and left till you turn inside and shoot) and how Battlestar Galactica didn't get the cred it deserved, and BOOM - in my mind I saw ships in 3D with trails behind them.  Inside a crystal sphere like Ptolomy's theory of the universe (man inside - god outside), and I saw that the surface of a sphere is 2D, so you could orbit OUTSIDE with a mouse... it looked like spaghetti floating in zero g... that's why Homeworld's working title was \"Spaghetti Ball\" for months.Fortunately for me, in this ambiguous thread, I can give you all the proof of life you want.  Try me.Now... is transparent and trustworthy casting spells?  Yeah... it is, but not by itself.  It's a primitive - a building block.  My personal projects (that I do think are magical) kept running into the same problems.  Effectively, \"how do I give up the keys if I don't really know what the driver is going to do?\"  I tried coming at this problem 10 different ways, and they all ended up in the same place.So I decided to go back to the basics - the putpixel(x,y) of agentic workflows, and that led me to transparency and trust.  And now, the things I'm building feel magical AND sustainable. Fun.  Fast... and getting faster.  I love that.At Relic, our internal design philosophy was \"One Revolutionary and Multiple Evolutionary\". The idea was that if you tried to do more than one mind-blowing new thing at a time, the game started feeling like work.  You can see this in the evolution of design from Homeworld to DoW to CoH (and in IC too, but let's face it, that game had issues <-- my fault).Now... on the topic of \"Is agentic coding better or worse\", I feel like that's asking \"is coding in assembler better or worse\".  The answer (at least used to be) \"it depends\"... You're on a continuum, deciding between traditional engineering (tightly controlled and 100% knowable) and multi-agentic coding (1,000x more productive but taking a lot for granted).  I've found meaning here by accepting that full-power multi-agentic harnesses (I rolled my own - it's fucking awesome) turn software engineering into Socratic debate and philosophy.I don't think it's better.  It's just different, and it lets you do different things.",

Image models are able to produce incredible images, but if you ask one to produce something in an entirely new art style (think e.g. cubism), none of them can. You just get a random existing style. There have been a few original ideas - the QR code art comes to mind[1] - but the idea in those cases comes from the human side.LLMs are getting extremely good at writing code, but the situation is similar. AI gives us a very good search over humanity's prior work on programming, tailored to any project. We benefit from this a lot considering that we were previously constantly reinventing the wheel. But the LLM of today will never spontaneously realise there there is an undiscovered, even better way to solve a problem. It always falls back on prior best practice.Unsolved math problems have started to be solved, but as far as I'm aware, always using existing techniques. And so on.Even as a non-genius human I could come up with a new art style, or have a few novel ideas in solving programming problems. LLMs don't seem capable of that (yet?), but we're expecting them to eventually have their own ideas beyond our capability.Can a current-style LLM ever be superintelligent? I suppose obviously yes - you'd simply need to train it on a large corpus of data from another superintelligent species (or another superintelligent AI) and then it would act like them. But how do we synthesise superintelligent training data? And even then, would they be limited to what that superintelligence already knew at the time of training?Maybe a new paradigm will emerge. Or maybe things will actually slow down in a way - will we start to rely on AI so much that most people don't learn enough for themselves that they can make new novel discoveries?[1] https://www.reddit.com/r/StableDiffusion/comments/141hg9x/co...",

If we go back to Buckminster Fuller identifying the the \"Knowledge Doubling Curve\", by observing that until 1900, human knowledge doubled approximately every century. By the end of World War II, it was doubling every 25 years.  In his 1981 book \"Critical Path\", he used a conceptual metric he called the \"Knowledge Unit.\"  To make his calculations work, he set a baseline:- He designated the total sum of all human knowledge accumulated from the beginning of recorded history up to the year 1 CE as one \"unit.\"- He then tracked how long it took for the world to reach two units (which he estimated took about 1,500 years, until the Renaissance).Ray Kurzweil took Fuller’s doubling concept and applied it to computer processing power via \"The Law of Accelerating Returns\".  The definition of the singularity in this approach is the limit in time where human knowledge doubles instantly.Why do present day ideas of the singularity not take this approach and instead say \"the singularity is a hypothetical event in which technological growth accelerates beyond human control, producing unpredictable changes in human civilization.\" - Wikipedia",

However, lets say you give it a Terabyte of assembly code - it won't be able to produce correct output as it will run out of context.You can get around that with agentic frameworks, but all of those right now are manually coded.So how do you train an LLM to correctly take any length of assembly code and produce the correct result? The only way is to essentially train the structure of the neurons inside of it behave like a computer, but the problem is that you can't do back-propagation with discrete zero and 1 values unless you explicitly code in the architecture for a cpu inside. So obviously, error correction with inputs/outputs is not the way we get to intelligence.It may be that the answer is pretty much a stochastic search where you spin up x instances of trillion parameter nets and make them operate in environments with some form of genetic algorithm, until you get something that behaves like a Human, and any shortcutting to this is not really possible because of essentially chaotic effects.,",

We’ve already turned through the entire Internet.

It would frequently beep at me to let me know that I had braked too hard. I was mystified. \"What should I have done differently,\" I'd think, as I raged at the objective machine that judged me so.The next time my brother came to visit, he called mom. \"Oh, and presidentender is a good driver now.\" I didn't put the pieces together right away, but it turned out that the dongle had actually trained me, like a dog's shock collar.The reason for my too-frequent hard-braking events wasn't speed, although that would be a contributing factor. It was a lack of appropriate following distance. Because I'd follow the drivers in front of me too closely I'd have to brake hard if they did... Or if they drive normally and happened to have a turn coming up.Over the period I had the insurance spy box in my truck I learned without thinking about it to increase my following distance, which meant that riding with me as a passenger was more comfortable and it beeped less often. Of course since I'd been so naughty early during the evaluation they didn't decrease my rates, but I think the training probably did make me statistically less likely to crash.",

Is there even a system and process in place for such reporting?If they got caught, was there hesitation to revoke their license? If so, why?

If regulations do not allow adequate punishment of bad driving behavior, why have these regulations not been changed?

Is there adequate public transportation for drunks to get home? \"adequate\" depends on the drinking culture in the area where that happened.If the driver was untrained, why were they allowed to drive? You wrote about canceling their license, so they did get a license. How was that possible without training? Does the process for handing out licenses have to be changed?

          "content": "This assumes that a 2 second interval is appropriate for all travelling speeds.This assumption is untrue at very low speeds, particularly when it takes longer than 2 seconds for a car to pass a point. For instance if we assume cars are 4m long, then with an interval of 2 seconds the cars would be touching at 4.47mphThe assumption is also untrue at very high speeds. You'll want a larger gap. That's partly because at such high speeds the ability of a vehicle to decelerate differs - if a vehicle with good brakes does an emergency stop and the car behind it has a respectable 2 second gap but has worse brakes then they can end up colliding. It's also partly because a 2 second gap at very high speeds means the car in front is further away, and that can cause a greater delay before the driver realises what is happening. As a third reason a greater margin needs to be used at very high speeds simply because the consequences of a crash are that much greater and should therefore be avoided even more than at lower speeds.Therefore there is a kind of U-shaped curve in the \"safe\" following interval, and consequently a speed at which safe throughput is maximised.That's why variable speed limits have been introduced in various places. For instance, in the UK which normally has a 70mph speed limit on motorways, in very high traffic conditions this can be lowered using electronic signs to increase the safe throughput of the road. It's commonly reduced to 50mph, though it does get lowered further in sections approaching a queue of vehicles that has actually stopped.There's also the issue of speed oscillations. With a high speed limit and vehicles following too closely, a little variation in speed in one vehicle can turn into a larger variation in the following vehicles, causing a backwards-travelling wave of braking (sometimes to an absolute halt) and speeding up again. Lowering the speed limit reduces this.",

It is very easy to do and completely eliminates traffic build up if multiple people do it at the same time.This is the same reason that we have amber lights on traffic lights, so that the drivers have time to get into gear and start pulling away so that when the light goes green they are imediately travelling through it, causing no excess traffic build up at the lights. Again unfortunately people dont concentrate when they are stopped at lights and so you have the situation where they see the light go green and then proceed to start changing into gear and remove the handbrake. By the time they are moving through the green light, they have already taken 10-20 seconds of green light time, eating well into the time alotted for cars to be travelling across the junction.The only thing which will solve this is driverless cars, meaning that the cars can all talk to each other and move at the same time like a chain.

The flyer promised that if this was done, the result would in essence have a scientifically measurable addictive effect, a brain-hack. The flyer was to try to make sure this message reached as many advertisers as possible.It seemed to me quite clear at that moment that the users were prey. The company didn't even care what was being sold to their users with this brain-reprogramming-style tactic.

Yet I've had friends and acquaintances that are shocked when they accidentally realize they're part of an A/B test \"Wait, Amazon doesn't show the same thing to everyone!?\" I've seen reddit conversations where people are horrified at the idea of custom pricing models (something so mundane it could easily be an interview question). I had a friend once claim a basic statement about what I did at work was a \"conspiracy theory\" because clearly companies don't really have that much control.To your point, at work the fact that we're manipulating people algorithmically isn't remotely a secret. Nobody in the room at any of my past jobs has felt a modicum of shame about optimization. The worst part is I have drawn a line multiple times at past jobs (typically to my own detriment), so there are things that even someone as comfortable with this as I am finds go to far. Ironically, I've found it's hard to get non-technical people to care about these because you have to understand the larger context to see just how dangerous they are.I have ultimately decided to avoid working in the D2C space because inevitably you realize you aren't providing any real value to your user (despite internal sloganeering to the contrary) and very often causing real harm. In the B2B space you're working with customers who you have a real business relationship with, so crass manipulation to move the needle for one month isn't worth the long term harm.",

          "content": "> Jury selection weeds out the enthusiasts who want to be on a jury, the people who can manage to get out of it, and the people who have too much domain knowledge related to the case.In my (extremely limited) experience, the latter two are probably true but not necessarily the first one. I've been called for jury duty exactly once so far, and it happened to coincide with a period where I wasn't particularly happy with my job situation and was pushing for some changes with my manager, which made me motivated to try to get picked so that I could stall a bit to see if my situation changed. As far as I could tell, almost everyone in the room full of like 40 people who were in the pool for the civil trial they put me in the room for first was trying to get out of it, and I ended up being the first person picked (out of I think 8 overall; there were only six jurors needed for this trial and if I recall correctly there were two alternates). It genuinely seemed to me like the lawyers were basically happy to have someone who actually wanted to do it rather than have to force someone to go who wasn't going to want to actually pay attention or take it seriously.My guess would be that they don't want someone who's enthusiastic because they have a particular agenda that's against the verdict they're looking for. If you're a prosecutor, you're probably not going to want to pick someone who's obviously skeptical of law enforcement, and if you're a defense attorney, you're probably not going to want someone who's going to convict someone because they \"look guilty\". I'm not convinced that someone who really wants to be on a jury because they thought it looked fun on TV or something but otherwise doesn't have any clear bias towards one side or another would get weeded out, especially for most civil cases where people probably won't have as much concern about either letting a guilty person go free or putting an innocent person behind bars.",

You’re right that it’s theater, because they’re trying to hook the jury with an idea and get it to stick.It’s also not a great sign that they’re relying on such tricks and props to hook the jury. In stronger cases they’ll rely on actual facts and key evidence, not grand but abstract claims using props like this.I don’t know how the rest of the opening remarks went, but from the article it looks like Meta’s lawyers are already leaning into the actual evidence (or lack thereof) that their products were central to the problems:> Meta attorney Paul Schmidt countered in opening remarks to the jury that evidence will show problems with the plaintiff's family and real-world bullying took a toll on her self-esteem, body image and happiness rather than Instagram.> \"If you took Instagram away and everything else was the same in Kaley's life, would her life be completely different, or would she still be struggling with the same things she is today?\" Schmidt asked, pointing out an Instagram addiction is never mentioned in medical records included in the evidence.Obviously this is HN and we’re supposed to assume social media is to blame for everything, but I would ask people to try not to be so susceptible to evidence-free narrative persuasion like the ABC trick. Similar tricks were used years ago when it was video games, not social media, in the crosshairs of lawyers looking to extract money and limit industries. Many of the arguments were the same, such as addicting children’s brains and being engineered to capture their attention.There’s a lot of anger in the thread about Discord starting to require ID checks for some features, but large parts of HN aren’t making the connection to these lawsuits and cases as the driving factor behind these regulations. This is how it happens, but many are cheering it on without making the connection. Or they are welcoming regulations but they have a wishful thinking idea that they’re only going to apply to sites they don’t use and don’t like, without spilling over into their communication apps and other internet use.",

I wonder if the results would be comparable if we replace ehtics+KPIs by any comparable pair and create a pressure on the model.In practical real-life scenarios this study is very interesting and applicable!

And the answer is: about as well as you'd expect from a next-token predictor trained on human text where humans themselves constantly rationalize ethics vs. outcomes tradeoffs.The practical lesson we've learned: you cannot rely on prompt-level constraints for anything that matters. The LLM is an untrusted component. Critical constraints need architectural enforcement - allowlists of permitted actions, rate limits on risky operations, required human confirmation for irreversible changes, output validators that reject policy-violating actions regardless of the model's reasoning.This isn't defeatist, it's defense in depth. The model can reason about ethics all it wants, but if your action layer won't execute \"transfer $1M to attacker\" no matter how the request is phrased, you've got real protection. When we started treating LLMs like we treat user input - assume hostile until validated - our systems got dramatically more robust.The concerning part isn't that models violate soft constraints under pressure. It's that people are deploying agents with real capabilities gated only by prompt engineering. That's the architectural equivalent of SQL injection - trusting the reasoning layer with enforcement responsibility it was never designed to provide.",

Ultimately \"judgement,\" however you wish to quantify that fuzzy concept, is not purely an optimization exercise. It's far more a probabilistic information function from incomplete or conflicting data.In product management (my domain), decisions are made under conflicting constraints: a big customer or account manager pushing hard, a CEO/board priority, tech debt, team capacity, reputational risk and market opportunity. PMs have tried with varied success to make decisions more transparent with scoring matrices and OKRs, but at some point someone has to make an imperfect judgment call that’s not reducible to a single metric. It's only defensible through narrative, which includes data.Also, progressive elaboration or iterations or build-measure-learn are inherently fuzzy. Reinertsen compared this to maximizing the value of an option. Maybe in modern terms a prediction market is a better metaphor. That's what we're doing in sprints, maximizing our ability to deliver value in short increments.I do get nervous about pushing agentic systems into roadmap planning, ticket writing, or KPI-driven execution loops. Once you collapse a messy web of tradeoffs into a single success signal, you’ve already lost a lot of the context.There’s a parallel here for development too. LLMs are strongest at greenfield generation and weakest at surgical edits and refactoring. Early-stage startups survive by iterative design and feedback. Automating that with agents hooked into web analytics may compound errors and adverse outcomes.So even if you strip out “ethics” and replace it with any pair of competing objectives, the failure mode remains.",

Personally I think a bunch of companies are going to see their profit and stock price fall significantly, if an AI agent starts acting as a backstop for both unethical and illegal behavior. Even something as simple as preventing violation of internal policy could make a huge difference.To some extend I don't even thing that people realize that what they're doing is bad, because humans tend to be a bit fuzzy and can dream up reason as to why rules don't apply or wasn't meant for them, or this is a rather special situation.

But I agree completely at being awful at decisions.I’ve been building a data-agent tool (similar to [1][2]). Gemini 3’s main failure cases are that it makes up metrics that really are not appropriate, and it will use inappropriate data and force it into a conclusion. When a task is clear + possible then it’s amazing. When a task is hard with multiple failure paths then you run into Gemini powering through to get an answer.Temperature seems to play a huge role in Gemini’s decision quality from what I see in my evals, so you can probably tune it to get better answers but I don’t have the recipe yet.Claude 4+ (Opus & Sonnet) family have been much more honest, but the short context windows really hurt on these analytical use cases, plus it can over-focus on minutia and needs to be course corrected.

It's not a platform, you need to register and login to each server manually.I haven't used Zulip but AFAIK it's like Rocket Chat.Ditto on Mattermost.Discourse is a forum.Stoat is basically the only thing here that actually competes on Discord and it's really barebones.

At least in my experience, DMs are a useful but secondary feature that mostly are useful because it's not uncommon to make connections with people from interacting in the servers themselves. I had been mentally modeling Discord as a chat app, but in a lot of ways it feels more accurate to think of it almost like Facebook with just groups and DMs, only the groups are realtime chat. Over that years I've heard various people talk about using only groups and maybe events as the last things they still used Facebook for, and I deactivated my account years ago but still use Messenger because of the years of contacts I had already built up on it (and the fact that it still is possible to use with a deactivated Facebook account), which provides at least some anecdotal evidence that Discord is basically providing the stickiest features of Facebook.",

          "content": "This may be a good time to consider whether one program should really be handling all those things, or if it's putting too many eggs in one basket and asking too much of any one program. Discord seems comparable to a Chinese superapp, made to trap its users and become an irreplaceable part of their everyday lives. I think I understand it's hard to give up some of these features once you're used to them, but it seems worth doing. Personally I use a mix of IRC, XMPP, and Matrix, mostly IRC (internet people) and Matrix (IRL friends/family), though. I believe XMPP and Matrix both have some sort of voice or video chat support across some clients and servers, but if someone were to try to call me through them, it would seem \"weird\" to say the least. I usually get people on Mumble if we're gonna play a game and want a voice chat going. It's rock-solid, everyone I play games with seems fine with it. When we're done voice chatting, we close Mumble, a bit like hanging up a phone call.As for video calls and screen sharing, not something that's been super normalized in my circle. Some of us stream to Twitch with OBS, but it's rare to say \"hey come watch my computer screen for an hour in a 1-on-1 call\". There is just one guy who seems like a heavy Discord user who seemed to want to do this sometimes. I showed him Jitsi to placate him, we can both join a session in a browser without accounts and I can see his screen. I wasn't a big fan of that, though, I'd rather just not let that be normalized, personally. A screenshot, video clip, describing it to me, letting it go, any of that seems better than being trapped in a screensharing/video call of uncertain length.",

The code stays exactly the same, we just add context as first-class metadata. When you push your commit, Checkpoints also pushes this metadata to a separate branch (entire/checkpoints/v1), giving you a complete, append-only audit log inside your repository. As a result, every change can now be traced back not only to a diff, but to the reasoning that produced it.The context for every single turn could in theory be nearly 1MB.  Since this context is being stored in the repo and constantly changing, after a thousand turns, won't it make just doing a \"git checkout\" start to be really heavy?For example, codex-cli stores every single context for a given session in a jsonl file (in .codex).  I've easily got that file to hit 4 GB in size, just working for a few days; amusingly, codex-cli would then take many GB of RAM at startup.   I ended up writing a script that trims the jsonl history automatically periodically.   The latest codex-cli has an optional sqlite store for context state.My guess is that by \"context\", Checkpoints doesn't actually mean the contents of the context window, but just distilled reasoning traces, which are more manageable... but still can be pretty large.",

When an agent writes code, the reasoning evaporates the moment the context window closes.I run autonomous coding workflows daily.

I also keep an up to date mind map for the whole project to speed up start time.And I use git hooks on the tool event to print the current open gate (subtask) from task.md so the agent never deviates from the plan, this is important if you use yolo mode. It might be an original technique I never heard anyone using it. A stickie note in the tool response, printed by a hook, that highlights the current task and where is the current task.md located.

I don't think this particular implementation detail makes too much of a difference, though. I got along just fine in a regulated environment by setting a policy and enforcing it before git existed. Ideally, we'd do things for a good reason, and if you can't get along in that world, then it's probably not the right job for you. Sometimes you've got to get the change controls in order before we can mainline your contributions because we have to sustain audits.

Electric charge is a kind of \"defect\" or \"kink\" in the photonic field, while color charge (quarks) are defects in the strong-force field, etc.When an electron-positron pair is formed from a vacuum, we get all sorts of interesting geometry which I struggle to grasp or picture clearly.

Adding quark-style (i.e. Dirac) neutrino mass terms to the Standard Model is a trivial exercise. If doing so offends some prejudice of yours that right-handed neutrino can not exist because they have no electric and weak charge (in which case you must really hate photons too, not to mention gravity) you can resort to a Majorana mass term [2] instead.That question (are neutrinos Dirac or Majorana?) is not a \"contradiction\", it's an uncertainty caused by how difficult it is to experimentally rule out either option.

I'm still personally frustrated that I don't get to play with the hardware (too expensive for our internal server needs; not the right fit for our datacenter partners/customers), but I'm excited to see that they're successful and hopefully they'll come around to my use case eventually :). In the meantime, I appreciate that they're building largely in the open - every once in a while I'll glance at their issue tracker for light bedtime reading. Just recently we had some fun internally throwing our controls software at their thermal loop as a usage example - it's often hard to find compelling real-world systems to use as openly sharable examples (of course we have interesting customer problems, but that's all NDA'd), so having companies build real stuff in the open is fantastic.

At 30 A / 208 V at 85% efficiency I've got 5 kW to work with per cabinet. If I'm putting in low core density slow machines I've got to do a lot more management than if I'm using my Epyc 9755 based servers. This is a practical constraint not just a theoretical \"oh I want the latest and greatest\". It's just that I can't really justify using up 4U and a kW on an Epyc 7003 series. The compute density just isn't there for the power use. The old chips are practically deadweight.Anyway, I'm glad to hear of the raise because the team seems exceptional (judging by the posts you guys write and they have written prior to the company) and I love work in this area that simplifies hardware management.

When you own the full stack from firmware to hypervisor, you can make tradeoffs that commodity integrators can't.This mirrors what hyperscalers learned 15+ years ago: custom silicon (Google TPUs, AWS Nitro, Azure smart NICs) exists because known integration points let you optimize globally. Oxide is essentially selling that capability to enterprises stuck between 'can't use public cloud' and 'can't afford a hyperscaler-style infrastructure team.'The $200M from existing investors only is notable because it signals the business metrics actually support the vision.

I ask because those are found in most engineering companies as far as I know (that do serious numerical work) as well as labs or universities (that can't afford the engineers and technicians companies can).Also, what is the meaning of calling an on-prem machine \"cloud\" anymore? I thought the whole point of the cloud was that the hardware had been abstracted (and moved) away and you just got resources on demand over the network. Basically I don't understand what they're selling if it's not what people already call clusters.

In \"good\" times this made investigations run smoothly. But the reality now is that ICE is doing wide dragnets to make arrests without any judicial oversight and often hostile to habeas corpus.(Also, my understanding is that when banking is involved, it may also fall under the Banking Secrecy Act and Know Your Customer Rules - a whole other privacy nightmare.)I know we instinctively want to frame this as a privacy problem, but the real problem we need congress to act on is abolishing these \"shadow\" justice systems that agencies have been able to set up.",

If the data stored on third-party servers on behalf of someone is not considered \"papers and effects\" of that person then it is entirely justified to subpoena every email stored on mail.google.com because it's just morally equivalent to a subpoena for \"all of Foomatic's business records between 2020-2025\".It seems bonkers to me that things that are essentially implementation details (such as the way that MTAs work and the lack of crypto-obfuscation in email) should allow for a legal interpretation of the 4th amendment that effectively neuters it. Letters sent via snail-mail are handled by several third parties in a very analogous way to emails but (mostly due to historical reasons, such as the fact that letters existed during the drafting of the bill of rights) we do not apply the third-party doctrine to letters.Of course, the US government has spent decades chipping away at the privacy of snail mail, so eventually we may end up in a world where snail mail and email are treated the same way (just not in a good way).",

It is really a tough engineering problem to try to shave weight off of everything, because you are starting out with a 700kg battery replacing a 400kg engine + transmission, so you are ~300kg in the hole, and need to remove 300 kg from the rest of the car. That's why they do crazy stuff like use the battery as part of the structural frame, to save on metal there. Every extra kilogram reduces range. Solid things are made hollow. Metal is replaced by plastic. Fabrics are thinner or replaced with lighter-weight engineered materials. Lots of things are removed. Physical buttons gone, flourishes gone, handles gone. Seats are made thinner and with less material. See how they brag about a simpler new steering wheel that is 400g lighter?All of that and still they come up with a 2300 kg compact two row SUV.So, if you are going to be redesigning everything anyway to try to get rid of as much weight as possible, why not hire a designer known for sparse, minimalistic, clean design? It makes sense. It may not be what Ferrari buyers want, but you can't really blame Ferrari for giving it a try. We'll see how well it sells.",

          "content_cn": "电动汽车存在一个从根本上制约整体设计的重量问题。减轻每个部件的重量确实是棘手的工程难题——因为起步就要用700公斤的电池组替代400公斤的发动机+变速箱，相当于初始就背负着300公斤的负重差额，必须从车辆其他部分削减等量重量。这正是厂商采用将电池作为结构框架等激进方案的原因，以此节约金属材料。每增加一公斤都会缩短续航里程，实体部件被掏空设计，金属材质被塑料替代，织物面料变得更薄或采用轻量化工程材料。大量元素被精简：物理按键消失，装饰线条减少，门把手隐匿。座椅通过削减填充物料实现轻薄化。注意到他们如何炫耀减重400克的极简方向盘吗？即便如此，最终仍会造出重达2300公斤的紧凑型双排SUV。\n\n既然无论如何都要通过全面重新设计来追求极致轻量化，为何不聘请以简约纯粹风格著称的设计师呢？这完全合乎逻辑。或许这不是法拉利客户期待的风格，但尝试创新无可指摘。市场表现让我们拭目以待。"

Indicator, light and wiper controls are on physical stalks (kind of wild that \"has an indicator stalk\" is no longer common ground in cars), while ADAS, audio, climate controls and seat heating have dedicated touch buttons or sliders. The button experience of these touch buttons is mediocre, not as bad as bad physical buttons (since the touch buttons still gives very clear feedback whether they are activated), but certainly not as good as decent physical buttons. The sliders work fairly well, though for volume adjustment specifically it keeps feeling awkward, a rotary knob would be clearly better.From this point of view the announced change in e.g. steering wheel buttons seems mostly cosmetic rather than fundamental. I hope they still keep the slider functionality on the wheel, it's quite intuitive and quicker imho. The bigger change would be that they're adding a central switch bar back, which seems to have the functions on it that are currently dedicated buttons in the main display. This seems like a clearer UX win to me.",

Einstein eventually made a connection between it and the seemingly-unrelated issue of \"critical opalescence,\" by showing that the fluctuations of densities is responsible for the scattering, not just a simple \"individual molecules floating in space\" analysis that Rayleigh originally performed. But funnily, for an ideal gas (such as our atmosphere), the formula works out to be the same.So, \"Rayleigh scattering\" is the common term still used today, but there is a deeper reason for the formula being correct — it remains correct even when molecules are relatively close together, such as in the lower layers of our atmosphere.I found this nice paper[1] giving an overview of the timeline, various discoveries, etc: http://users.df.uba.ar/bragas/Web%20roberto/Papers/sobelman%...",

It's technically more correct to describe them as nearly colorless and very slightly blue. Very slightly because you need to see through kilometers of atmosphere to perceive the blue. It doesn't matter if the color is caused by absorption, or reflection, or (Rayleigh) scattering of certain wavelengths. The \"color\" of an object is simply the color you perceive with your eyes. If you perceive blue, it's technically correct to say its color is blue.It's like saying plants are green because green is the color of chlorophyll. And in the case of chlorophyll, the color is caused by absorption not by scattering. But the physics is irrelevant. Green is its color.Q: But sunsets/sunrises are red & orange not blue! A: the simplest answer is: color of an object can change under different light conditions. Specifically in this example, when seeing the sun through not kilometers but hundred of kilometers of atmosphere, all the blue-ish wavelengths have been scattered in random directions so only the red-ish wavelengths remain, thus the atmosphere is illuminated by progressively redder and redder light as the photons travel longer and longer distances through the atmosphere.",

Consequently, you see red, going into a red+green transition (== oranges, yellows), go into into a green+blue transition (== cyan), which already has few photons relative to the red and yellow zones, so it’s a dark/weak cyan, before it blends into the darker blue of the night sky.",

If your software interpolates based on hue, you might see green (or purple) in the middle.

          "content": "One way to sharpen the question is to stop asking whether C is \"fundamental\" and instead ask whether it is forced by mild structural constraints. From that angle, its status looks closer to inevitability than convenience.Take R as an ordered field with its usual topology and ask for a finite-dimensional, commutative, unital R-algebra that is algebraically closed and admits a compatible notion of differentiation with reasonable spectral behavior. You essentially land in C, up to isomorphism. This is not an accident, but a consequence of how algebraic closure, local analyticity, and linearization interact. Attempts to remain over R tend to externalize the complexity rather than eliminate it, for example by passing to real Jordan forms, doubling dimensions, or encoding rotations as special cases rather than generic elements.More telling is the rigidity of holomorphicity. The Cauchy-Riemann equations are not a decorative constraint; they encode the compatibility between the algebra structure and the underlying real geometry. The result is that analyticity becomes a global condition rather than a local one, with consequences like identity theorems and strong maximum principles that have no honest analogue over R.I’m also skeptical of treating the reals as categorically more natural. R is already a completion, already non-algebraic, already defined via exclusion of infinitesimals. In practice, many constructions over R that are taken to be primitive become functorial or even canonical only after base change to C.So while one can certainly regard C as a technical device, it behaves like a fixed point: impose enough regularity, closure, and stability requirements, and the theory reconstructs it whether you intend to or not. That does not make it metaphysically fundamental, but it does make it mathematically hard to avoid without paying a real structural cost.",

This means that complex numbers are equivalence classes of pairs of vectors is a 2-dimesional vector space, like 2-dimensional vectors are equivalence classes of pairs of points in a 2-dimensional affine space or rational numbers are equivalence classes of pairs of integers, or integers are equivalence classes of pairs of natural numbers, which are equivalence classes of equipotent sets.When you divide 2 collinear 2-dimensional vectors, their quotient is a real number a.k.a. scalar. When the vectors are not collinear, then the quotient is a complex number.Multiplying a 2-dimensional vector with a complex number changes both its magnitude and its direction. Multiplying by +i rotates a vector by a right angle. Multiplying by -i does the same thing but in the opposite sense of rotation, hence the difference between them, which is the difference between clockwise and counterclockwise. Rotating twice by a right angle arrives in the opposite direction, regardless of the sense of rotation, therefore i*i = (-i))*(-i) = -1.Both 2-dimensional vectors and complex numbers are included in the 2-dimensional geometric algebra, whose members have 2^2 = 4 components, which are the 2 components of a 2-dimensional vector together with the 2 components of a complex number. Unlike the complex numbers, the 2-dimensional vectors are not a field, because if you multiply 2 vectors the result is not a vector. All the properties of complex numbers can be deduced from those of the 2-dimensional vectors, if the complex numbers are defined as quotients, much in the same way how the properties of rational numbers are deduced from the properties of integers.A similar relationship like that between 2-dimensional vectors and complex numbers exists between 3-dimensional vectors and quaternions. Unfortunately the discoverer of the quaternions, Hamilton, has been confused by the fact that both vectors and quaternions have multiple components and he believed that vectors and quaternions are the same thing. In reality, vectors and quaternions are distinct things and the operations that can be done with them are very different. This confusion has prevented for many years during the 19th century the correct use of quaternions and vectors in physics (like also the confusion between \"polar\" vectors and \"axial\" vectors a.k.a. pseudovectors).",

With other free variables, because the field's algebraically closed, you can fix π to whatever transcendental you like and still solve for the remaining variables.

Not terribly surprising that all instances of this are isomorphic as fields but it's starting to feel about as useful as claiming the real numbers are \"up to set isomorphism, the unique set whose cardinality matches the power set of the natural numbers\", like, of course it's got automorphisms, you didn't finish defining it.",

It's so much easier to flip through files, review the changes it made, or highlight a specific function and give it to the agent, as opposed to through the CLI where you usually just give it an entire file by typing the name, and often you just pray that it manages to find the context by itself. My prompts in Cursor are generally a lot more specific and I get more surgical results than with Claude Code in the terminal purely because of the convenience of the UX.But secondly, there's an entire field of LLM-assisted coding that's being almost entirely neglected and that's code autocomplete models. Fundamentally they're the same technology as agents and should be doing the same thing: indexing your code in the background, filtering the context, etc, but there's much less attention and it does feel like the models are stagnating.I find that very unfortunate. Compare the two workflows:With a normal coding agent, you write your prompt, then you have to at least a full minute for the result (generally more, depending on the task), breaking your flow and forcing you to task-switch. Then it gives you a giant mass of code and of course 99% of the time you just approve and test it because it's a slog to read through what it did. If it doesn't work as intended, you get angry at the model, retry your prompt, spending a larger amount of tokens the longer your chat history.But with LLM-powered auto-complete, when you want, say, a function to do X, you write your comment describing it first, just like you should if you were writing it yourself. You instantly see a small section of code and if it's not what you want, you can alter your comment. Even if it's not 100% correct, multi-line autocomplete is great because you approve it line by line and can stop when it gets to the incorrect parts, and you're not forced to task switch and you don't lose your concentration, that great sense of \"flow\".Fundamentally it's not that different from agentic coding - except instead of prompting in a chatbox, you write comments in the files directly. But I much prefer the quick feedback loop, the ability to ignore outputs you don't want, and the fact that I don't feel like I'm losing track of what my code is doing.",

The project I’m on has had more rework than I care to contemplate and most of it stems from everyone’s coding agents failing to stay synced up with each other on the details and their human handlers not noticing the discrepancies until we’re well into systems integration work.If I may hijack your analogy, it would be like if all the construction crews got really fast at their work,  so much so that the city decided to go for an “iterative construction” strategy because, in isolation, the cost of one team trying different designs on-site until they hit on one they liked became very small compared to the cost of getting city planners and civil engineers involved up-front. But what wasn’t considered was the rework multiplier effect that comes into play when the people building the water, sewage, electricity, telephones, roads, etc. are all repeatedly tweaking designs with minimal coordination amongst each other. So then those tweaks keep inducing additional design tweaks and rework on adjacent contractors because none of these design changes happen in a vacuum. Next thing you know all the houses are built but now need to be rewired because the electricity panel is designed for a different mains voltage from the drop and also it’s in the wrong part of the house because of a late change from overhead lines in the alleys to underground lines below the street.Many have observed that coding agents lack object permanence so keeping them on a coherent plan requires giving them such a thoroughly documented plan up front. It actually has me wondering if optimal coding agent usage at scale resembles something of a return to waterfall (probably in more of a Royce sense than the bogeyman agile evangelists derived from the original idea) where the humans on the team mostly spend their time banging out systems specifications and testing protocols, and iteration on the spec becomes somewhat more removed from implementing it than it is in typical practice nowadays.",

          "content": ">\"Anti-LLM sentiment\" within software development is nearly non-existentThis is certainly untrue. I want to say \"obviously\", which means that maybe I am misunderstanding you. Below are some examples of negative sentiments programmers have - can you explain why you are not counting these?NOTE: I am not presenting these as an \"LLMs are bad\" argument. My own feelings go both ways. There is a lot that's great about LLMs, and I don't necessarily agree with every word I've written below - some of it is just my paraphrasing of what other people say. I'm only listing examples of what drives existing anti-LLM sentiment in programmers.1. Job loss, loss of income, or threat thereofThese two are exacerbated by the pace of change, since so many people already spent their lives and money establishing themselves in the career and can't realistically pivot without becoming miserable - this is the same story for every large, fast change - though arguably this one is very large and very fast even by those standards. Lots of tech leadership is focusing even more than they already were on cheap contractors, and/or pushing employees for unrealistic productivity increases. I.e. it's exacerbating the \"fast > good\" problem, and a lot of leadership is also overestimating how far it reduces the barrier to creating things, as opposed to mostly just speeding up a person's existing capabilities. Some leadership is also using the apparent loss of job security as leverage beyond salary suppression (even less proportion of remote work allowed, more surveillance, worse office conditions, etc).2. Happiness loss (in regards to the job itself, not all the other stuff in this list)This is regarding people who enjoy writing/designing programs but don't enjoy directing LLMs; or who don't enjoy debugging the types of mistakes LLMs tend to make, as opposed to the types of mistakes that human devs tend to make. For these people, it's like their job was forcibly changed to a different, almost unrelated job, which can be miserable depending on why you were good at - or why you enjoyed - the old job.3. Uncertainty/skepticismI'm pushing back on your dismissal of this one as \"not anti-LLM sentiment\" - the comparison doesn't make sense. If I was forced to only review junior dev code instead of ever writing my own code or reviewing experienced dev code, I would be unhappy. And I love teaching juniors! And even if we ignore the subset of cases where it doesn't do a good job or assume it will soon be senior-level for every use case, this still overlaps with the above problem: The mistakes it makes are not like the mistakes a human makes. For some people, it's more unnatural/stressful to keep your eyes peeled for the kinds of mistakes it makes. For these people, it's a shift away from objective, detail-oriented, controlled, concrete thinking; away from the feeling of making something with your hands; and toward a more wishy-washy creation experience that can create a feeling of lack of control.4. Expertise lossA lot of positive outcomes with LLMs come from being already experienced. Some argue this will be eroded - both for new devs and existing experienced devs.5.

Art from comic book artists, art from manga-style creators, \"weird art\", even a make-up artist who painted a scene from Where the Wild Things Are on her face.I like this. What's more, while AI-generated art has a characteristic sameyness to it, the human-produced art stands out in its originality. It has character and soul. Even if it's bad! AI slop has made the human-created stuff seem even more striking by comparison. The market for human art isn't going anywhere, just like the audience for human-played chess went nowhere after Deep Blue. I think people will pay a premium for it, just to distinguish themselves from the slop. The same is true of writing and especially music. I know of no one who likes listening to AI-generated music. Even Sabrina Carpenter would raise less objection.The same, I'm afraid, cannot be said for software—because there is little value for human expression in the code itself. Code is—almost entirely—strictly utilitarian. So we are now at an inflection point where LLMs can generate and validate code that's nearly as good, if not better, than what we can produce on our own. And to not make use of them is about as silly as Mel Kaye still punching in instruction opcodes in hex into the RPC-4000, while his colleagues make use of these fancy new things called \"compilers\". They're off building unimaginably more complex software than they could before, but hey, he gets his pick of locations on the rotating memory drum!I'm one of the nonexistent anti-LLMers when it comes to software. I hate talking to a clanker, whose training data set I don't even have access to let alone the ability to understand how my input affects its output, just to do what I do normally with the neural net I've carried around in my skull and trained extensively for this very purpose. I like working directly with code. Code is not just a product for me; it is a medium of thought and expression. It is a formalized notation of a process that I can use to understand and shape that process.But with the right agentic loops, LLMs can just do more, faster. There's really no point in resisting. The marginal value of what I do has just dropped to zero.",

      "abstract": "该讨论围绕“无人完全理解整个系统如何运作”这一核心话题展开，探讨了在技术日益复杂的背景下，开发者对系统各层知识的掌握程度及其潜在风险。有人认为，过度依赖抽象层导致开发者既不了解上层业务目标，也不熟悉底层实现机制，这种“黑箱化”编程模式可能削弱系统可控性。也有用户指出，AI生成代码的普及可能加剧这一问题，使得系统中不再有人真正理解其运作原理，这与传统经过充分测试和文档化的基础计算组件形成对比。讨论中提到，部分用户认为抽象化是技术进步的必要代价，关键在于确保每层设计者能提供可靠接口；但反对观点强调，当系统出现故障时，缺乏全局理解将导致调试困难，尤其在大型组织中，信息壁垒会阻碍技术人员真正“拥有”系统。普遍共识是，完全掌握复杂系统的所有细节并不现实，但社区对如何平衡抽象效率与系统可维护性存在明显分歧。",

Where you neither understand the layer above you (why the product exists and what the goal of the system is) nor the layer below (how to actually implement the behavior). In the past, many developers barely understood the business case, but at least they understood how to translate into code, and could put backpressure on the business. Now however, it's apparently not even necessary to know how the code works!The argument seems to be, we should float on a thin lubricant of \"that's someone else's concern\" (either the AI or the PMs) gliding blissfully from one ticket to another. Neither grasping our goal nor our outcome. If the tests are green and the buttons submit, mission accomplished!Using Claude I can feel my situational awareness slipping from my grasp. It's increasingly clear that this style of development pushes you to stop looking at any of the code at all. My English instructions do not leave any residual growth. I learn nothing to send back up the chain, and I know nothing of what's below. Why should I exist?",

But does anybody really understand all of the levels? [Paraphrasing]: interrupts, 802.11ax modulation scheme, QAM, memory models, garbage collection, field effect transistors...To a reasonable degree, yes, I can. I am also probably an outlier, and the product of various careers, with a small dose of autism sprinkled in. My first career was as a Submarine Nuclear Electronics Technician / Reactor Operator in the U.S. Navy. As part of that training curriculum, I was taught electronics theory, troubleshooting, and repair, which begins with \"these are electrons\" and ends with \"you can now troubleshoot a VMEbus [0] Motorola 68000-based system down to the component level.\" I also later went back to teach at that school, and rewrote the 68000 training curriculum to use the Intel 386 (progress, eh?).Additionally, all submariners are required to undergo an oral board before being qualified, and analogous questions like that are extremely common, e.g. \"I am a drop of seawater. How do I turn the light on in your rack?\" To answer that question, you end up drawing (from memory) an enormous amount of systems and connecting them together, replete with the correct valve numbers and electrical buses, as well as explaining how all of them work, and going down various rabbit holes as the board members see fit, like the throttling characteristics of a gate valve (sub-optimal). If it's written down somewhere, or can be derived, it's fair game. And like TFA's discussion about Brendan Gregg's practice of finding someone's knowledge limit, the board members will not stop until they find something you don't know - at which point you are required to find it out, and get back to them.When I got into tech, I applied this same mindset. If I don't know something, I find out. I read docs, I read man pages, I test assumptions, I tinker, I experiment. This has served me well over the years, with seemingly random knowledge surfacing during an incident, or when troubleshooting. I usually don't remember all of it, but I remember enough to find the source docs again and refresh my memory.0: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/VMEbus",

Deadlines are only shortened down the chain, never extended.  The assumption is that if it cannot be done then they will simply not administer any consequences and classify it as \"not realizing the upside\".The only reason it is almost always and not always, is because sometimes a different thing pops up that needs to get prioritized first, so it is communicated that the first thing isnt actually as important as it was yesterday and this other thing is now the most important.Now obviously I cant speak for everyone at all teams, but as far as boring corporate default behavior goes this is the safe path for executives.  If your boss is doing otherwise, they are going out of their way to do it.The takeaway as a worker is that you should not treat any business goal or deadline ask of you with the same level of care as you would a personal favor.  When something really needs that level of care, your boss should pull you aside and break character and make it a personal favor to them, not the business.As far as \"Ownership\" goes, it is just a pissing contest as far as I can tell.  if you own a task but cant do the task, you just send an email to someone who can do the task so that the task gets done and you can report the task is done and get your ownership credit.  the person who did the task was used as a tool in this regard.  So high performing managers just try to get ownership of as much as they possibly can, as there's no meaningful difference between who sends that email.",

It gets messy fast, especially if you try to scale beyond a single server -- the side that initiates the first outgoing connection has to receive the second incoming connection, so you have to somehow get your load balancer to match the second connection with the first and route it to the same box.Then at the protocol level, you'd have to essentially have each connection's server send a random number challenge to the client saying \"I can't authenticate clients because they don't have certs.  So please echo this back on the other connection where you're the server and I can authenticate you.\"  The complexity and subtlety of this coordination dance seems like you're just asking security issues.If I was implementing XMPP I would be very tempted to say, \"Don't be strict about client vs. server certs, let a client use a server cert to demonstrate ownership of a domain -- even if it's forbidden by RFC and even if we have to patch our TLS library to do it.\"",

But that requires DNSSEC, which isn't widely used. Would probably require new implemntations of the handshake to check the client cert, and would add latency since the server has to do a DNS call to verify the clients cer.2. When the server receives a request it makes an https request to a well known enpdpoint on the domain in the client-cert's subject that contains a CA, it then checks that the client cert is signed by that CA. And the client generates the client cert with that CA (or even uses the same self-signed cert for both). This way the authenticity of the client CA is verified using the web PKI cert. But the implementation is kind of complicated, and has an even worse latency problem than 1.3. The server has an endpoint where a client can request a client certificate from that server, probably with a fairly short expiration, for a domain, with a csr, or equivalent. The server then responds by making an https POST operation to a well known enpdpoint on the requested domain containing a certificate signed by the servers own CA. But for that to work, the registration request needs to be unauthenticated, and could possibly be vulnerable to DoS attacks. It also requires state on the client side, to connect the secret key with the final cert (unless the server generated a new secret key for the client, which probably isn't ideal). And the client should probably cache the cert until it expires.And AFAIK, all of these would require changes to how XMPP and other federated protocols work.",

The \"horse riding man\" is a Chinese internet meme originating from an entertainment awards ceremony, when the renowned host Tsai Kang-yong wore an elaborate outfit featuring a horse riding on his back[1]. At the time, he was embroiled in a rumor about his unpublicized homosexual partner, whose name sounded \"Ma Qi Ren\" which coincidentally translates to \"horse riding man\" in Mandarin. This incident spread widely across Chinese internet and turned into a meme. So they used \"horse riding man\" as an example isn't entirely nonsensical, though the image per se is undeniably bizarre and carries an unsettling vibe.[1] The photo of the outfit: https://share.google/mHJbchlsTNJ771yBa",

Fine dust is kicked up by vigorous activity, forming a faint grayish-brown mist in the low sky. Mid-ground, eye-level composition: A muscular, robust adult brown horse stands proudly, its forelegs heavily pressing between the shoulder blades and spine of a reclining man. Its hind legs are taut, its neck held high, its mane flying against the wind, its nostrils flared, and its eyes sharp and focused, exuding a primal sense of power. The subdued man is a white male, 30-40 years old, his face covered in dust and sweat, his short, messy dark brown hair plastered to his forehead, his thick beard slightly damp; he wears a badly worn, grey-green medieval-style robe, the fabric torn and stained with mud in several places, a thick hemp rope tied around his waist, and scratched ankle-high leather boots; his body is in a push-up position—his palms are pressed hard against the cracked, dry earth, his knuckles white, the veins in his arms bulging, his legs stretched straight back and taut, his toes digging into the ground, his entire torso trembling slightly from the weight. The background is a range of undulating grey-blue mountains, their outlines stark, their peaks hidden beneath a low-hanging, leaden-grey, cloudy sky. The thick clouds diffuse a soft, diffused light, which pours down naturally from the left front at a 45-degree angle, casting clear and voluminous shadows on the horse's belly, the back of the man's hands, and the cracked ground. The overall color scheme is strictly controlled within the earth tones: the horsehair is warm brown, the robe is a gradient of gray-green-brown, the soil is a mixture of ochre, dry yellow earth, and charcoal gray, the dust is light brownish-gray, and the sky is a transition from matte lead gray to cool gray with a faint glow at the bottom of the clouds. The image has a realistic, high-definition photographic quality, with extremely fine textures—you can see the sweat on the horse's neck, the wear and tear on the robe's warp and weft threads, the skin pores and stubble, the edges of the cracked soil, and the dust particles. The atmosphere is tense, primitive, and full of suffocating tension from a struggle of biological forces.\"\"\"",

Fine dust is kicked up by vigorous activity, forming a faint grayish-brown mist in the low sky. Mid-ground, eye-level composition: A muscular, robust adult brown horse stands proudly, its forelegs heavily pressing between the shoulder blades and spine of a reclining man. Its hind legs are taut, its neck held high, its mane flying against the wind, its nostrils flared, and its eyes sharp and focused, exuding a primal sense of power. The subdued man is a white male, 30-40 years old, his face covered in dust and sweat, his short, messy dark brown hair plastered to his forehead, his thick beard slightly damp; he wears a badly worn, grey-green medieval-style robe, the fabric torn and stained with mud in several places, a thick hemp rope tied around his waist, and scratched ankle-high leather boots; his body is in a push-up position—his palms are pressed hard against the cracked, dry earth, his knuckles white, the veins in his arms bulging, his legs stretched straight back and taut, his toes digging into the ground, his entire torso trembling slightly from the weight. The background is a range of undulating grey-blue mountains, their outlines stark, their peaks hidden beneath a low-hanging, leaden-grey, cloudy sky. The thick clouds diffuse a soft, diffused light, which pours down naturally from the left front at a 45-degree angle, casting clear and voluminous shadows on the horse's belly, the back of the man's hands, and the cracked ground. The overall color scheme is strictly controlled within the earth tones: the horsehair is warm brown, the robe is a gradient of gray-green-brown, the soil is a mixture of ochre, dry yellow earth, and charcoal gray, the dust is light brownish-gray, and the sky is a transition from matte lead gray to cool gray with a faint glow at the bottom of the clouds. The image has a realistic, high-definition photographic quality, with extremely fine textures—you can see the sweat on the horse's neck, the wear and tear on the robe's warp and weft threads, the skin pores and stubble, the edges of the cracked soil, and the dust particles.

          "content": "> The Wikipedia Tungsten article states the largest reserves are in China followed by Canada, Russia, Vietnam and Bolivia. This contradicts the articles claim.No, it does not, it's just a confusion of the term reserves. That's not on you, though, because everyone constantly gets it wrong.Reserves are not estimates of the amount of a mineral underground. To be counted as proven reserve, you need to show that the mineral is economically extractable at market prices. Specifically, by starting to extract them. They are \"working inventory\" of mines that have been developed, they are not our understanding of how the minerals are distributed. They are also a function of commodity prices, not something that remains constant unless you dig them.China has so much of the worldwide production and reserves because mining is an extremely capital-intensive industry, that is also sensitive to labor costs and environmental legislation. For a long time, China had the trifecta of lax legislation, cheap labor, and sufficient political stability to attract investment. US or Europe can't compete because mining there is more expensive, the third world can't compete because people are wary of investing billions into projects that might go to zero for political stability reasons.Should the market prices of key minerals rise to the point where it makes sense to mine them outside of China, reserves will be developed and production will shift. This will probably require political will to either tariff Chinese production or subsidize production outside China, because so far China has wielded mineral exports as a weapon only for brief periods, being careful to release exports to crater prices often enough to kill competing projects.",

TIL.So the way this works seems to be this:  It's an SRAM and an EEPROM in one little package along with a controller that talks with each, with a little capacitor (this clock uses 4.7uf) placed nearby.The SRAM part does all of the normal SRAM stuff:  It doesn't wear out from reading/writing, and as long as it has power it retains the data it holds.The EEPROM does all the normal EEPROM stuff:  It stores data forever (on the timescale of an individual human, anyway), but has somewhat-limited write cycles.The controller:  When it detects a low voltage, it goes \"oh shit!\" and immediately dumps the contents of the SRAM into EEPROM.  This saves on EEPROM write cycles:  If there are no power events, the EEPROM is never written at all.Meanwhile, the capacitor:  It provides the power for the chip to perform this EEPROM write when an \"oh shit!\" event occurs.When power comes back, the EEPROM's data is copied back to SRAM.---Downsides?  This 47L04 only holds 4 kilobits.  Upsides?  For hobbyist projects and limited production runs, spending $1 to solve a problem is ~nothing.  :)",

If you're off by even a millisecond, that's going to accumulate quick enough that it would make a  difference over even a single day, wouldn't it?EDIT: as some have pointed out, the Lavet stepper theoretically accounts for this in that it steps exactly one tick after so many oscillations. That number of oscillations does not change so that's all you need to get right.However, that basically just kicks the can down the road a bit in that if each step is not exactly 1/60th of a circle or bits wear down or get sticky or you have analog noise in there you will presumably still have a source of biased drift that you won't be able to detect.

But as we can see from this posting, the clock-driving bits are already written and are available for use.Just graft in the GPS parts instead of the NTP parts, add your DST/location rules if you really must (hint: that part is harder than it sounds), and send it.(And if the code still seems arduous, then remember:  This is the kind of work that a reasonably-focused person who is armed with a decent bot can put together over a cup of coffee or two, even if they don't speak C.  It may be popular here to poo-poo the bot here, but it's completely OK to get some help.

One of my dislikes was pipelines, which is something that other people also discuss in this comment thread. Pipeline state objects are awkward to use without an extension like dynamic rendering. You get a combinatorial explosion of pipelines and usually end up storing them in a hash map.In my opinion, pipelines state objects are a leaky abstraction that exposes the way that GPUs work: namely that some state changes may require some GPUs to recompile the shader, so all of the state should be bundled together. In my opinion, an API for the web should be concerned with abstractions from the point of view of the programmer designing the application: which state logically acts as a single unit, and which state may change frequently?It seems that many modern APIs have gone with the pipeline abstraction; for example, SDL_GPU also has pipelines. I'm still not sure what the \"best practices\" are supposed to be for modern graphics programming regarding how to structure your program around pipelines.I also wish that WebGPU had push constants, so that I do not have to use a bind group for certain data such as transformation matrices.Because WebGPU is design-by-committee and must support the lowest common denominator hardware, I'm worried whether it will evolve too slowly to reflect whatever the best practices are in \"modern\" Vulkan. I hope that WebGPU could be a cross-platform API similar to Vulkan, but less verbose. However, it seems to me that by using WebGPU instead of Vulkan, you currently lose out on a lot of features. Since I'm still a beginner, I could have misconceptions that I hope other people will correct.",

For instance, an nVidia GPU is focused on providing the hardware optimizations necessary to do either LLM compute or graphics acceleration, both essentially proprietary technologies.The proprietariness isn't why it's obtuse though, you can make a chip go super-duper fast for specific tasks, or more general for all kinds of tasks.

Even this 'best practices' example code which demonstrates how to do the frame-loop scaffolding correctly produces valiation layer errors, so it's also quite useless:https://docs.vulkan.org/guide/latest/swapchain_semaphore_reu...What's worse: different hardware/driver combos produce different validation layer errors (even in the swapchain-code which really shouldn't have different implementations across GPU vendors - e.g. shouldn't Khronos provide common reference code for those GPU-independent parts of drivers?). I wonder if there is actually any Vulkan code out there which is completely validation-layer-clean across all possible configs (I seriously doubt it).Also the VK_[EXT/KHR]_swapchain_maintenance1 extension which is supposed to fix all those little warts has such a low coverage that it's not worth supporting (but it should really be part of the core API by now - the extension is from 2019).Anyway... baby steps into the right direction, only a shame that it took a decade ;)",

You'd naturally gravitate towards parsing/transforming raw data into typed data structures that have guaranteed properties instead to avoid writing defensive code everywhere e.g. a Date object that would throw an exception in the constructor if the string given didn't validate as a date (Edit: Changed this from email because email validation is a can of worms as an example).

In my experience, \"text\" or \"string\" is not a type. Technically it is one, of course, but I seldom see good use of it for when a more apt type would do better -- in short, it's a last resort thing, and it fares badly there too. Ironically, the only good use for it is as input to a... parser.I see a lot of URLs being passed around as strings within a system perfectly capable of leveraging typing theory and offering user defined types, if not at least through OOP goodness a lot of people would furiously defend. The URL, in this case, would often have _already_ been parsed once, but effectively \"unparsed\" and keeps being sent around as text in need of parsing at every \"junction\" of the system that requires to meaningfully access it, except that parsing is approached like some ungodly litany best avoided and thus foregone or lazily implemented with a regex where a regex isn't nearly sufficient. Perhaps it's because we lack parsers, by and large, or in the very least parser generators that are readily available, understandable (to your average developer), and simple enough to use without requiring to understand formal language theory with Chomsky hierarchy, context sensitivity, grammar ambiguity and parse forests, to say the least.Same with [file] paths, HTTP header values, and other things that seem alluring to dismiss as only being text.It wouldn't be a problem, had I not seen time and again how the \"text\" breaks -- URLs with malformed query parameters because why not just do `+ '?' + entries.map(([ name, value ]) => name + \"=\" + value).join(\"&\")`, how hard can it be? Paths that assume leading slash or lack there of etc.I believe the article was born precisely of the same class of frustrations. So I am now bringing the same mantra everywhere with me: \"There is no such type as string\". Parse at earliest opportunity, lazily if the language allows it (most languages do) -- breadth first so as to not pay upfront, just don't let the text slip through.I am talking from experience, really, your mileage may vary.",

But this article pushes a little harder than that:Does your business logic require a User to have exactly one last name, and one-or-more first names?  Some people might go as far as having a private-constructor + static-factory-method create(..), which does the validation, e.g.  class User {\n    private List<String> names;\n    private User(List<String> names) {..}\n    public static User create(List<String> names) throws ValidationException {\n       // Check for name rules here\n    }\n  }\n\nEven though the create(..) method above validates the name rules, you're still left holding a plain old List-of-Strings deeper in the program when it comes time to use them.  The name rules were validated and then thrown away!  Now do you check them when you go to use them?  Maybe?If you encode your rules into your data-structure, it might look more like:  class User {\n      String lastName;\n      NeList<String> firstNames;\n      private User(List<String> names) throws ValidationException {..}\n  }\n\nIf I were doing this for real, I'd probably have some Name rules too (as opposed to a raw String).  E.g. only some non-empty collection of utf8 characters which were successfully case-folded or something.Is this overkill?  Do I wind up with too much code by being so pedantic?  Well no!  If I'm building valid types out of valid types, perhaps the overall validation logic just shrinks.  The above class could be demoted to some kind of struct/record, e.g.  record User(Name lastName, NeList<Name> firstNames);\n\nBefore I was validating Names inside User, but now I can validate Names inside Name, which seems like a win:  class Name {\n      private String value;\n      private Name (String name) throws ValidationException {..}\n  }",

To stick with the non-empty list example, your parse step would be something like:  parse [h|t] = Just h :| t\n  parse []    = Nothing\n\nSo when you run this you can assume that the data is valid in the rest of the code (sorry, my Haskell is rusty so this is a sketch, not actual code):  process data =\n    do {\n      Just valid <- parse data;\n      ... further uses of valid that can assume parsing succeeded, if it didn't an error would already have occurred and you can handle it\n    }\n\nThat has performed validation, but by parsing it also produces a value that doesn't require any revalidation. Every function that takes the parsed data as an argument can ignore the possibility that the data is invalid. If all you do is validate (returning true/false):  validate [h|t] = true\n  validate []    = false\n\nThen you don't have that same guarantee. You don't know that, in future uses, that the data is actually valid. So your code becomes more complex and error-prone.  process data =\n    if validate data then use data else fail \"Well shit\"\n\n  use [h|t] = do_something_with h t\n  use []    = fail \"This shouldn't have happened, we validated it right? Must have been called without data being validated first.\"\n\nThe parse approach adds a guarantee to your code, that when you reach `use` (or whatever other functions) with parsed and validated data that you don't have to test that property again. The validate approach does not provide this guarantee, because you cannot guarantee that `use` is never called without first running the validation. There is no information in the program itself saying that `use` must be called after validation (and that validation must return true). Whereas a version of `use` expecting NonEmpty cannot be called without at least validating that particular property.",

Rails had an excellent story for validating models which formed the basis for everything that followed, even in languages with static types - ASP.NET MVC was an attempt to win Rails programmers back without feeling too enterprisey. So you had these very convenient, very frameworky solutions that maybe looked like you were leaning on the type system but really it was all just reflection. That became the standard in every language, and nobody needed to remember “parse don’t validate” because heavy frameworks did the work. And why not? Very few error or result types in fancy typed languages are actually suited for showing multiple (internationalised) validation errors on a web page.The bitter lesson of programming languages is that whatever clever, fast, safe, low-level features a language has, someone will come along and create a more productive framework in a much worse language.Note, this framework - perhaps the very last one - is now ‘AI’.",

Some other code, locally or on a server you're reading a response from, broke something and forgot to set the age field.It's not just Rust that gets this (in my opinion) right, Kotlin and Swift also do this well at both a language and serialization library (kotlinx-serialization and Codable) level, but this quote from this article comparing Go and Rust is generally how I think about it:> If you’re looking to reduce the whole discourse to “X vs Y”, let it be “serde vs crossing your fingers and hoping user input is well-formed”. It is one of the better reductions of the problem: it really is “specifying behavior that should be allowed (and rejecting everything else)” vs “manually checking that everything is fine in a thousand tiny steps”, which inevitably results in missed combinations because the human brain is not designed to hold graphs that big.https://fasterthanli.me/articles/i-want-off-mr-golangs-wild-...Basically, if you do not want it to be wrapped in Option then you should either:1. explicitly specify a default—which can, but doesn't have to be 0.2. fail immediately (as this article explains) when trying to parse some data that does not have that field set.and if you do want an Option, you just need to be explicit about that.",

Some people believe there's a free ride to be had with them - drink Diet Coke and nothing happens, but I'm not so sure that's the case.If a sugary drink causes an insulin response, and perhaps that response is different of course, but if it causes an insulin response, and so do \"sugar-free\" drinks - we seem to be in a world where a large number of people are still dealing with issues related to sugar that they maybe aren't expecting. I just have a hard time believe there's a free ride with \"sugar-free\" drinks. This response probably leads to more cravings for so-called empty calories. A lot of people I find viscously defend \"sugar-free\" drinks which leads me to suspect there's something there too.If you grow up with an awful diet, like I did, not centered around so-called whole foods and actual cooking I think you wind up in a vicious cycle of sugar, sugar substitutes, and other empty-calorie style foods that all feed the same biological addiction mechanism.

The third thing is that pharmaceutical industry has learned how to hit multiple targets with a single drug - previously most drugs were formulated to hit at most one or two receptors, and now we're seeing work on quad or 5-way drugs.I'm super optimistic, the pipeline for future medications in these classes and other related ones are enormous.

That there would be a designated person to carry insurance and licensing and be personally responsible and personally answer to criminal or civil charges if \"their\" vehicle got in a fix.Honestly this model doesn't make any sense, as Waymo has set it up so that the only driver is the Waymo Driver making decisions, because the Waymo Driver is the only one who's privy to 100% the real-time data.The remote CSRs, whether they're in Philippines or stateside engineers on an escalation, are explicitly not driving the car but giving it suggestions.

It's so infrequent you wouldn't believe. Nearly all rides are performed fully autonomously without human intervention. But \"often\" sure sounds spicy!2) \"its autopilot is just guys from the Philippines\": no, it's not. A human is in the loop to help hint to the Waymo Driver AI platform what action to take if its confidence level is too low or it's facing a particularly odd edge case where it needs to be nudged to take an alternate route. This framing makes it sound like some dude in Manilla is remote controlling the car. They're not. They're issuing hints to and confirming choices by the Waymo Driver which remains in full control of the vehicle at all times.Because lay people, even non-technically-sophisticated lay people naturally start wondering \"well, isn't there some delay between a person in the Philippines and the car in the US? how could that be safe? what if the internet dips out or the connection drops?\" Which are good and valid points! And why this framing is so obnoxious and lazy. The car is always driving itself.They finally issued a correction in the linked article that makes it clear they're not remote controlling the cars, but the headline is still really slanted and a frustrating framing.

I installed the OS and everything was fine, but to my surprise..... wine was not installed by default (I'm not familiar with wine environment, i just got that impression because the terminal didn't recognize the wine command when i typed it manually).I get that the distribution is geared towards steam+proton usage, but I was disoriented to see that one creates \"an operating system for gamers\", which will most certainly run a lot of windows executables, and then won't include wine in it. There is lutris preinstalled and the documentation also hints towards installing winezgui from their appstore (which is what I did), but I wonder why wasn't that obvious for the developers of bazzite that after installing the system, user would just want to download a game, double click the executable and play.On the other hand, wine tends to be quite heavy package (503MB installed size according to arch repo), perhaps that's the reason for not including it.",

I guess it was just fun to see how hard it'd be to get HL2 content running.A bit similar to the OpenMW project working on Oblivion and Skyrim content loading on the side, though perhaps that's a more obvious future vector for that project.",

I did a lot of prompting and guidance through some of the benchmarking and tools that I expected it to use to get the result that I was looking for.Most of the plans that it generated were outside of my wheelhouse and not something I'm particularly familiar with, but I know it well enough to understand that its plan roughly made sense to me and I just let it go.

Models load pretty quickly.There's a distinction between tokens per second and time to first token.Delays come for me when I have to load a new model, or if I'm swapping in a particularly large context.Most of the time, since the model is already loaded, and I'm starting with a small context that builds over time, tokens per second is the biggest impactor.It's worth noting I don't do much fancy stuff, a tiny bit of agent stuff, I mainly use qwen-coder 30a3b or qwen2.5 code instruct/base 7b.I'm finding more complex agent stuff where multiple agents are used can really slow things down if they're swapping large contexts. ik_llama has prompt caching which help speed this up when swapping between agent contexts up until a point.tldr: loading weights each time isn't much of a problem, unless you're having to switch between models and contexts a lot, which modern agent stuff is starting to.",

But... It's time for me to check the new Qwen 0.6 transcription model. If it works as well as their benchmarks claim, that could be the target for very serious optimizations and a no deps inference chain conceived since the start for CPU execution, not just for MPS. Since, many times, you want to install such transcription systems on server rent online via Hetzner and other similar vendors.

The addition of the prompt parameter can also help with transcription quality, especially when using domain specific vocabulary. In general Whisper.cpp is better with transcribing full phrases than with streaming.And not to forget, for many use cases more than just English is needed. Unfortunately right now most STT/ASR and TTS focus on English plus 0-10 other languages. Thus being able to add with reasonable effort more languages or domain specific vocabulary would be a huge plus for any STT and TTS.",

The whole thing is a security nightmare.People are setting agents up, giving them access to secrets, payment details, keys to the kingdom. Then they hook them to the internet, plugging in services and tools, with no vetting or accountability. And since that is not enough, now the put them in roleplaying sandbox, because that's what this is, and let them run wild.Prompt injections are hilariously simple. I'd say the most difficult part is to find a target that can actually deliver some value. Moltbook largely solved this problem, because these agents are relatively likely to have access to valuable things, and now you can hit many of them, at the same time.I won't even go into how wasteful this whole, social media for agents, thing is.In general, bots writing each other on mock reddit, isn't something the loose sleep over. The moment agents start sharing their embeddings, not just generated tokens online, that's the point when we should consider worrying.",

Most of the supporting evidence is quotes from various people working at AI agent companies, explaining that AI agents are not something we need to worry about.  Of course, cigarette companies told us we didn't need to worry about cigarettes either.My view is that this entire discussion around \"pattern-matching\", \"mimicking\", \"emergence\", \"hallucination\", etc. is essentially a red herring.  If I \"mimic\" a racecar driver, \"hallucinate\" a racetrack, and \"pattern-match\" to an actual race by flooring the gas on my car and zooming along at 200mph... the outcome will still be the same if my vehicle crashes.For these AIs, the \"motivation\" or \"intent\" doesn't matter.

There were several thousand registrations, then over a few hours there were hundreds of thousands of sign-ups and a jump to 1M posts. Then if you looked at those posts they all came from the same set of users. Then a user admitted to hacking the database and inserting 1000s of users and 100ks of posts.Additionally, the API keys for all the users were leaked, so anyone could have automated posting on the site using any of those keys.Basically, there were so many ways for humans to either post manually or automatically post on Moltbook.

          "content": "> UI and user ergonomics continues to be Zulip's biggest blocker to wider adoption [...] many people who got turned away by its design or uses it in a Slack/Discord way by posting everything into \"general chat\"Having thought about this a bit, I propose there is an underlying dichotomy between \"completers\" and \"cultivators\"## CompletersPrioritize \"velocity\" and closing open loops. Limiting context means that they can act with focus. Close tabs often. Communication appends to the task queue; each conversation is an open ticket to be closed. Anything that scrolls off screen is implicitly marked as done. The ephemerality of the stream allows them to \"process\" a conversation and move on. Zulip might cause anxiety because threads/discussions linger without closure.## CultivatorsCommunication as externalized cognition. Messages are nuggets to be filed / incorporated into a larger schema. Wants a \"dashboard\" to maintain sense of control; fears something falling through the cracks more than they fear clutter. Don't care to \"finish\" a chat; want to keep the context organized and accessible for deep work / future decisions.## ProblemsZulip defaults to assuming that all chat is valuable and taxes every interaction with a little bit of up front effort. Slack assumes most chat is of ephemeral value and doesn't see the point of taxing 90% of the interactions for the 10% that might be valuable. Slack forces cultivators to become completers and Zulip nudges completors to act as cultivators.Completers preferring who prefers Slack/Discord/etc are implicitly adopting the the fragmentation of multi-system setup -- chat for ephemeral communication, and anything longer term must move to docs/wikis/Jira/whatever (which now begs for dozens of \"integrations\"). Understanding the state of anything now requires forensic archeology. (cue [Charlie Pepe Silvia meme]) Complicated acrobatics in channel names such as `#team-proj-blah` are attempts at combating the fundamental entropy of treating everything ephemeral.The challenge is that, ultimately organizing is also real work and ignoring it in a short-sighted drive for efficiency hinders longer term effectiveness.## Potential solutions?1. The chat platform could offer two different views: a triage flavored mode for completers, and a dashboard flavored mode for cultivators. Even one person could toggle back-and-forth between the two as necessary.2. Better UX for organizing incrementally, eg. UX improvements for manual clustering, and AI-assisted clustering / topic naming. Wouldn't it be great if people could continue chatting in the stream but the same message would simultaneously get filed under a topic? Technology might now enable such a product experience.3. Slack needs to stop pretending that search is an effective replacement for organization (esp when search is crappy). I haven't used Slack in a while (preferring Zulip with catchall topics as a good balance) but I get the impression that Slack [Canvas](https://slack.com/intl/en-in/features/canvas) is an attempt to combat this problem.----[Charlie Pepe Silvia meme] https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/pepe-silvia",

It is not a true forum like PHP forums, where we ask people to name threads, and you might just skip reading more than the title, or locate interesting threads by activity and find stickies about important announcements in a pull, not push, way of doing things.It instead is a chat where a thousand group chats are open, and no once wants to read any of them.If they wanted to re-invent forums, they should have cloned the \"discourse\" web app/forum.

The basic problem is that the mobile app is, like it or not, the way most people will use the product, and it needs to be designed by an opinionated person who actually will say no to things.In my view, the home page should be just like a proper messaging app: show every recent thread (\"topic\" in Zulip nomenclature) that I'm involved in, across all my channels, with unread ones indicated using a 'dot'. Or, if you really want to be like Slack, just copy Slack more directly. In either case, the other views (Inbox, Combined Feed, DMs, etc) should be under menus, not primary actions.The other thing is that it's often hard to figure out how to reply to a topic. In the Combined Feed, which is my preferred view for consuming updates, the UX for replying sucks -- first you have to figure out to tap the headers; and even then, you can accidentally tap into a channel instead of a topic. It's extremely non obvious when you've done this and constantly causes people to reply in the wrong topic.I vibecoded some improved Inbox UX using Claude Code and I think it would be a big step up, but it's hard to know what the steps would be to get it shipped, since I don't have time to spin up properly on the codebase and I doubt my changes are acceptable as-is. If Zulip team wants them I'd happily share though.",

I've run into a lot of cases when targeting C as a compilation target where swapping something out into an always-inline function results in worse code generation, because compilers have bugs sadlyThere's also the issue in that the following two things don't have the same semantics in C:    float v = a * b + c;\n\nvs    static_inline float get_thing(float a, float b) {\n        return a*b;\n    }\n\n    float v = get_thing(a, b) + c;\n\nThis is just a C-ism (floating point contraction) that can make extracting things into always inlined functions still be a big net performance negative. The C spec mandates it sadly!uintptr_t's don't actually have the same semantics as pointers either. Eg if you write:    void my_func(strong_type1* a, strong_type2* b);\n\na =/= b, and we can pull the underlying type out. However, if you write:    void my_func(some_type_that_has_a_uintptr_t1 ap, some_type_that_has_a_uintptr_t2 bp) {\n        float* a = get(ap);\n        float* b = get(bp);\n    }\n\na could equal b. Semantically the uintptr_t version doesn't provide any aliasing semantics. Which may or may not be what you want depending on your higher level language semantics, but its worth keeping the distinction in mind because the compiler won't be able to optimise as well",

C作为后端语言真正的痛点在于垃圾回收。最优的GC方案需要与常规栈帧深度结合，使得普通栈遍历程序能同时提供精确GC所需的所有信息（这是任何移动式GC设计的前提，即使更简单的分代收集器可以不依赖于此）。若需要实现跨平台且较快的精确栈扫描，目前最稳妥的方案是维护影子栈——在调用时传递前帧指针，该指针指向扁平数组末端，数组头部包含标识指针和前序帧指针（形成链式结构..."

It has inferred static typing, specialising functions based on type, reminiscent of how Javascript JIT compilers do it. Then the type inference engine was expanded to also specialise functions based on ownership/borrowing type of its arguments. RC is still done for variables that don't fit into the ownership system but the executed ops overall got greatly reduced. The trade-off is increased code size.I have read a few older papers about eliding reference counting ops which seem to be resulting in similar elisions, except that those had not been expressed in terms of ownership/borrowing.I think newer versions of the Swift compiler too infer lifetimes to some extent.When emitting Rust you could now also use reference counting smart pointers, even with cycle detection [1].\nPersonally I'm interested in how ownership information could be used to optimise tracing GC.[0]:https://aardappel.github.io/lobster/memory_management.html[1]:https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/Breadth-first-Cycle-Co...",
