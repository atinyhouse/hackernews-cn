      "abstract": "该讨论围绕漫画家斯科特·亚当斯去世的消息展开，社区成员主要回顾其代表作《呆伯特》及其个人思想的影响。许多用户表达了对《呆伯特》的怀念，认为该漫画以犀利幽默揭示了企业管理的荒谬，对读者理解职场文化、系统思维和习惯养成具有启蒙作用。有人指出，亚当斯提出的“复合技能”概念——即通过结合中等水平的写作、绘画与商业洞察力创造独特价值——给人留下深刻印象。\n\n讨论中也存在分歧：部分用户强调其后期作品质量下降，认为其讽刺脱离当代职场现实；另有用户提及亚当斯曾陷入争议观点，但本次讨论中多数人选择聚焦其早期贡献。普遍共识是，尽管对其个人言论评价不一，但《呆伯特》在幽默中传递的职场洞察力影响了一代读者，其文化遗产值得认可。",

          "content": "Scott Adams died today. I want to acknowledge something complicated.He always felt culturally like family to me. His peaks—the biting humor about corporate absurdity, the writing on systems thinking and compounding habits, the clarity about the gap between what organizations say and what they do—unquestionably made me healthier, happier, and wealthier. If you worked in tech in the 90s and 2000s, Dilbert was a shared language for everything broken about corporate life.His views, always unapologetic, became more strident over time and pushed everyone away. That also felt like family.You don’t choose family, and you don’t get to edit out the parts that shaped you before you understood what was happening. The racism and the provocations were always there, maybe, just quieter. The 2023 comments that ended Dilbert’s newspaper run were unambiguous.For Scott, like family, I’m a better person for the contribution. I hope I can represent the good things: the humor, the clarity of thought, the compounding good habits with health and money. I can avoid the ugliness—the racism, the grievance, the need to be right at any cost.Taking inventory is harder than eulogizing or denouncing. But it’s more honest.",

I don't know why I liked it so much when half the jokes went over my head, but I loved computers and comics, and I plowed through every book at my local library. It was my real introduction to software engineering, and it definitely influenced me in many ways that certainly shaped the man that I am today.I never agreed with him politically, and I honestly think he said some pretty awful stuff. However, none of that changes the positive impact that his comics had on my life. Rest in peace.",

At some point I got one of the compilation books and for some reason in an epilogue Adams included his alternate theory of gravity which was essentially that gravity as force didn't exist and things pressed down on each other because everything was expanding at the same rate. He said he had yet to find anyone who could refute this.Even at 12 I could tell this guy was an annoying idiot. Loved the comic though.",

He came from an office life in the late 90s and had a lot of insight into it's dysfunctions. But after decades of being out of that world, he had clearly lost touch. The comics often do little to speak to the current corporate world, outside of squeezed in references.As I see it, decline in quality and the political radicalization go hand in hand. You cannot be a good satirist and be so long removed from the world you are satirizing.",

One day my site traffic logs showed an unexpected uptick in traffic, and recent referrals overwhelmingly pointed to his blog. Of course I recognized him from Dilbert fame, both the comic strip and The Dilbert Principle.I sent him a thank you email for the link, and he replied graciously. This began a conversation where he referred me to his literary agent, and this ultimately led to a real-world, dead-tree-and-ink book publishing deal[1]. He even provided a nice blurb for the book cover.I can't say that I agreed a lot with the person Scott Adams later became--I only knew him vaguely, from a distance. But he brought humor into many people's lives for a lot of years, and he was generous to me when he didn't have to be. Today I'll just think about the good times.[1] https://www.damninteresting.com/the-damn-interesting-book/Edit: I found the relevant Dilbert Blog link via the Wayback Machine: https://web.archive.org/web/20071011024008/http://dilbertblo...",

Surely if I just engage him at his level without being a jackass, we can add some levity to the comments section.\" My instinct was that maybe he really was just a jackass and I should label him as such in my brain and move on.But then my cat got sick last year and went from being a cuddly little guy to an absolute viscious bastard right up to the day he died. It was crushing. One day I realized it felt similar to my experience with Scott. I wondered if maybe Scott was just suffering really badly, too. I have no idea what the truth of the matter is, and I don't think that people who suffer have a free pass for their behaviour. But I think I want to hold on to this optimism.",

And that was it, that was the entire comic.

As he closed in on his master’s degree, he learned that an assistant vice president position was opening up but figured he wouldn’t get it because the bank was leaning toward hiring a minority, he said.Adams jumped to Pacific Bell and completed his degree, thinking he was on the fast track to upper management. But in his book, Adams wrote that as was the case at Crocker National, his new employer was also coming under fire for a lack of diversity in its executive ranks.Instead of getting mad, Adams got to drawing. Believing all this was a sign for him to revive his dream of cartooning, he purchased a primer on how to submit a comic strip and went about creating Dilbert.https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/general-news/scott-ad...",

One example was his assertion that Donald Trump was a \"master persuader\", and much more skilled in his speech then people were giving him credit for. I remember, at the time at least, that he always prefaced it by saying it wasn't in support/antagonism of Trump, just an observation of his skill, but it quickly got turned into \"Scott Adams is a MAGA guy.\" (Since then, I don't know if Adams ever became a MAGA guy or not, but it's an example of how at the time his statements got oversimplified and distorted). Anyway, I saw a lot of examples of that -- he'd have a relatively nuanced take probably expressed too boldly, but people wanted to just lump him in to some narrative they already had going.I think Scott Adams' biggest problem in life (although partially what also made him entertaining), is that he'd kind of pick fights that had little upside for him and a lot of downside.",

Because an x.0 release inevitably has issues, it offers less than a year of stability (sometimes only a few months if it takes until x.4 to be fully stable) before things get broken again in y.0. And because Apple stops signing old versions pretty quickly, you’re often stuck on an unstable new version if you take the risk and upgrade.Additionally, it is hard on all developers (Apple included) to release updates for all of its many platforms on the same day, which IMO reduces software quality across the ecosystem.(Apple also has the luxury of only supporting the latest OS versions with its software. Customers often expect third-party developers to support a wider range of OS versions and devices than Apple does.)",

I worked closely with Bas Ording, Stephen Lemay, Marcel van Os, Imran Chaudry, Don Lindsey and Greg Christie. I have no experience with any of the designers who arrived in the post-Steve era. During my time, Jony Ive didn't figure prominently in the UI design, although echoes of his industrial design appeared in various ways in the graphic design of the widgets. Kevin Tiene and Scott Forstall had more influence for better or worse, extreme skeumorphism for example.The UX group would present work to Steve J. every Thursday and Steve quickly passed judgement often harshly and without a lot of feedback, leading to even longer meetings afterward to try and determine course corrections. Steve J. and Bas were on the same wavelength and a lot of what Bas would show had been worked on directly with Steve before hand. Other things would be presented for the first time, and Steve could be pretty harsh. Don, Greg, Scott, Kevin would push back and get abused, but they took the abuse and could make in-roads.Here is my snapshot of Stephen from the time. He presented the UI ideas for the intial tabbed window interface in Safari. He had multiple design ideas and Steve dismissed them quickly and harshly. Me recollection was that Steve said something like No, next, worse, next, even worse, next, no. Why don't you come back next week with something better. Stephen didn't push back, say much, just went ok and that was that. I think Greg was the team manager at the time and pushed Steve for more input and maybe got some. This was my general observation of how Stephen was over 20 years ago.I am skeptical and doubtful about Stephen's ability to make a change unless he is facilitated greatly by someone else or has somehow changed drastically. The fact that he has been on the team while the general opinion of Apple UX quality has degraded to the current point of the Tahoe disaster is telling. Several team members paid dearly in emotional abuse under Steve and decided to leave rather than deal with the environment post Steve's death. Stephen is a SJ-era original and should have been able to push hard against what many of us perceive as very poor decisons. He either agreed with those decisions, or did not, and choose to go with the flow and enjoy the benefits of working at Apple. This is fine I guess. Many people are just fine going with the flow and not rocking the boat. It may be even easier when you have Apple-level comp and benefits.My opinon; unless Stephen gets a very strong push from other forces, I don't see that he has the will or fortitude to make the changes that he himself has approved in one way or another. Who will push him? Tim Cook, Craig Federighi, Eddy Cue, Phil Schiller? The perceived mess of Tahoe happened on the watch of all of these Apple leaders.",

I hit install, they added a new grouping feature to Reminders and that is about all I use from what they added.Still bitter that my 2006 Core Duo MacBook only had support up to 10.6 Snow Leopard but back then that was over 4 years of being able to use the latest OS, so comparable to four releases with the current cycles.",

And when you switch, you start noticing all those others features you never noticed before, because they are now gone. Some of these features will be hardware, some OS, some application support, and some of them you can fix and some you just have to get used to.An approach I recommend is to add a linux laptop to the mix. You can buy a used, powerful laptop cheap, install Linux on it and try to use it for a time, keeping your other machines around. Chances are you'll find various trade-offs - Linux will NOT be a strict improvement, it will have downsides. Linux is particularly weak with power management and certain devices like fingerprint readers. Depending on the apps you use, it can be weak there, too. That said, Linux is very usable, easy to install, and you should try it. But I think it does people a disservice to imply its better on every axis. It's better on some, worse on others.",

Everything from being able to clearly distinguish UI elements, to general accessibility, to discoverability, everything got worse.Operating Systems are one of the most complicated systems we created, not because they're a collection of processes and thread, but because everything is built on top of them and creating something that's well thought out and stable, and intuitive is really hard. Designers just randomly creating visual elements just because it looks cool and not paying attention how people are going to use it is simply half assing the whole thing.That's still one of the reasons I believe Alan Dye was let go, fired in a sense, he had power over the company, but with that power he screwed things so much that we need to rediscover all the things related to usability in very high detail as if we're rediscovering the wheel, just so that we can get back to square one.",

If you actually spend time using classic MacOS and Aqua these days, man is it frustrating to get basic things done. Everything is so slow and you're constantly resizing windows to see whats in them. I own several Macs from the 80s-00s and they are really in need of many quality of life updates that later MacOS revs added.

GNOME has a tendency of forcing UIs on users, and Ubuntu with Unity, now GNOME again, etc. Though, thankfully, since the user is free to choose their own desktop environment and window manager, it's not as pressing of an issue.I realized many years ago that simpler UIs deliver the best UX. This is a large reason why I love the command line so much. Most programs have a fixed and stable interface, and can be composed to do what I want. For graphical programs I prefer using a simple window manager like bspwm on X, and niri on Wayland. These don't draw window decorations, and are primarily keyboard-driven, so I don't need superfluous graphics. I only need a simple status bar that shows my workspaces, active window, and some system information. I recently configured it with Quickshell[1], and couldn't be happier. I plan to use this setup for years to come, and it gives me great peace of mind knowing that no company can take that away from me. I will have to maintain it myself, but there shouldn't be any changes in the programs I use to break this in a major way.[1]: https://github.com/imiric/quickshell-niri/tree/main/fancy-ba...",

So why did they assume that the abusive situation would continue? Jobs was generally known to be harsh to the point of abusive, but if the situation did not change on his death maybe the abuse was equal parts cultural rather than just from the CEO, so why not leave earlier?",

I'm hitting my mid-40s and decided it was time for a drastic change. I could have continued yo-yo dieting or opt for a solution that gets me to a healthy BMI within a year.I gained a lot of weight during puberty, coupled with a less healthy diet in my youth. I  suspect many folks are in the same boat - by the time they realize they need to eat/exercise, it's too late. Their metabolic system has been compromised by either diet, hormones, genetics, whatever.In four months on a GLP-1, I've dropped about 18kg and since I coupled resistance training, I've increased on various strength parameters. The sudden reduction in weight has benefited my activity level substantially. There tends to be two classes of folks - those who need to stay on this drug forever and those who don't - I'm hoping in the end I fall into the don't, but I'm going to let the data from my continuous glucose monitor decide that.I highly recommend the book \"Ozempic Revolution\" if you're considering the pros/cons of this path.",

Weight loss for most definitely tails off, but doesn't completely stop if you continue longer than the 18mo SURMOUNT-4[0] study went for with Tirzepatide.I also do not know if this was patients going on maintenance dosing, staying the same, or ramping up doses to the full 15mg max dose.  Would need to re-read it as it's been some time.fwiw Tirzepatide is actually around 25% average loss vs. 20%. My anecdotal evidence from my peer group shows that the vast majority can go further than 25% (if needed) and then maintain it - but that does require significant lifestyle changes to maintain. The few who simply kept eating junk but less of it had far less drastic results.I do consider it a performance enhancing drug for dieting due to that fact. Those that use it as one tool of many seem to do incredibly well. Those that use it as the only tool have much worse outcomes. No surprises there, but it was surprising to me how durable so far those who decided to make life changes have stuck with it now over the course of around 3+ years.My random guess would be that if you use it to break habits and establish new ones, you tend to become a super responder. I like to tell people it was perhaps roughly 60% of my weight loss (36% or so, but I tapered off due to hitting my goal) was due to the drug, 40% due to other factors like eating better and creating new workout habits. The drug simply made it much easier than previous attempts at dieting, and the results turned into a feedback loop.Another pet theory of mine is that if you use it to break a food addiction, you end up being able to stay on the wagon easier. This is based on other life experiences with other substances - the longer you stay off, the easier it becomes (for most) to abstain. Especially if you create new habits in their place. I no longer crave those late night taco bell runs like I once did even when (mostly) off the drug itself.[0] https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38078870/",

In a very abstract way, it's the same as buying amphetamines to lose weight, just with a different (arguably smaller) set of side effects.Also, I can't find the comparison in the study to spending by non-Ozempic households.

The highest decrease of 10% for savory snacks is also modest at most (e.g. still consuming 9 pack instead of 10 in a reference period. having nothing good to watch on TV might have higher effect).The data might really be useful for the food industry once, but only after the usage of the medicine goes beyond 16% currently. 5-8% change, even 10%, for 16% of the population is tiny.To me the study sounds desperate to project significance, using adjectives rather than data for seeking attention.",

If everyone started eating the right amount overnight, grocery spend would drop 10-20%.But since it's 16% on these drugs, and figure since they are Losing Weight (not maintaining), safe to say those 16% of Americans are eating 20-30% less... 20-30% times 16% = 3-5% decrease in spend.So it tracks, roughly.

It avoids tying them directly to internalised beliefs in their own AI model, it avoids all the capex around building out an AI engine and associated DC, it reduces risk, and it keeps google in a relationship under contract which google will value, and probably value enough to think hard about stupid legal games regarding Playstore and walled gardens.Apple plainly doesn't believe in the uplift and impending AGI doom. Nor do they believe there's no value in AI services. They just think for NOW at least they can buy in better than they can own.But based on Apples VLSI longterm vision, on their other behaviours in times past with IPR in any space, they will ultimately take ownership.",

The first issue is that there is significant momentum in calling Siri bad, so even if Apple released a higher quality version it will still be labelled bad. It can enhance the user's life and make their device easier to use, but the overall press will be cherrypicked examples where it did something silly.2. Basing Siri on Google's Gemini can help to alleviate some of that bad press, since a non-zero share of that doomer commentary comes from brand-loyalists and astroturfing.3. The final issue is that on-device Siri will never perform like server-based ChatGPT. So in a way it's already going to disappoint some users who don't realise that running something on mobile device hardware is going to have compromises which aren't present on a server farm.\nTo help illustrate that point: We even have the likes of John Gruber making stony-faced comparisons between Apple's on-device image generator toy (one that produces about an image per second) versus OpenAI's server farm-based image generator which makes a single image in about 1-2 minutes.

Probably 30% of the time I use claude code in the terminal it's not actually to write any code.For instance I use claude code to classify my expenses (given a bank statement CSV) for VAT reporting, and fill in the spreadsheet that my accountant sends me. Or for noting down line items for invoices and then generating those invoices at the end of the month. Or even booking a tennis court at a good time given which ones are available (some of the local ones are north/south facing which is a killer in the evening). All these tasks could be done at least as well outside the terminal, but the actual capability exists - and can only exist - on my computer alone.I hope this will interact well with CLAUDE.md and .claude/skills and so forth. I have those files and skills scattered all over my filesystem, so I only have to write the background information for things once. I especially like having claude create CLIs and skills to use those CLIs. Now I only need to know what can be done, rather than how to do it - the “how” is now “ask Claude”.It would be nice to see Cowork support them! (Edit: I see that the article mentions you can use your existing 'connectors' - MCP servers I believe - and that it comes with some skills. I haven't got access yet so I can't say if it can also use my existing skills on my filesystem…)(Follow-up edit: it seems that while you can mount your whole filesystem and so forth in order to use your local skills, it uses a sandboxed shell, so your local commands (for example, tennis-club-cli) aren't available.

Claude really isn't able to understand details of images in the same way that people currently can - this is also explained well with an analysis of Claude Plays Pokemon https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/u6Lacc7wx4yYkBQ3r/insights-i.... I think over the next few years we'll probably see all major LLM companies work on resolving these weaknesses & then LLMs using UIs will work significantly better (and eventually get to proper video stream understanding as well - not 'take a screenshot every 500ms' and call that video understanding).",

I was quite impressed with Corridor Crew's (albeit NVidia+Puget-sponsored) video [1] where they photographed dolls, motion-captured human actors moving like the dolls, and transferred the skeletal animation and facial expressions to those dolls using GenAI. Some of it required nontrivial transformative code to accommodate a skeleton to a toy's body type. There's a massive amount of tedium being removed from the creative process by GenAI without sacrificing the core human creative contribution. This feels like it should be allowed -- I think we should attempt to draw clearer lines where there are clearly efficiency gains to be had to have less \"creative\" uses be more socially acceptable.[1]: https://youtu.be/DSRrSO7QhXY",

Or vice versa, an instrumental morphing into a voice.Finally is when the generation goes wrong and it starts spitting out absolute nonsensical sounds with no rhythm or melody, in a uniquely fragmented way I can't really describe.

          "content": "I think it would be very difficult for most people to tell that songs are generated by Suno 5. There are some interesting anomalies I can see in the spectrum and mid/side channels, like Suno music often has very little information in the side channel (what happens when you subtract the left and right channels from each other). You also commonly see the eq curve of the rhythm section shift over time throughout the song - like drums will sound normal at the beginning but end up sounding kind of under water by the end, but they are quickly improving these things. But to the layperson, many of these things are completely invisible. The most obvious tell, IMO, is the cadence of the lyrics.",

          "content_cn": "我认为大多数人很难分辨出歌曲是由Suno 5生成的。从频谱和中/侧声道中我能观察到一些有趣的异常现象，比如Suno生成的音乐通常在侧声道（即左右声道相减得到的部分）信息量极少。此外，歌曲中节奏部分的均衡曲线常常会随时间推移发生变化——例如鼓声在开头听起来正常，但到结尾时却像在水下一样发闷，不过他们正在快速改进这些问题。但对普通人来说，这些细节大多完全无法察觉。在我看来，最明显的破绽在于歌词的韵律节奏。"

I mean I get what it means, but I don't think it describes why people enjoy art.To me, it seems more like people place their own meaning in art. A particular song might remind one individual of the good times they had in their teens, while the actual meaning of the song is completely different.Bachs 5th symphony (or whatever) might be extremely annoying to someone because they had to listen to it every day at work.And what exactly is the meaning of jazz fusion? I really like a good solo, but a lot of people hate it, they need to hear a voice. (though I don't particularly like the signature Suno or Udio solo..)I found this ai track on Spotify that I unironically enjoyed. I listened to it every day while working on reviving an old passion project, which became its meaning to me. The tune, a long with its album with random disparate suno generations was taken down.I'm not sure if I have a point here, but something is off with the story thing in art to me from a consumers point of view. Maybe from other artists as consumers point of view?",

          "content": "Unless Apple gets off several high horses regarding code signing and, more importantly, app containerization; any Xcode for iPadOS is going to be useless. Like, imagine Xcode without custom build steps or third-party compilers.The larger problem is that the iPad has a dual nature. At the launch of the product, Apple positioned it as a netbook killer - i.e. a simplified computer for specific tasks, one where the locked down nature of the device might actually be considered a feature. That's why they built everything on iPhone OS[0]. However, there's always been the implication that this is supposed to Someday™ replace the Mac. It keeps getting new features to make it more useful as a computer replacement, which just makes the deliberate restrictions placed on the device more and more glaring. And Apple seems to think they can just keep adding features until they can make you do every computing task wearing a strait-jacket in a padded room.This particular duality came to a head with the Apple Vision Pro. Any app that would actually be useful on a VR headset is either:- Incompatible with Apple's code-signing and containerization requirements (i.e. developer tools)- Not economic to offer at the small scale of the visionOS app market (at least, not while Apple is demanding 30%)- A game (Apple really doesn't wanna talk about the Vision Pro as a games machine)On a related note, Swift Playgrounds stopped getting updates almost a year ago. I updated my HTML editor demo project for iPadOS 26 and now I can't even compile it because Apple has yet to ship the version 26 SDK. And there's really nothing any third party can do to fix Swift Playgrounds to make it actually usable again.[0] Strictly speaking, Apple's first internal demos of capacitive touch were for a tablet project specifically to spite Windows XP tablets. Although by the time they were writing actual shipping code it was intended for iPhone and iPad came later.",

From day 1, Logic challenged itself \"what if we can use the same event-based data model to render both.\"None of this complexity is hidden - you can edit the raw event stream directly. If you're a developer familiar with, say, React, it makes music creation quite intuitive - everything from visual to audio output is a function of a transparently formatted data store.And while that has its challenges, and some of the UX innovations of e.g. MuseScore have been slower to arrive in Logic, because of this \"dual life\" it's unmatched as a pedogogical tool, and a professional creative tool as well.",

So for example, the user can create a set of notes in the pianoroll that will never be played correctly by anyone reading the score; the user can create dynamics in the score that cannot be correctly presented in the pianoroll version.I'm not saying it isn't possible to do an MVC-style system with two different views of the same data model - it clearly is.

Now I get it that some folks(dads on the spectrum?) might feel their best contribution to their child's development stems from something they build in the lab but your children are only young for such a short period and taking time away from them to build a custom electronic solution seems narrowminded and selfish.",

Most homes I see with panels on the roof are two story homes where you have a negligible amount of area to work with relative to interior space. There was a point where you'd have to deal with a door-to-door salesman approximately every 48h for an entire summer.The most realistic residential installation I've seen was firmly on the ground at a ~2 acre property. The panels were much larger and heavier (i.e., capable) than what you'd typically find on a roof. It's much easier to build and maintain a solar array when you don't need a ladder/crane to move things around.I think that it's great that we want to participate in making things better, but not every situation makes sense. When you factor in all of the downstream consequences of sub-optimal, fly-by-night installs, it starts to look like a net negative on the environment. I'm not trying to claim that all rooftop solar projects are bad, but most of the residential ones I've seen make absolutely zero economic sense.Large scale wind and solar projects are the best way forward. You get so much more bang for buck. I'd consider investing in these projects or their upstream suppliers and owners if you want to get involved financially in making the environment a better place.",

At the same time, manufacturing cost is dropping as well.Some battery makers are producing batteries at a cost level of around 60$ per kwh. At that cost, the 16kwh battery would come out below 1000$ (not the same obviously as the product price). Sodium ion might push those prices even lower. Below 50$ soonish and eventually closer to the 10-20$ range in maybe 5-10 years. At that point we're talking a few hundred dollars for a decent size domestic battery. You still need packaging, inverters, etc. of course.But the ROI at anything close to those price levels is going to be pretty rapid. And it wouldn't break the bank for households across the world. Add a few kw of solar on roofs, balconies, etc. It won't solve everyone's problems and certainly not in every season. But it can help reduce energy bills in a meaningful enough way. Even in winter.Also worth pointing out: most of the US is south of Cornwall. The Canadian border runs roughly at 49 degrees latitude. Cornwall is the most southern point in the UK sits at 50 degrees. If it can work there, most of the US has no excuse. Also, the UK isn't exactly well known for their clear blue skies.

Nevertheless, based on my one month of data, it looks like we can generate all the power we need for our household on a sunny winter day, excluding electric vehicles. Even on overcast days, we can sometimes offset a significant portion of our usage. My locale does not have time-of-use rates, so there’s no point trying to do arbitrage for electricity prices. So right now I just have our battery configured for backup. My hope is that during the summer months I can reconfigure the system to use the battery to reduce grid reliance instead.The expiring tax credits were what forced my hand. I’m the kind of person who likes to install things himself, and I probably would have gone that route for solar too, because the materials costs (sans battery) aren’t even half of the total cost.",

Dinky RS485 serial → USB converter needs a 120ohm resistor between pins for line termination. Growatt meter port expects a SDM630 meter, not a DTSU666 (hardcoded), so vibe code another emulator. DIP switches for RS232 connection need to be both on the ON position (undocumented). CH340 USB→serial converter for RS232 does not work, but one with a Prolific chip does. Etc. etc. etc :)Oh, and the biggest one... I was expecting to be able to just send a command, 'charge at 500watts', now... 'discharge at 2000watts'. But no.

For a classical alpha-beta search based engine, for a given ply (turn) you might have ~20 moves to consider each depth of the search tree. If you're trying to brute force search deeper, a 10x increase in compute time or power doesn't even let you search an extra ply.Elo gains for engines tend to come from better evaluation, better pruning, and better search heuristics. That's not to say that longer search time or a stronger CPU doesn't help, it just doesn't magically make a weak engine into a strong engine.",

Power has gravity, it always wants more. Ideally, there would be institutions that are democratically established and managed that would be trusted to safeguard the people's interests. In the US, there are executive department agencies for example like the FCC, FTC, FDA and more, but they are subject to those in power who are elected by the people.My \"food for thought\" here is that similar to supreme courts, there needs to be a regulatory and oversight branch of the government, whose chiefs are apolitical (like actually, not like the US supreme court), well compensated, long-tenured (but not lifetime, more like 20 years), and appointed by confirmation of all other branches of government.We need to address the problem of power, influence to wield power and incentives for those entrusted with power to act in good faith, but also with good competence.

There is no real incentive to do anything relevant to voters, in fact you have seen over the last five years that political engagement has dropped significantly in a way that has generally benefitted incumbents.To say this another way: the point of the UK system is so that people who are manifestly unfit to govern end up governing, and a small rotating group of special interests are continually pandered to (there is complete blindness to this in the UK, people often assume this is wealthy people when wealthy people are largely ignored...a politics grad working in research for a think tank will have more power in actual government than someone who gives £10m to the governing party).",

Thieves can make up to £300 (about $400) per device — more than triple the national minimum wage for a day’s work.\n\n  And they know they are unlikely to be caught.

That is it. Ex this impact and in relative terms, violent crime in cities has been increasing significantly. And violent crime is supposed to be the rare subset of crime when, obviously, other categories of crime are generally increasing.Btw, the group that publishes this data is also (strangely) unwilling to make this known and, afaik, do not include this information in press releases.The other factor is that the composition of London's population has naturally changed over the last ten years. As London has continued to dominate economically, the poor have been emptied out from certain areas contributing greatly to a reduction in crime stats (and, unfortunately, an increase elsewhere in the country). For example, Camden has seen a huge reduction in violent crime, is this a surprise? If you look at areas that have stayed the same, crime has got worse (again, in relative terms/ex the above factors, crime in the UK is falling in many areas and rising in others).I will say this another way: data is not collected fairly or accurately. There are massive political and financial incentives against accurate data. In London, this has always been the case because it is not possible to win elections in some areas in London with high crime if you admit that crime is high in those areas...you have to blame society. Twenty years ago, you had the same thing: city has never been safer, politicians doing so well, Met doing so well...once you have seen this a few times, you should start to wonder whether it is true...particularly as the current line is that crime was rampant twenty years ago...when it obviously wasn't.

I suspect that a frontier model today would have 50+TB of training data in the form of text alone - and that's several orders of magnitude more information and from a much more diverse point of view than what would have survived from that period.

William Clifford (who _died_ in 1889) had notions that foreshadowed general relativity: \"Riemann, and more specifically Clifford, conjectured that forces and matter might be local irregularities in the curvature of space, and in this they were strikingly prophetic, though for their pains they were dismissed at the time as visionaries.\" - Banesh Hoffmann (1973)Things don't happen all of a sudden, and being able to see all the scientific papers of the era its possible those could have fallen out of the synthesis.",

But training a model large enough to be useful is a major issue. Training a 700M parameter model at home is very doable (and is what this TimeCapsuleLLM is), but to get that kind of reasoning you need something closer to a 70B model. Also a lot of the \"smarts\" of a model gets injected in fine tuning and RL, but any of the available fine tuning datasets would obviously contaminate the model with 2026 knowledge.",

          "content": "It's only easy to see precursors in hindsight. The Michelson-Morley tale is a great example of this. In hindsight, their experiment was screaming relativity, because it demonstrated that the speed of light was identical from two perspectives where it's very difficult to explain without relativity. Lorentz contraction was just a completely ad-hoc proposal to maintain the assumptions of the time (luminiferous aether in particular) while also explaining the result. But in general it was not seen as that big of a deal.There's a very similar parallel with dark matter in modern times. We certainly have endless hints to the truth that will be evident in hindsight, but for now? We are mostly convinced that we know the truth, perform experiments to prove that, find nothing, shrug, adjust the model to be even more esoteric, and repeat onto the next one. And maybe one will eventually show something, or maybe we're on the wrong path altogether. This quote, from Michelson in 1894 (more than a decade before Einstein would come along), is extremely telling of the opinion at the time:\"While it is never safe to affirm that the future of Physical Science has no marvels in store even more astonishing than those of the past, it seems probable that most of the grand underlying principles have been firmly established and that further advances are to be sought chiefly in the rigorous application of these principles to all the phenomena which come under our notice. It is here that the science of measurement shows its importance — where quantitative work is more to be desired than qualitative work. An eminent physicist remarked that the future truths of physical science are to be looked for in the sixth place of decimals.\" - Michelson 1894",

The speculation is that such LLMs could help us look at correlational links accepted as truths and help us devise an alternative experimental path or craft arguments for such experiments.Imagine you have an LLM trained on papers up to some threshold, feed your manuscript with correlational evidence and have an LLM point out uncontrolled confounders or something like that.",

I don't use TikTok or OnlyFans and I don't find e-sports entertaining, but I have a hard time arguing that a screen actor, Victoria's Secret model, or soccer player should be worthy of a visa and a social media star, OnlyFans model, or a professional Counter Strike player shouldn't is not.

OF models who make a lot of money should totally qualify for this.Also this visa in uncapped so giving visas to OF models does not take away anything from scientists and others.O visa's original intent was to help pretty ladies from Eastern Europe to be brought into the country as indentured workers. That is why it is so easy to get this visa for an actor or a fashion model but very tough to get someone for their research.So all this is working as intended.",

Local restaurant reviews had a sense of responsibility and respectful conduct, but didn’t shy away from levity when the food stank. Far from a mere aggregate of gripes of the crankiest customers or sycophantic pablum, it was a the product of someone who’d honed their craft—taking pains to represent what was there according to a professional ethic.This amounts to a public record that’s a dependable source of historical truth in a way that a forum or social platform doesn’t approximate.They may not be as good today, but $200 a year is arguably worth the democracy protecting function alone.",

It’s an uneven impact of the technology shift from printing presses to digital. Why didn’t the drop in publishing costs make local journalism MORE accessible?Perhaps it did in minor ways. Facebook Groups, NextDoor, CraigsList, etc make it easy for anyone to share information with their neighbors. Turns out most people just want to sell something or complain about nothing. These activities benefit the author but nobody else.Local journalism has benefitted a little bit from this dynamic. Regional news organizations put together decent digital platforms and run articles. But they don’t seem to pay as well… again because the revenue spread out.Honestly, I’d love to treat local journalism as a public good. Could you fund a credible local newspaper through taxes? It’d be WAY cheaper than a school or police station.The problem is: how can you trust part of the government to keep an eye on the rest of the government?Perhaps you could impose a mandatory journalism fee based on the municipal budget. Whatever you spend, a sliver goes to the journalists for oversight.Local governments spend about $2700 per person. Population of 10,000 means a budget of $27M. Give 1% of that to a journalist and you have $270k… enough for a salary, website and some equipment.You could require that money be paid to a non-profit as a grant. Probably better to elect an Editor in Chief though… that way you can appeal directly to the citizens for validation of the oversight. If you just pay a non-profit, they’ll be incentivized to serve whoever writes the grant… which would be the people you’re trying to hold accountable.",

          "content": "Debugging from git history is a separate question from merge vs rebase. Debugging from history can be done with non-rebased merges, with rebased merges, and with squashed commits, without any noticeable difference. Pass `--first-parent` to git-log and git-bisect in the first two cases and it's virtually identical.My preference for rebasing comes from delivering stacked PRs: when you're working on a chain of individually reviewable changes, every commit is a clean, atomic, deliverable patch. git-format-patch works well with this model. GitHub is a pain to use this way but you can do it with some extra scripts and setting a custom \"base\" branch.The reason in that scenario to prefer rebasing over \"merging in master\" is that every merge from master into the head of your stack is a stake in the ground: you can't push changes to parent commits anymore. But the whole point of stacked diffs is that I want to be able to identify different issues while I work, which belong to different changes. I want to clean things up as I go, without bothering reviewers with irrelevant changes. \"Oh this README could use a rewrite; let me fix that and push it all the way up the chain into its own little commit,\" or \"Actually now that I'm here, let me update dependencies and ensure we're on latest before I apply my changes\". IME, an ideal PR is 90% refactors and \"prefactors\" which don't change semantics, all the way up to \"implemented functionality behind a feature flag\", and 10% actual changes which change the semantics. Having an editable history that you can \"keep bringing with you\" is indispensible.Debugging history isn't really related. Other than that this workflow allows you to create a history of very small, easily testable, easily reviewable, easily revertible commits, which makes debugging easier. But that's a downstream effect.",

The result is a clean, linear history that’s easier to review and bisect when tracking down bugs.The article discusses why contributors should rebase their feature branches (pull request).The reason they give is for clean git history on main.The more important reason is ensure the PR branch actually works if merged into current main. If I add my change onto main, does it then build, pass all tests, etc? What if my PR branch is old, and new commits have been added onto main that I don't have in my PR branch? Then I can merge and break main. That's why you need to update your PR branch to include the newer commits from main (and the \"update\" could be a rebase or a merge from main or possibly something else).The downside of requiring contributors to rebase their PR branch is (1) people are confused about rebase and (2) if your repository has many contributors and frequent merges into main, then contributors will need to frequently rebase their PR branch, and each rebase their PR checks need to re-run, which can be time consuming.My preference with Github is to squash merge into main[1] to keep clean git history on main. And to use merge queue[2], which effectively creates a temp branch of main+PR, runs your CI checks, and then the PR merge succeeds into main only if checks pass on the temp branch. This approach keeps super clean history on main, where every commit includes a specific PR number, and more importantly minimizes friction for contributors by reducing frequent PR rebases on large/busy repos. And it ensures main is never broken (as far as your CI checks can catch issues).

It’s easier.More to your point, there are times when blame on a line does not show the culprit. If you move code, or do anything else to that line, then you have to keep searching. Sometimes it’s easier to look at the entire patch history of a file. If there is a way to repeatedly/recursively blame on a line, that’s cool and I’d love to know about it.I now manage two junior engineers and I insist that they squash and rebase their work. I’ve seen what happens if they don’t. The merges get tangled and crazy, they include stuff from other branches they didn’t mean to, etc. the squash/rebase flow has been a way to make them responsible for what they put into the history, in a way that is simple enough that they got up to speed and own it.",

That makes it more clear that it's generally not acceptable to force push your rewritten history upstream. I've seen people trying to force push their changes and overwrite the remote history. If you need to force push, you probably messed up. Maybe OK on your own pull request branches assuming nobody else is working on them. But otherwise a bad idea.I tend to rebase my unpushed local changes on top of upstream changes. That's why rebase exists. So you can rewrite your changes on top of upstream changes and keep life simple for consumers of your changes when they get merged. It's a courtesy to them. When merging upstream changes gets complicated (lots of conflicts), falling back to merging gives you more flexibility to fix things.The resulting pull requests might get a bit ugly if you merge a lot. One solution is squash merging when you finally merge your pull request. This has as the downside that you lose a lot of history and context. The other solution is to just accept that not all change is linear and that there's nothing wrong with merging. I tend to bias to that.If your changes are substantial, conflict resolution caused by your changes tends to be a lot easier for others if they get lots of small commits, a few of which may conflict, rather than one enormous one that has lots of conflicts. That's a good reason to avoid squash merges. Interactive rebasing is something I find too tedious to bother with usually. But some people really like those. But that can be a good middle ground.It's not that one is better than the other. It's really about how you collaborate with others. These tools exist because in large OSS projects, like Linux, where they have to deal with a lot of contributions, they want to give contributors the tools they need to provide very clean, easy to merge contributions.

If you often have to write bespoke test scripts to run in bisect (e.g. because \"test for presence of bug\" is a process that involves restarting/orchestrating lots of services and/or debugging by interacting with a GUI), then you have to balance the time spent writing those with the time it'd take for you to figure out the causal commit by hand. If you're in a project where you're personally familiar with roughly what was released when, or where the release process/community is well-connected, it's often better to promote practices like \"ask in Slack/the mailing list whether anyone has made changes to ___ recently, whoever pipes up will help you debug\" rather than \"everyone should be really good at bisect\". Those aren't mutually exclusive, but they both do take work to install in a community and thus have an opportunity cost.This and many other perennial discussions about Git (including TFA) have a common cause: people assume that criticisms/recommendations for how to use Git as a release coordinator/member of a disconnected team of volunteers apply to people who use Git who are members of small, tightly-coupled teams of collaborators (e.g. working on closed-source software).",

The committer did the hard part, they wrote the story of changes in a logical, easy to parse manner.If the story is a mess, where the commits are huge or out of logical order, etc - then it doesn't matter much in my view.. the PR(s) sucks either way.I find stacked PRs to be a workflow solution to what to me is a UI problem.",

This appeals to frustrated people, more often men, who are struggling with emotional regulation and want a solution that feels like a tough response.Maybe there’s something useful in here, but more often than not when I see younger people I work with invoke stoicism it’s as a weak defensive mechanism to dodge their emotions for a while rather than deal with them. The modern simplified ideal of stoicism is just being too tough to care and flexing to show others that you don’t care.Anecdotally, I haven’t seen anyone embrace this social media version of stoicism and thrive on it long term. At best it’s just a phase that helps them get past something temporary, but at worst it’s a misleading ideal that leads them to bottling up and ignoring problems until they become too unbearable to ignore. Some times you do have to care and you have to address the root cause, not just listen to some influencers telling you to be so tough you don’t care like legions of warriors and prisoners in past literature.",

          "content": "I don't know how much the modern take on stoicism diverges from its historical origins, but I'm among those who believe that it ultimately pumps a delusion: that one can solve mind aches with mind hacks. Contemplative mystics (e.g. Zen, Dao) can recognize in stoicism some elemental truths --mainly that our emotions tend to be driven by the fiction created by thoughts--, but they also see it as incomplete at best and at worst, just another misguided attempt at trusting the mind as a solution architect to the problems that it creates, which often results in other subtler problems like bypassing.Such traditions don't practice control or avoidance of emotions, but rather use them as teaching devices through aware observation when they manifest in experience (bodily sensations and thoughts). Through this \"witnessing\" there's realization of their fundamental nature, along with surrendering and integration of shadow elements. On the surface the result may appear the same as what stoicism purports to give you, but there's a radical difference. Where stoicism aims for thought-driven control, mystics know there's none to be found and instead encourage to trust in and to reconnect with our intuitive nature. Allow pain, feel it fully, let it go, and return in the flow.If you're not into mysticism, but are interested in this kind of work for the practical purpose of navigating your experience of life with less suffering, here's a secular curriculum: start with some embodiment practice (contemplation in bodily sensations, yoga nidra, body scan meditations, soft butter meditations, Tai Chi, Qigong, any physical activity done with heightened awareness of the body), find a good teacher or therapist to guide you into Shadow Work, supplement with regular Trauma and Tension Release Exercises (TRE), sprinkle some Loving Kindness meditations to take things to another level. Do this and you won't just look the part, you'll feel it to your core.",

You can't fully control things outside of your mind, and when you try to control them, you suffer (e.g. you don't want to get sick, but you will, you don't want to get old , but you will)What I struggled with was applying this \"logical understanding\" to my day-to-day life. In other words, the recommended practice of morning and evening meditation was always too early and too late, respectively. I needed to have tools to use in the difficult moments directly.I recently discovered Acceptance Commitment Therapy - It's an interesting mix of mindfulness and living in accordance with your values. If you also struggle to bring the stoic teachings to your minute-by-minute life, give the book \"ACT made simple\" a try.There are differences.. Stoic teaching would have you analyse the thought (impression) and discard it as something out of your control. Whilst ACT will have you accept that the thought exists, but not identify with it. Stoics give you the values (virtues), ACT lets you pick them. But all in all, those two approaches are complementary.",

So when it's a cup of yours that gets broken, appreciate that you have the same attitude as when it's someone else's cup. Transfer the principle to things of greater importance. Has someone else's child or wife died? There's no one who wouldn't say 'So it goes.' But when it's one's own child or wife who's died, the automatic response is 'Oh, no!' and 'Poor me!'

(To use an analogy: it would be bad for a parent to be a slave to their children, or for a charioteer to be led by their horses instead of controlling them. But ignoring them isn't great either!)Stoicism addresses this preemptively, building a practice of having a proportionate response to things outside our control. Meditation also addresses this by, as you said, noticing emotions when they arise, recognizing them for what they are (creating some distance), and letting them pass instead of indulging them.

Adding a gender label doesn’t improve clarity, it just adds noise.Second, it’s selectively applied. Many traits that are equally destructive are rarely labeled at all, usually because they’re expressed indirectly or through social maneuvering rather than overt force. That doesn’t make them less harmful, just harder to name without breaking the narrative.More broadly, labeling a negative trait as inherently “masculine” is simply rude and unnecessary. “Undesirable traits” works fine and doesn’t require turning half the population into a rhetorical prop.As a non-toxic and extremely moral male biological specimen, I’ll just note that attaching moral failure to the male gender category feels oddly out of step with modern norms around inclusivity.

But if that boat were occupied, you might holler at the person to get out of your way, and it might be upsetting.There's also a passage where Zhuangzi's wife has died, and his friend find him merrily beating a drum. He asks if this is the proper way to mourn his wife. Zhuangzi replies that he had initially cried and lamented when his wife passed, until he realized that she had become what she was before she had lived, and that to everything there was a season. (There's definitely more here than I remember off the top of my head.)Tangentially, if one has only read the Tao Te Ching, the Zhuangzi and Liehzi are also great and worth reading. The Liehzi is very short, and the Zhuangzi can be abridged to the first 7 chapters if desired. (Chapter 17 slaps but is mostly a reiteration of chapter 1.)

      "abstract": "该讨论围绕Mozilla的开源AI战略展开，社区反应呈现明显分歧。核心争议在于用户对Mozilla执行能力的信任度：许多用户对Mozilla近年表现持怀疑态度，认为其已失去公信力，且缺乏成功实施项目的实力或诚意。具体批评包括质疑其AI代理平台与浏览器缺乏关联、数据许可机制的实际价值，以及担忧小规模模型难以与现有大模型竞争。\n\n另一方面，部分用户表现出谨慎乐观。有人认为尽管存在疑虑，但新CEO上任与清晰的战略规划值得给予一定信任空间；也有用户指出，若Mozilla能推出抗衡闭源AI的可行方案，或将促进行业生态健康。讨论中普遍认同的观点是，当前社区对Mozilla的信任已大幅削弱，多数表态均建立在对其过往失误的审视基础上。技术细节方面，有用户对文中提及的模型规格、数据授权假设等提出具体疑问。",

The Arkenfox user.js does all of this and more, but these options are not enabled by default. This shows that Firefox does not care much about privacy in practice.The only \"breakage\" that I have encountered with such a hardened configuration is related to the spoofing of the time zone. But the fundamental issue is that Javascript/browsers should have not been designed to allow websites to extract this kind of personal information in the first place. But even that is not enough and users are still fingerprintable. In an ideal world, the only thing a website should see is the originating IP and nothing else.If anything, Brave has done more to harden Chromium than Mozilla has with Firefox, even though Brave comes with its own set of problems (scammy crypto integrations, AI, VPN and other stuff).",

Messing with kludgy things until they somehow work is always a part of software engineering... but the motive and payoff comes from knowing how things work, and perceiving how they could work better.What I \"fear\" from LLMs-in-coding is that they will provide an unlimited flow of \"mess around until it works\" drudgery tasks with none of the upside. The human role will be hammering at problems which don't really have a \"root cause\" (except in a stochastic sense) and for which there is never any permanent or clever fix.Would we say someone is \"not really an artist\" just because they don't want to spend their days reviewing generated photos for extra-fingers, circling them, and hitting the \"redo\" button?",

Much of that was working with groups to shift spending around between accounts when they invariably made \"mistakes\".One of her biggest projects was shepherding a large group of very old donations through a legal process to remove provisions in the donation agreements that were now illegal. In these cases the donors were long deceased, and the most common rule that needed to be changed was targeting race or ethnicity (e.g.: funds setup to help black people, or Irish, etc...).The sheer number of different variations on \"donor intent\", or even just the wording on that legal document was astounding. There was always a tension between my wife's group and the group that was bringing in the money (\"stewardship\"), her group wanted things to be simpler and the \"stewarding\" group wanted nothing to get in the way of donations.

          "content": "This article lists several of the absurdities of the Date constructor, but only barely touches on the most unforgivable one. The example from the article is:  // Unless, of course, you separate the year, month, and date with hyphens.\n  // Then it gets the _day_ wrong.\n  console.log( new Date('2026-01-02') );\n  // Result: Date Thu Jan 01 2026 19:00:00 GMT-0500 (Eastern Standard Time)\n\nIn this example, the day is \"wrong\" because the constructor input is being interpreted as midnight UTC on January 2nd, and at that instantaneous point in time, it is 7pm on January 1st in Eastern Standard Time (which is the author's local time zone).What's actually happening here is a comedy of errors. JavaScript is interpreting that particular string format (\"YYYY-MM-DD\") as an ISO 8601 date-only form. ISO 8601 specifies that if no time zone designator is provided, the time is assumed to be in local time. The ES5 spec authors intended to match ISO 8601 behavior, but somehow accidentally changed this to 'The value of an absent time zone offset is “Z”' (UTC).Years later, they had realized their mistakes, and attempted to correct it in ES2015. And you can probably predict what happened. When browsers shipped the correct behavior, they got too many reports about websites which were relying on the previous incorrect behavior. So it got completely rolled back, sacrificed to the altar of \"web compatibility.\"For more info, see the \"Broken Parser\" section towards the bottom of this article:https://maggiepint.com/2017/04/11/fixing-javascript-date-web...",

Old Date code gets the old Date code quirks, new code gets the nice new Temporal API.Internal modules would be handy in theory to maybe keep from having to dig through a thesaurus every time browsers decide to add a new, stricter version of an older API. Internal modules have even been proposed to TC-39 as a recommended way to continue to expand the JS API. Last I checked on that proposal it was stuck behind several concerns including:1. Feature detection: detecting if Temporal available is as easy as `if ('Temporal' in globalThis) {}`, but detecting if a module import is missing is a bit harder. Right now the standard is that loading a module fails with an Error if one of its imports fails. You can work around that by doing a dynamic import inside a try/catch, but that's a lot of extra boilerplate compared to `const thingINeed = 'someApi' in globalThis ? someApi() : someApiPolyfill()`. I've seen  multiple proposals on that front from extensions to import maps and `with { }` options on the import itself.2. Bikeshedding (and lots of it): defining a URI scheme like `browser:` or `standard:` takes a bunch of thought on how you expand it. If it is just `browser:some-api` you run the risk of eventually polluting all the easy names in the exact way people worry about the risk of over-polluting `globalThis` (and in the way that it can be weirdly hard to find an available one-word name on npm), you've just moved the naming problem from one place to the other. On the other side, if you go down the road of something like `es-standard:https://tc39.es/ecma262/2025/v1/final-draft/Temporal`, even (especially) assuming users would mostly importmap that to something shorter you've recreated XMLNS URIs in a funny new hat and people who use JS all certainly have plenty of opinions on XMLNS URIs, many are very vocal in their hatred of it, but also they came out of a strong backwards incompatibility fixing desire exactly like this.

A PlainDate is just a date. A PlainTime is just a time. (\"We eat lunch at 11am each day.\") A ZonedDateTime is an Instant in a known time zone. Etc.Temporal draws a lot of inspiration from Java's Joda-Time (which also went on to inspire .NET's Noda Time, Java's official java.time API, and JavaScript's js-joda).

And, more importantly, it means that it benefits from a lot of careful thought on how to ergonomically and effectively represent date/time complexities.",

If there is ever a DateTime string in a Date column in the database, it's impossible to know what the date was supposed to be unless you know you normalized it at some point on the way up.Then I found that a lot of DatePicker libraries, despite being in \"DATE\" picker mode, will still append a local timezone to its value.

Can I use the fly oidc provider[1]? There's a /.sprite/api.sock but curl'ing /v1/tokens/oidc gets a 404.- How much is it going to cost me?

I’m not really aware of what everyone else is doing with sandboxes etc.But the bit at the end with the MDM server made it click for me. I’ve started generating tiny iOS apps for personal software stuff, because they solve data storage better than the web (at least on iOS). A database on some other server seems like a bad fit/overkill for this stuff, client side storage is too flaky because Safari. But iOS apps are limiting in their own annoying ways compared to web apps.This looks like a really interesting solution, I can just store the data on a sprite with SQLite or whatever. Visit its URL to use my app, then does it go away on its own after a short time? I could have done that before with a server with storage, but this seems easier/probably cheaper.If this works well/the way I’m hoping it might be the sweet spot for simple personal software that needs persistent data and you want to run anywhere.One feature that would make this really nice is if it could have something like Vercel preview environments, where I need to auth my fly account to view the URL. That'd solve the public URL without me needing to do my own auth thing in every app.",

I think you could use TestFlight, which is Apple's method for distributing an unreleased version of an app, but I'm not sure what the review process would look like for that. Android would be much easier as long as you can still sideload APKs, you could just build the APK and send it to everyone to install.

Usual caveats, and I'm only running them on my own phone. I ask Claude (not code) to help me with the spec, I give it some bullet points and it asks a bunch of clarifying questions then gives me a spec. I put that in a new directory, fire up Claude and use the ralph-loop plugin (https://github.com/anthropics/claude-code/tree/main/plugins/...):> /ralph-loop:ralph-loop \"Implement the iOS app described in app-spec.md.

That's straightforward.But it's not like you're writing a \"metabrainz crawler\" and a \"metafilter crawler\" and a \"wiki.roshangeorge.dev crawler\". You're presumably trying to write a general Internet crawler. You encounter a site that is clearly a HTTP view into some git repo (say). How do you know to just `git clone` the repo in order to have the data archived as opposed to just browsing the HTTP view.As you can see, I've got a lot of crawlers on my blog as well, but it's a mediawiki instance. I'd gladly host a Mediawiki dump for them to take, but then they'd have to know this was a Mediawiki-based site. How do I tell them that? The humans running the program don't know my site exists. Their bot just browses the universe and finds links and does things.In the Metabrainz case, it's not like the crawler writer knows Metabrainz even exists. It's probably just linked somewhere in the web the crawler is exploring. There's no \"if Metabrainz, do this\" anywhere in there.The robots.txt is a bit of a blunt-force instrument, and friendly bot writers should follow it. But assuming they do, there's no way for them to know that \"inefficient path A to data\" is the same as \"efficient path B to data\" if both are visible to their bot unless they write a YourSite-specific crawler.What I want is to have a way to say \"the canonical URL for the data on A is at URL B; you can save us both trouble by just fetching B\". In practice, none of this is a problem for me. I cache requests at Cloudflare, and I have Mediawiki caching generated pages, so I can easily weather the bot traffic. But I want to enable good bot writers to save their own resources. It's not reasonable for me to expect them to write a me-crawler, but if there is a format to specify the rules I'm happy to be compliant.",

This is predicated on the idea that the NIST numbers set is sort of the \"hello world\" dataset for people wanting to learn machine vision and having that common data set is really handy. Numbers made up off the top of my head/subject to tuning but the basic idea is this:1) Cut copyright to 15-20 years by default. You can have 1 extension of an additional 10-15 years if you submit your work to the \"National Data Set\" within say 2-3 years of the initial publication.2) Content in the National set is well categorized and cleaned up. It's the cleanest data set anyone could want. The data set is used both to train some public models and also licensed out to people wanting to train their own models. Both the public models and the data sets are licensed for nominal fees.3) People who use the public models or data sets as part of their AI system are granted immunity from copyright violation claims for content generated by these models, modulo some exceptions for knowing and intentional violations (e.g. generating the contents of a book into an epub). People who choose to scrape their own data are subject to the current state of the law with regards to both scraping and use (so you probably better be buying a lot of books).4) The license fees generated from licensing the data and the models would be split into royalty payments to people whose works are in the dataset, and are still under copyright protection, proportional to the amount of data submitted and inversely proportional to the age of that data. There would be some absolute caps in place to prevent slamming the national data sets with junk data just to pump the numbers.Everyone gets something out of this. AI folks get clean data, that they didn't have to burn a lot of resources scraping. Copyright holders get paid for their works used by AI and retain most of the protections they have today, just for a shorter time), the public gets usable AI tooling without everyone spending their own resources on building their own data sets, site owners and the like get reduced bot/scraping traffic.

I can handle it, but it's a nuisance and they're basically just scraping garbage (statistics pages of historical matches or user pages that have essentially no content).Many of them don't even self-identify and end up scraping with shrouded user-agents or via bot-farms. I've had to block entire ASNs just to tone it down. It also hurts good-faith actors who genuinely want to build on top of our APIs because I have to block some cloud providers.I would guess that I'm getting anywhere from 10-25 AI bot requests (maybe more) per real user request - and at scale that ends up being quite a lot. I route bot traffic to separate pods just so it doesn't hinder my real users' experience[0].

It's over a hundred kLoC of C++, and given the public support for memory safety by both Google and Mozilla it would be extremely embarrassing if a security vulnerability in libjxl lead to a zero-click zero-day in either Chrome or Firefox.The timing is probably a sign that Chrome considers the Rust implementation of JPEG-XL to be mature enough (or at least heading in that direction) to start kicking the tires.",

It lets you dereference pointers (which is not a particularly unusual operation in many other languages) and call some functions that need extra care. Usually the presence of \"unsafe\" really just means that you needed to interface with foreign functions or hardware or something.This is all to say: implying that mere presence of an \"unsafe\" keyword is a sign that code is insecure is very, very silly.",

First of all, there were forms of \"AI\" before modern Gen AI (machine learning, NLP, computer vision, predictive algorithms, etc) that were and are very valuable for specific use cases. Not much has changed there AFAICT, so it's fair that the broader conversation about Gen AI is focused on general use cases deployed across general populations. After all, Microsoft thinks it's a copilot company, so it's fair to talk about how copilots are doing.On the pro-AI side, people are conflating technology success with product success. Look at crypto -- the technology supports decentralization, anonymity, and use as a currency; but in the marketplace it is centralized, subject to KYC, and used for speculation instead of transactions. The potential of the tech does not always align with the way the world decides to use it.On the other side of the aisle, people are conflating the problematic socio-economics of AI with the state of the technology. I think you're correct to call it a failure of PMF, and that's a problem worth writing articles about.

There is little added value to a voiced updateI couldn't disagree more. I know it's an unpopular opinion, but when standups are done synchronously, everyone actually pays attention, notices blocks and helps with them. Things get surfaced and quickly addressed that simply wouldn't otherwise, which is the purpose of standups. When it's async, people just put in what they're working on and mostly ignore everyone else. Standups need to be about 2-way communication, not 1-way.And retrospectives are about improving how the team works. Every team has challenges of every kind. Retrospectives are for surfacing those and addressing them.

Getting the awkward out of the way with a formal agenda can really help to get into the guts of it. Rather than having to manipulate the conversation to get to an emotional item, the manager can just flat-out ask the question because it's on the agenda.Obviously, you can overdo this, and it can turn into a nightmare for folks so I can see why TFA proposes eliminating them.

Demotivating them just requires not understanding any of that, or ignoring it in favour of feeding your own ego or psychology. It's a lot easier to demotivate.",

Once you have a team where the founder doesn't know everyone, the average matters a lot more.If you have 15 people, you can hire 15 people and they will be able to organically organize if you hire well. If they have a question, they know what everyone is working on. The code base is small enough that everyone can just figure it out even if the documentation is bad.The larger that group is, the more effort it takes to make sure everyone has the context they need to get their job done. That's where management matters.And honestly, when I was the first manager (team of 17) brought in, I was writing code and on my own project in addition to starting to build up the \"what do we need to do to scale?\" You bring someone like me in at 17 people because you're going to need to scale soon and someone needs to build the first set of processes that solve the problems of the next stage, and figure out the onramp because done wrong, they make everything worse.",

You were a MARINE!?  I want to manage my team like a military outfit.\"  unfortunately, my response was \"WHAT!?  You want to spend 80% of your budget on training and logistics!?\"  that was probably not the best thing to say in that situation.also... if we're talking about applying military metaphors to product development, it's worth it to look up the various OODA talks by John Boyd.  i don't know if i agree with all of it, and it's not directly applicable.  but there's enough there to justify at least reading about it.  Boyd was a friend of my dad's, so i remember thinking he was crazy when i met him as a child, but again, he may have been crazy, but he was definitely an intellectual outsider who hit more than he missed.",

(and d, knew how to give good code review comments without pissing people off.)but... they also needed an environment where they could push back and say things like \"i do not feel participating in today's 1-on-1 meeting (or meeting with product management) is a good use of my time\", where task design gave them chunks of work that were appropriate and they were given the freedom to identify (and avoid) \"wicked\" problems.which is to say... i don't think the story of the ninja/unicorn is complete fantasy, but management has to understand how it's real and craft an environment where an engineer's inner-unicorn can emerge.",

Heard similar stories from colleagues from Italy and France.So work hours are super dependent on local culture and industry.

The CORS fix removes exploitation by arbitrary websites (but obviously allows full access from the opencode domain), but let's take that piece out for a second...What's the difference here between this and, for example, the Neovim headless server or the VSCode remote SSH daemon? All three listen on 127.0.0.1 and would grant execution access to another process who could speak to them.Is there a difference here? Is the choice of HTTP simply a bad one because of the potential browser exploitation, which can't exist for the others?",

My preference is to talk about something else while playing board games.One thing I've found when talking to non-technical board gamers about AI is that while they’re 100% against using AI to generate art or game design, when you ask them about using AI tools to build software or websites the response is almost always something like \"Programmers are expensive, I can't afford that. If I can use AI to cut programmers out of the process I'm going to do it.\"A minority are conflicted about this position.When I talk to technical people at game nights we almost never talk about tech. The one time our programmers all played RoboRally the night kind of died because it felt too close to work for a Saturday night.If GW was going to use AI they would probably start with sprue layouts.

I don't know how you would realistically implement it and to what extent? That solution implies we have to move toward zero-trust architectures even within open communities.As an example: formal proofs and compartmentalization are unsexy but they're a solid way we survive the next decade of adversarial noise.I remember reading a quote somewhere that stuck with me. Paraphrasing, \"If the architecture of my code doesn't enforce privacy and resistance to censorship by default, we have to assume it will be weaponized\".I am out of ideas, practical ones, lots sound good on paper and in theory.

So for example, books attribute citations with footnotes.With source code we used to either re-used a library as-is, in which case the license terms would apply OR write our own implementation from scratch.

      "abstract": "该讨论围绕Signal负责人对“智能体AI”安全风险的警告展开。核心争议在于这类自主AI系统是否构成不可靠的监控威胁。有用户指出，这本质是操作系统层面的安全问题，AI只是暴露了长期存在的进程隔离缺陷。也有观点认为，企业应优先考虑风险管控而非绝对安全，普通用户未必需要Signal级别的隐私保护。讨论中提到，部分用户主张通过硬件隔离、零信任交互等技术手段限制AI对敏感数据的访问，以实现安全与功能的平衡。同时，不少用户对当前行业盲目追求AI自主性表示担忧，认为不可预测的“幻觉”或数据泄露会使系统变得危险。尽管存在分歧，社区普遍认同智能体AI需在严格约束下使用，完全开放权限将带来严重安全隐患。",

A good example I once read about was an AI to parse customer requests: if it detects a request that the user is entitle to (e.g. cancel subscription) it will send a message like \"Our AI thinks you want to cancel your subscription, is this correct?\" and only after confirmation by the user will the action be carried out. To be reliable the AI itself must not determine whether the user is entitled to cancelling, it may only guess the the user's intention and then pass a message to a non-AI deterministic service. This way users don't have to wait until a human gets around to reading the message.There is still the problem of human psychology though. If you have an AI that's 90% accurate and you have a human confirm each decision, the human's mind will start drifting off and treat 90% as if it's 100%.",

This is including huge companies with dedicated, well-staffed security teams... Policy-making is hard, and maintaining the ever-growing set of rules is even harder. AI provides incredible opportunity for implementing and auditing of granular RBAC/ReBAC policies, but I'm yet to see a company that would actually leverage it to that end.On a different note: we saw Microsoft seemingly \"commit to zero trust,\" however in reality their system allowed dangling long-lived tokens in production systems, which resulted in compromise by state actors.

      "content": "Reddit's API is effectively dead for archival. Third-party apps are gone. Reddit has threatened to cut off access to the Pushshift dataset multiple times. But 3.28TB of Reddit history exists as a torrent right now, and I built a tool to turn it into something you can browse on your own hardware.The key point: This doesn't touch Reddit's servers. Ever. Download the Pushshift dataset, run my tool locally, get a fully browsable archive. Works on an air-gapped machine. Works on a Raspberry Pi serving your LAN. Works on a USB drive you hand to someone.What it does: Takes compressed data dumps from Reddit (.zst), Voat (SQL), and Ruqqus (.7z) and generates static HTML. No JavaScript, no external requests, no tracking. Open index.html and browse. Want search? Run the optional Docker stack with PostgreSQL – still entirely on your machine.API & AI Integration: Full REST API with 30+ endpoints – posts, comments, users, subreddits, full-text search, aggregations. Also ships with an MCP server (29 tools) so you can query your archive directly from AI tools.Self-hosting options:\n - USB drive / local folder (just open the HTML files)\n - Home server on your LAN\n - Tor hidden service (2 commands, no port forwarding needed)\n - VPS with HTTPS\n - GitHub Pages for small archivesWhy this matters: Once you have the data, you own it. No API keys, no rate limits, no ToS changes can take it away.Scale: Tens of millions of posts per instance. PostgreSQL backend keeps memory constant regardless of dataset size. For the full 2.38B post dataset, run multiple instances by topic.How I built it: Python, PostgreSQL, Jinja2 templates, Docker. Used Claude Code throughout as an experiment in AI-assisted development. Learned that the workflow is \"trust but verify\" – it accelerates the boring parts but you still own the architecture.Live demo: https://online-archives.github.io/redd-archiver-example/GitHub: https://github.com/19-84/redd-archiver (Public Domain)Pushshift torrent: https://academictorrents.com/details/1614740ac8c94505e4ecb9d...",

There's only so many names out there, and occasionally they get fairly recycled.",

Now it's just like any other synth. Then you can get a second Tulip and do the same thing later if you like. You could do this with laptops of course but it starts to get expensive.The Pocket Operators have something similar (the KO at least, maybe the others). If you've written samples into them you want to preserve for playing live, you can snap a tab off and then they're read-only - no surprises on gig night.",
