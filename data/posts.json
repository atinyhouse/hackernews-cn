          "content": "This is a much more reasonable take than the cursor-browser thing. A few things that make it pretty impressive:> This was a clean-room implementation (Claude did not have internet access at any point during its development); it depends only on the Rust standard library. The 100,000-line compiler can build Linux 6.9 on x86, ARM, and RISC-V. It can also compile QEMU, FFmpeg, SQlite, postgres, redis>  I started by drafting what I wanted: a from-scratch optimizing compiler with no dependencies, GCC-compatible, able to compile the Linux kernel, and designed to support multiple backends. While I specified some aspects of the design (e.g., that it should have an SSA IR to enable multiple optimization passes) I did not go into any detail on how to do so.> Previous Opus 4 models were barely capable of producing a functional compiler. Opus 4.5 was the first to cross a threshold that allowed it to produce a functional compiler which could pass large test suites, but it was still incapable of compiling any real large projects.And the very open points about limitations (and hacks, as cc loves hacks):> It lacks the 16-bit x86 compiler that is necessary to boot [...] Opus was unable to implement a 16-bit x86 code generator needed to boot into 16-bit real mode. While the compiler can output correct 16-bit x86 via the 66/67 opcode prefixes, the resulting compiled output is over 60kb, far exceeding the 32k code limit enforced by Linux. Instead, Claude simply cheats here and calls out to GCC for this phase> It does not have its own assembler and linker;> Even with all optimizations enabled, it outputs less efficient code than GCC with all optimizations disabled.Ending with a very down to earth take:> The resulting compiler has nearly reached the limits of Opus’s abilities. I tried (hard!) to fix several of the above limitations but wasn’t fully successful. New features and bugfixes frequently broke existing functionality.All in all, I'd say it's a cool little experiment, impressive even with the limitations, and a good test-case as the author says \"The resulting compiler has nearly reached the limits of Opus’s abilities\".

A few things that make it pretty impressive:> This was a clean-room implementation (Claude did not have internet access at any point during its development); it depends only on the Rust standard library. The 100,000-line compiler can build Linux 6.9 on x86, ARM, and RISC-V. It can also compile QEMU, FFmpeg, SQlite, postgres, redis>  I started by drafting what I wanted: a from-scratch optimizing compiler with no dependencies, GCC-compatible, able to compile the Linux kernel, and designed to support multiple backends. While I specified some aspects of the design (e.g., that it should have an SSA IR to enable multiple optimization passes) I did not go into any detail on how to do so.> Previous Opus 4 models were barely capable of producing a functional compiler. Opus 4.5 was the first to cross a threshold that allowed it to produce a functional compiler which could pass large test suites, but it was still incapable of compiling any real large projects.And the very open points about limitations (and hacks, as cc loves hacks):> It lacks the 16-bit x86 compiler that is necessary to boot [...] Opus was unable to implement a 16-bit x86 code generator needed to boot into 16-bit real mode. While the compiler can output correct 16-bit x86 via the 66/67 opcode prefixes, the resulting compiled output is over 60kb, far exceeding the 32k code limit enforced by Linux. Instead, Claude simply cheats here and calls out to GCC for this phase> It does not have its own assembler and linker;> Even with all optimizations enabled, it outputs less efficient code than GCC with all optimizations disabled.Ending with a very down to earth take:> The resulting compiler has nearly reached the limits of Opus’s abilities. I tried (hard!) to fix several of the above limitations but wasn’t fully successful. New features and bugfixes frequently broke existing functionality.All in all, I'd say it's a cool little experiment, impressive even with the limitations, and a good test-case as the author says \"The resulting compiler has nearly reached the limits of Opus’s abilities\". Yeah, that's fair, but still highly imrpessive IMO."

Standardization, and working with a team of developers all using the same framework has huge benefits. The same is true with agents. Agents have finite context, when an agent knows it is using rails, it automatically can assume a lot about how things work. LLM training data has a lot of framework use patterns deeply instilled. Agents using frameworks that LLMs have extensive training on produce high quality, consistent results without needing to provide a bunch of custom context for bespoke foundational code.

Standardization, and working with a team of developers all using the same framework has huge benefits. The same is true with agents. Agents have finite context, when an agent knows it is using rails, it automatically can assume a lot about how things work. LLM training data has a lot of framework use patterns deeply instilled. Agents using frameworks that LLMs have extensive training on produce high quality, consistent results without needing to provide a bunch of custom context for bespoke foundational code.

The Anthropic models when used through GH Copilot were far superior to the codex ones and I didn't really get the hype of Codex. Using them through the CLI though, Codex is much better, IMO.My guess is that it's potentially that and just momentum from developers who started using CC when it was far superior to Codex has allowed it to become so much more popular.

And who cares if the server room is a total loss after a while, worst case you write some more YAML and Terraform and deploy a temporary replacement in the cloud.Another thing between is colocation, where you put hardware you own in a managed data center. It’s a bit old fashioned, but it may make sense in some cases.I can also mention that research HPCs may be worth considering. In research, we  have some of the world fastest computers at a fraction of the cost of cloud computing. It’s great as long as you don’t mind not being root and having to use slurm.I don’t know in USA, but in Norway you can run your private company slurm AI workloads on research HPCs, though you will pay quite a bit more than universities and research institutions. But you can also have research projects together with universities or research institutions, and everyone will be happy if your business benefits a lot from the collaboration.",

And who cares if the 服务器 room is a total loss after a while, worst case you write some more YAML and Terraform and deploy a temporary replacement in the cloud.Another thing between is colocation, where you put hardware you own in a managed data center. It’s a bit old fashioned, but it may make sense in some cases.I can also mention that research HPCs may be worth considering. In research, we  have some of the world fastest computers at a fraction of the cost of cloud computing. It’s great as long as you don’t mind not being root and having to use slurm.I don’t know in USA, but in Norway you can run your private company slurm 人工智能 workloads on research HPCs, though you will pay quite a bit more than universities and research institutions. But you can also have research projects together with universities or research institutions, and everyone will be happy if your business benefits a lot from the collaboration."

At that point you probably have additional cost measured in 5-10 FTE in staffing anyway to babysit all of that.

If you're using something like ECS or serverless, AWS gains nothing by optimizing the servers to make your code run faster - their hard work results in less billed infrastructure hours.This 'microservices' push usually means that instead of having an on-server session where you can serve stuff from a temporary cache, all the data that persists between requests needs to be stored in a db somewhere, all the auth logic needs to re-check your credentials, and something needs to direct the traffic and load balance these endpoint, and all this stuff costs money.I think if you have 4 Java boxes as servers with a redundant DB with read replicas on EC2, your infra is so efficient and cheap that even paying 4x for it rather than going for colocation is well worth it because of the QoL and QoS.These crazy AWS bills usually come from using every service under the sun.",

But there's a long tail of semi-technical users who are more comfortable in 2-3 or even 1, which is what ultimately traps them into the ransomware-adjacent situation that is a lot of the modern public cloud. I would push back on \"usage-based\". Yes it is technically usage-based but the base fee also goes way up and there are also sometimes retainers on these services (ie minimum spend).

If opex is so exceedingly high for cloud, pushing people back to capex to save money, then why has no cloud entrant come around with a price competitive alternative?It seems the main issue is that everyone is anchored to 亚马逊云服务 so they have no incentive to reduce their prices. Probably same for Azure. I think Google is just risky because they kill products so easily."

This is defined (and server equipment manufacturers conform and build to) ASHRAE TC 9.9.  This mean - if you're running your servers above high risk curve for humidity and temperature, you're shortening the life considerably compared to low risk curve.Generally, 15% RH is considered suboptimal and can be dangerous near freezing temperatures - in San Diego in January there were several 90%+RH scenarios that would have been dangerous for servers even when mixed down with warm exhaust air - furthermore, the outdoor air at 76'f during that period means you have limited capacity to mix in warm exhaust air (which btw came from that same 99%RH input air) without getting into higher-than-ideal intake temps.Any dew points above 62.5'f are considered high risk for servers - as are any intake temps exceeding 32'C/90'f.  You want to be on the midpoint between those and 16'C/65'f temps & -12'C/10'f dew point to have no impact on server longevity or MTBF rates.As a recent example:  KCASANDI6112 - January 2, 2026\n\n                 High         Low      Average\n\n  Temperature    73.4 °F   59.9 °F      63.5 °F\n\n  Dew Point      68.0 °F   60.0 °F      62.6 °F\n\n  Humidity       99 %      81 %         96 %\n\n  Precipitation  0.12 in   --           --\n\nLastly, air contaminants - in the form of dust (that can be filtered out) and chemicals (which can't without extensive scrubbing) are probably the most detrimental to server equipment if not properly managed, and require very intentional and frequent filter changes (typically high MERV pleated filters changed on a time or pressure drop signal) to prevent server degradation and equipment risks.The last consideration is fire suppression - permitted datacenters usually require compliance with separate fire code, such that direct outdoor air exchange without active shutdown and dry suppression is not permitted - this is to prevent a scenario where your equipment catches on fire and a constant supply of fresh oxygen-rich outdoor air turns that into an inferno.  Smoke detection systems don't operate well with outdoor-mixed air or any level of airborn particulates.So - for those reasons - among a few others - open air datacenters are not recommended unless you're doing them at google or meta scale, and in those scenarios you typically have much more extensive systems and purpose-designed hardware in order to operate for the design life of the equipment without issues.",

Framing the issue solely as NIMBY opposition misses the structural imbalance at the core of the problem.Instead of treating symptoms or assigning blame, governments should focus on correcting the underlying mismatch between employment growth and housing supply."

I understand the reasons, but I wish there had been a smoother path to this future. The early LLMs like GPT-3 could sort of code enough for it to look like there was a lot of potential, and so there was a lot of hype to drum up investment and a lot of promises made that weren't really viable with the tech as it was then. This created a large number of AI skeptics (of whom I was one, for a while) and a whole bunch of cynicism and suspicion and resistance amongst a large swathe of developers. But could it have been different? It seems a lot of transformative new tech is fated to evolve this way. Early aircraft were extremely unreliable and dangerous and not yet worthy of the promises being made about them, but eventually with enough evolution and lessons learned we got the  Douglas DC-3, and then in the end the 747.If you're a developer who still doesn't believe that AI tools are useful, I would recommend you go read Mitchell's post, and give Claude Code a trial run like he did.  Try and forget about the annoying hype and the vibe-coding influencers and the noise and just treat it like any new tool you might put through its paces. There are many important conversations about AI to be had, it has plenty of downsides, but a proper discussion begins with close engagement with the tools.",

You should disable agent notifications and take control of when you return to check the model context to be less ADHD ridden when programming with agents and actually make meaningful progress on the side task since you only context switch when you are satisfied. The final one is to always have at least one agent and preferably only one agent running in the background. The idea is that always having an agent results in a slow burn of productivity improvements and a process where you can slowly improve the background agent performance.

They are a psychological tool and that, AFAIK, don't work well with the 人工智能 models. If the code is important enough that you want to review it then you should probably be using a different, more interactive flow.Mitchell talks about this in a round about way... in the \"Reproduce your own work\" section he obviously reviewed that code as that was the point.

The price can drop TBH and while there is some correlation on $/capita output.The more nuanced \"outrage\" here, how taking humans out of the agent loop is, as I have commented elsewhere, quite flawed TBH and very bold to say the least. And while every VC is salivating, more attention should instead be given to all the 人工智能 Agent PMs, The Tech lead of 人工智能, or whatever that title is on some of the following:- What _workflow_ are you building?\n- What is your success with your team/new hires in having them use this?\n- What's your RoC for investment in the workflow?\n- How varied is this workflow? Is every company just building their own workflows or are there patterns emerging on agent orchestration that are useful."

E.g.: Matrix powers chat and LiveKit powers Visio (which was recently featured on HN as well when they announced it's rolled out to replace Zoom / Teams, etc [1])I'm fortunate to be collaborating with them as their Docs product is built on top of our open source BlockNote text editor (https://www.blocknotejs.org).Docs specifically started as an international collaboration with Germany [2] to explore how different EU countries can collaborate in building sovereign workplace solutions (several other countries including NL have shown interest as well).They're actively supporting us, and related projects like Yjs (https://yjs.dev) by sponsoring feature development.I'm sure many of the team members will follow along here as well! Happy to answer any questions.[1] https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46873294\n[2] https://www.zendis.de/en"

Salesforce gave Heroku a ton of funding to build out a vision that was way ahead of its time. Docker didn’t even come out until 2013, AWS didn’t even have multiple regions when it was built. They mostly served as an investor and left us alone to do our thing, or so it seemed those first couple years.The launch of the multi language Cedar runtime in 2011 led to incredible growth and by 2012 we were drowning in tech debt and scaling challenges. Despite more than tripling our headcount in that first year (~20 to 74) we could not keep up.Mid 2012 was especially bad as we were severely impacted by two us-east-1 outages just 2 weeks apart. To the extent it wasn’t already, reliability and paying down tech debt became the main focus and I think we went about 18 months between major user-facing platform launches (Europe region and eventually larger sized dynos being the biggest things we eventually shipped after that drought). The organization lost its ability to ship significant changes or maybe never really had that ability at scale.That time coincided with the founders taking a step back, leaving a loss of leadership and vision that was filled by people more concerned with process than results. I left in 2014 and at that time it already seemed clear to me that the product was basically stalled.I’m not sure how much of this could have been done better even in hindsight. In theory Salesforce could have taken a more hands on approach early on but I don’t think that could have ended better. They were so far from profitability in late 2010 that they could not stay independent without raising more funding. The venture market in ~2010 was much smaller than a few years later—tiny rounds and low valuations. Had the company spent its pre-acquisition engineering cycles building for scalability & reliability at the expense of product velocity they probably would have never gotten successful.Even still, it was the most amazing professional experience of my career, full of brilliant and passionate people, and it’s sad to see it end this way.",

Lots of moving parts and second guessing (that I won't share), but one thing I will say is: Incentives matter.The seeds of this outcome were planted years ago when sales comp plans changed.

I hadn't looked at it for so long that I didn't realize it had fallen out of favor.> That time coincided with the founders taking a step back, leaving a loss of leadership and vision that was filled by people more concerned with process than resultsThis feels all too familiar. All of my enjoyable startup experiences have ended this way: The fast growing, successful startup starts attracting people who look like they should be valuable assets to the company, but they're more interested in things like policies, processes, meetings, and making the status reports look nice than actually shipping and building."

What I appreciate here is that the tradeoffs are made explicit instead of buried behind UX.\nOne open question I’d be curious about: how you reason about coercion risk over time (friends change, incentives change), and whether you see this as something users should periodically re-shard as relationships evolve.",

Shamir-based social recovery assumes:\ntrusted third parties remain reachable,\nthey are willing and able to cooperate,\nand that recovery is an exceptional event.\nStateless systems assume the inverse:\nno one can be relied on,\nrecovery is impossible by design,\nand the primary threat is silent compromise rather than lockout.\nNeither is “better” universally; they’re value judgments. What I appreciate here is that the tradeoffs are made explicit instead of buried behind UX.\nOne open question I’d be curious about: how you reason about coercion risk over time (friends change, incentives change), and whether you see this as something users should periodically re-shard as relationships evolve."

Create a single-purpose Gmail account and set up Inactive Account Manager to provide Google Drive access to your trusted contacts at the designated time. Put a single document in the drive that contains whatever your recovery instructions are, and encrypt it with the secret that is unlocked with your M-of-N Shamir shares.Now you don't have to trust your M of N friends as much, because they can conspire to unlock the secret early, but they won't get access to the document that the secret unlocks until after your demise.There are non-fatal problems with this approach -- your N friends have to recognize the email they receive from a strange Gmail address 3 months after you're gone. You might lose the password to the Gmail account and be unable to get in there yourself, causing it to declare you dead when you're not. All these issues can be mitigated with extra care."

Then, in the 70s and 80s computer technology became the center of innovation and we got cyberpunk and a lot of sci-fi turned inward to virtual worlds and the like.

For well over a century a lot of that frontier was transportation: and we got \"Around the World in 80 Days\" and \"20000 Leagues under the Sea\" and then a lot of books about space. We also got \"Canticle for Leibowitz\" and other post-apocalyptic books out of the age when nuclear weapons and energy was top of mind. Then, in the 70s and 80s computer technology became the center of innovation and we got cyberpunk and a lot of sci-fi turned inward to virtual worlds and the like. Given we're in a new space age, maybe sci-fi will start to follow? I'm certainly seeing a new wave of 人工智能 centric fiction."

It reminds me of the old joke about prisoners and numbers for jokes (Stanislaw Lem has a similar concept in a book):A prisoner, new to a particular cell block, was surprised to discover that his fellow inmates passed much of their day by calling out numbers, after which they would laugh heartily for a few moments. Every few minutes an inmate would call out a number and everyone would laugh, and then, after a few moments of silence, someone else would call out a number, and once again laughter. The inmate asked one of the other inmates whom he'd come to know to explain this strange behavior to him.\"It's simple\", came the reply. \"We know all of our jokes by heart, and there's really no reason to tell them at lenght. Instead, we simply call them out by number.\"Though this was strange to him, the new inmate thought he'd join in on the fun.

It reminds me of the old joke about prisoners and numbers for jokes (Stanislaw Lem has a similar concept in a book):A prisoner, new to a particular cell block, was surprised to discover that his fellow inmates passed much of their day by calling out numbers, after which they would laugh heartily for a few moments. Every few minutes an inmate would call out a number and everyone would laugh, and then, after a few moments of silence, someone else would call out a number, and once again laughter. The inmate asked one of the other inmates whom he'd come to know to explain this strange behavior to him.\"It's simple\", came the reply. \"We know all of our jokes by heart, and there's really no reason to tell them at lenght. Instead, we simply call them out by number.\"Though this was strange to him, the new inmate thought he'd join in on the fun.

To me it's an example of how unrestricted access to bling features causes a mess.Eventually I want it converted to C (C23), split apart in seperate functions with a decent source code organisation, and simplified processes to make it easier to understand what's going on and extend fuctionality. For this I need it simplified as possible and weed out the layer of complexity caused by C++ first. Going to take plenty of time, but I'm still having fun doing it (most of the time anyway :-p ).I'm not advocating anything, but it's satifying to me to bring clarity to code and see small improvements to performance during the process at the same time.

To me it's an example of how unrestricted access to bling features causes a mess.Eventually I want it converted to C (C23), split apart in seperate functions with a decent source code organisation, and simplified processes to make it easier to understand what's going on and extend fuctionality. For this I need it simplified as possible and weed out the layer of complexity caused by C++ first. Going to take plenty of time, but I'm still having fun doing it (most of the time anyway :-p ).I'm not advocating anything, but it's satifying to me to bring clarity to code and see small improvements to performance during the process at the same time. It also gave me an opportunity to develop a unique syntax style that visualises parts of the code better for me."

Java is interesting because the core language is indeed small and boring in a good way, much closer to C than people admit. The productivity gains mostly come from the standard library, GC, and tooling rather than clever language features. For games, the real disagreement is usually about who controls allocation, lifetime, and performance cliffs, not syntax."

They probably deny no one and don't turn anyone away.  Unethical and lacks physician oversight."

I bet a large part of the reason you can get the name brands cheaper now is because they did the math they’d make more that way than they could squeeze out of insurance companies.Also, on a personal level it rubs me the wrong way to have my insurance premiums go towards something that people could just do themselves, from something they did to themselves.

One of Blair's jobs was to translate news broadcasts into Basic English for broadcast to the colonies, primarily India and Hong Kong. He found that this was a political act. Squeezing news down to a 1000 word vocabulary required removing political ambiguity. It's hard to prevaricate in Basic English, which has a very concrete vocabulary. Hence Newspeak.The details of Winston Smith's job are close to Blair's job. The rather bleak canteen matches the one at the Ministry of Information.

One of Blair's jobs was to translate news broadcasts into Basic English for broadcast to the colonies, primarily India and Hong Kong. He found that this was a political act. Squeezing news down to a 1000 word vocabulary required removing political ambiguity. It's hard to prevaricate in Basic English, which has a very concrete vocabulary. Hence Newspeak.The details of Winston Smith's job are close to Blair's job. The rather bleak canteen matches the one at the Ministry of Information. A middle manager above Blair had the initials \"B B\", and that's where Big Brother comes from. The low quality gin, cigarettes, and razor blades are the WWII British experience.\"1984\" is in some ways Dilbert, with more politics."

If 1984 weren't set in the future, he wouldn't have any gripes with it, I'm sure.The one thing Asimov gives Orwell credit for is predicting that there would be three separate great powers?

Or how he complains that Orwell used a missile strike, instead of calling it what, a 2X00 Plasma Fueled Missile Strike? It's not about the missile strike. It's about the fear the missile strike incites into people. People afraid are easy to control.Or about how the warring nations didn't use nukes.

If part of your delivery chain tops out at 30 meters per day you're going to have a slow delivery service. The ratio between the speed of code execution and 人工智能 \"thinking\" is worse than this analogy."

It helps explain why models seem to have a natural lifetime, once deployed at scale, they start interacting with and shaping the environment they were trained on. Over time, data distributions, usage patterns, and incentives shift enough that the model no longer functions as the one originally created, even if the weights themselves haven’t changed.That also makes sense of the common perception that a model feels “decayed” right before a new release. It’s probably not that the model is getting worse, but that expectations and use cases have moved on, people push it into new regimes, and feedback loops expose mismatches between current tasks and what it was originally tuned for.In that light, releasing a new model isn’t just about incremental improvements in architecture or scale; it’s also a reset against drift, reflexivity, and a changing world. Prediction and performance don’t disappear, but they’re transient, bounded by how long the underlying assumptions remain valid.That means all the AI companies that \"retire\" a model is not because of their new better model only, but also because of decay?PS.

There's a lot of bad (and by bad, I mean misaligned with modern voice science and science-informed pedagogy) on the internet, so it's nice to see a resource striving to organize some good information.A couple recommendations I'd suggest exploring to be even better aligned with current understanding:Current literature does not distinguish between head voice and falsetto. While \"falsetto\" often carries a connotation of breathiness, that is not inherent to the register. Both are referred to in literature as laryngial mode M2, in which the Cricothyroid muscle is dominant in shaping the vocal folds. In contrast, chest voice or M1 is Thyroarytenoid dominant. While that may be a bit in the weeds, I found wrapping my head around this very helpful in cutting through a lot of confusing language around head voice .Use of these different registers changes across genre and voice type. Classical sopranos and mezzos use head voice in their upper range, while musical theatre sopranos and mezzos bring their chest voice up (i.e. belting). Meanwhile, tenors and basses typically use chest voice for their full range in both classical and musical theatre genres, with much more use of head voice in pop/contemporary genres.One other suggestion is to more prominently feature SOVTs (semi occluded vocal tract exercises). You reference them in your warm up section (lip trills and straw phonation) but these are highly effective and evidence-based tools to develop efficient phonation.Further, for anyone looking to learn to sing (and anyone can learn to sing!), there's no better resource than a voice teacher.

That doesn't mean it isn't a problem that needed to be solved (nor that it is solved) but that research slows or stops on the other problems.

It got me thinking about the future we’re heading towards, that took me down a rabbit hole.As agents become the dominant code writers, the top concerns for a “working class” programming language would become reducing errors and improving clarity. I think that will lead to languages becoming more explicit and less fun for humans to write, but great for producing code that has a clear intent and can be easily modified without breaking.
