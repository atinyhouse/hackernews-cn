      "abstract": "该讨论围绕xAI并入SpaceX的消息展开，核心争议在于此举的实际动机与技术可行性。部分用户质疑合并的合理性，认为这可能是财务操作，旨在缓解埃隆·马斯克旗下其他业务（如推特债务）的压力，或通过SpaceX“大而不能倒”的地位维系其商业生态。也有用户指出技术层面的困难，特别是太空数据中心面临的散热挑战，认为在太空中保持设备低温极为困难，相关叙述可能缺乏物理依据。讨论中提到，支持方则引用计算数据，设想通过大规模卫星发射实现太空计算能力的突破。整体而言，社区对此事普遍持怀疑态度，多数观点倾向于将其视为财务策略而非技术革新，并对太空数据中心的现实可行性存在明显分歧。",

The company was losing $200MM+ per year on ~$5B in revenue before the takeover, and there are reports that revenues have decreased by round 50%.Best case scenario if we accept those numbers is that X makes $3B per year and about half of that goes immediately out the door in debt payments before paying a cent for the entire business to function.However, if SpaceX acquires X, that ~$1.5B in interest is a fraction of the $8B In profits SpaceX is allegedly generating annually. Further, they can restructure the debt if it's SpaceX's debt, and not owned by X. Investors will be more likely to accept SpaceX shares as collateral than X.",

EVs: Before Tesla, no one thought electric cars could be a mass-market product. And even today, the Model 3 and Model Y are at the top of almost all sales lists.2. Orbital Launch: No one expected Space X to succeed. What does a software guy know about real engineering? But today, re-usable rockets are the way of the future, and Space X is at least 5 to 10 years ahead of any other company.3. Satellite Communications: Every single major military power is trying to deploy their own version of Starlink. Before Starlink, 50 satellites was considered a big constellation. Starlink has 8,000 satellites and they are literally launching hundreds every month.I know it's impossible to prove a counter-factual, but I'm convinced that none of these three would have happened without Elon. No other Western car company has (even now) produced a profitable EV. No other space company has prices as low as Space X. No one even has the capability to build a Starlink competitor (not yet at least). Without Elon pushing these projects, they simply would not have happened or would have happened decades later (after China or someone else beat us to it).Even his not-yet-successful projects are far beyond most other companies:Boring Company has actually built tunnels and passengers are actually riding it. No one else is even trying.Neuralink has actually helped patients.Tesla FSD actually does work (I use it all the time), and even if Waymo is ahead, Tesla is easily in second place.I 100% get the hatred for Elon Musk. His political positions are absolutely worth criticizing and I cringe most of the time he tweets. But to deny his business and engineering ability is just motivated reasoning.Such illusions are ultimately self-defeating. The more opposed one is to Elon Musk (in business or politics) the more important it is to see his capabilities clearly.",

I've been VERY clear in my messaging to HN (on the RCS issue and having ear blown out by iPhone last week) that I am not going to glaze Apple even if the new modems they built interest me. They are usually sort of a neutral to me that has me more pissed off in the recent months than usual. Maybe send me one of your new devices if you don't want me pissed off anymore.As for this location stuff, I'm curious though into how this works and how Apple (and BOOST/DISH) somehow prevent it happening when the big 3 in the US don't. We all know Apple would have complete control over the modem they designed, that's not a surprise. T-Mobile at least it's possible to stay NR-SA connected, it's apparently not a feature limited to SA like resistance to IMSI catchers are. Is this an OpenRAN feature, which Boost uses?At least in the past, towers had a piece of equipment called a LMU that is sometimes installed separately from the radio equipment and it's used for measuring the timing advance to triangulate where a device may be for 911. Here's a reddit thread I started years ago for a KML of all the T-Mobile LMU installs in the NYC market: https://www.reddit.com/r/cellmapper/comments/hq2h7u/kml_of_a... (I just found it leaked, it's not online anymore probably). An FCC doc on LMU's: https://transition.fcc.gov/pshs/services/911-services/enhanc...

          "content": "How that works is simple: there are regulations that force that the microphone used for calling is directly connected to the \"baseband\", which is under control of the carrier. It has to be, because of AT&T's argument: ONE misbehaving baseband can make cell phones inoperable in an area that's up to a kilometer in diameter. So AT&T's cell towers \"need\" to be able to send out a signal that permanently disables a phone's transmitter.Regulations say the baseband MUST control: all wireless signals (including wifi and GPS), all microphones and speakers, and it must be able to disable the camera electrically. It must have a tamper-resistant identifier (IMEI number ... kind of).Oh, it must allow calling the emergency services. If in this mode, during a call to the emergency services it MUST be able to send the exact GPS position (not just once, continuously) to the emergency services at the request of the emergency services (ie. NOT the user, and carriers must facilitate this)By the way, it's worse: as you might guess from the purpose, it doesn't matter if your phone is on the \"spying\" carrier or not, other carriers can send commands to other carriers' phones' basebands (because \"get off this frequency\" is required: spectrum is shared, even within countries. Since phones may go from one tower to another and be required to vacate frequencies, you need this command). It doesn't even matter if you have a SIM in your phone or not (ever tought that if eSIM works, it must of course be possible for any provider to contact and send instructions to the phone, so it opens up an end-to-end encrypted connection to the javacard that the actual phone cpu cannot intercept). In some phones it doesn't even matter if the phone is on or not (though of course eventually it dies). So \"meshtastic\" or anything else cannot make a phone safe.And in practice it's even worse. A lot of phone manufacturers \"save on memory\" and use the same memory chips for the baseband processor and the central cpu. Which means that it's a little bit cheaper ... and the baseband has access to all the phone memory and all peripherals connected through the memory bus (which is all of them in any recent phone). It may even be the case that these chips are integrated in the cpu (which I believe is the case for recent Apple chips). Oh and the regulations say: if there's a conflict over control over (most) peripherals, including the microphone and speaker, the baseband processor MUST be guaranteed to win that fight.Oh and because governments demand this, but of course neither fund nor test these devices, they are old, bug-ridden and very insecure. This also means that despite the government requiring that these features be built into phones, governments, carriers and police forces generally do not have the equipment required to actually use these features (though I'm sure the CIA has implement them all). Not even carriers' cell phone towers: they have to pay extra to allow even just frequency sharing ...Here is an article about baseband and baseband processors.https://www.extremetech.com/computing/170874-the-secret-seco...",

All the various services use various different products for telephony and dispatch but they will show the incoming location, and often will prepopulate an incident with the location.The system that does this is called \"EISEC\" - Enhanced Information Service for Emergency Calls - and has a lot of cool stuff defined in the spec (which is publically available! You can just go and read it! BT offer a \"Supplier's Information Note\" with the protocol and details of how the information is encoded) that also handles calls from landlines. These are easy - your telephone provider knows where you live. OMG! The phone company know where I live? Yes, dumbass, they pulled a wire right into your house, of course they know where it is. For VoIP the situation is a little different but you can notify your VoIP provider of the location that the number is being used at, and it'll inject that into the EISEC request.You can do other cool stuff like if you've got fixed mobile telephone in a vehicle, you can assign the make, model, registration number, colour, and so on in the EISEC database, so given a call from a phone number they know what car they're looking for. No-one uses this.The very great majority of calls coming in to 999 are from mobiles. It's extremely rare to get one from a landline.None of the providers use triangulation for determining where a phone is, it's all GPS.",

I would guess that the solution grew organically given that the UI isn't remotely close to what you'd expect a product manager to want.  We don't know how many internal false-starts there were or how many people were working on other solutions to this problem, but what emerged clearly solved that problem, and can generalize to other problems.In other words, Microsoft seems to have focused on a technology buzzword.  Anthropic let people solve their own problems and it led to an actual product.  The kind that people want.

Claude was actually able to identify bugs and get the bigger picture of the project, while Gemini 3 with Antigravity often kept focusing on unimportant details.My default everyday model is still Gemimi 3 in AI Studio, even for programming related problems. But for agentic work Antigravity felt very early-stages beta-ware when I tried it.I will say that at least Gemimi 3 is usually able to converge on a correct solution after a few iterations. I tried Grok for a medium complexity task and it quickly got stuck trying to change minor details without being able to get itself out.Do you have any advice on how to use Antigravity more effectively? I'm open to trying it again.",

It's kinda hard to remember the context when I come back to a tab. Figure out a way to make it immediately obvious.- Allow me to burn tokens to keep enough persistent context. Make the agent actually read my AGENTS.md before every response. Ensure thew agents gets closer and closer to matching the way I'd like it work as the sessions progresses (and even across sessions).- Add a Replace tool, like the Read tool, that is reliable and prevents the agent from having to make changes manually one by one, or worse using sed (I've banned my agents from using sed because of the havoc they cause with it).",

I chose Astro as the framework because I wanted to learn about it. I fed it some marketing framework materials (positioning statements and whatnot) and showed it some website designs that we like. I then asked it to produce a first cut and it one-shotted a pretty decent bit of output.AGI is definitely a few more years away, because I’ve since invested probably 30 hours of iteration to make the site into something that is closer to what I eventually want to launch. But here’s the thing: I never intended for Codex to produce THE final website. But now I’m thinking, “maybe we can?” On my team, we have just enough expertise and design know-how to at least know what looks good and we are developers so we definitely know what good code looks like. And Codex is nailing it on both those fronts.As I said, we’re far from AGI. There’s no way I can one-shot something like this. It requires iteration with humans who have years of “context” built up.

The key insight from the Recursive Language Models paper is that requirements, implementation plans, and other types of core information should not be part of context but exist as immutable objects that can be referenced as a source of truth. In practice this just means creating an .md file per stage (spec, analysis, implementation plan, implementation summary, verification and test plan, manual qa plan, global state reference doc).I created this using PLANS.md and it basically replicates a kanban/scrum process with gated approvals per stage, locked artifacts when it moves to next stage, etc. It works very well and it doesnt need a UI.

It does not follow instructions. It randomly decides to stop being agentic, and instead just dumps the code for me to paste. It has the extremely annoying habit of just doing stuff without understanding what I meant, making a mess, then claiming everything is fine. The outdated training data is extremely annoying when working with Nuxt 4+. It is not creative at solving problems. It dosent show the thinking. The Undo code does not give proper feedback on the diff and if it actually did \"undo.\" And I hate the personality. It HAS to be better than it comes off for me because I am actually in a bad mood after having worked with it. I would rather YOLO code with Gemini 3 flash, since it's actually smarter in my assessment, and at least I can iterate faster, and it feels like it has better common sense.Just as an example, I found an old, terrible app I made years ago for our firm that handles room reservations. I told it to update from Bootstrap to Flowbite UI. Codex just took forever to make a mess, installed version 2.7 when 4.0.1 is the latest, even when I explicitly stated that it should use the absolute latest version. Then it tried to install it and failed, so it reverted to the outdated CDN.I gave the same task to Claude Code. Same prompt. It one-shotted it quickly. Then I asked it to swap out ALL the fetch logic to have SPA-like functionality with the new beta 4 version of HTMX, and it one-shot that too in the time Codex spent just trying to read a few files in the project.This reminds me of the feeling I had when I got the Nokia N800. It was so promising on paper, but the product was so bad and terrible to use that I knew Nokia was done for. If this was their take on what an acceptable smartphone could be, it proves that the whole foundation is doomed.

The roads were built for horse and buggy and streetcars. Now I have to beg to cross the road. My neighborhood has been effectively chopped up. I question whether I should walk to another block because I'll have to deal with crossing the street. Quiet houses now have the constant buzz of cars either from the ever-present highways or from the 40+ mph traffic right outside their doors. Driverless cars will not solve these problems.

They've proven they can do the rides. But they haven't proven they can do it cost effectively. To scale up and start making a profit, they'll need to start building/buying lots of Waymo cars. That's not going to be cheap or fast. That's going to involve a lot of capital expenses.Tesla is the other way around. They can definitely make lots of cars and make a profit. But they haven't quite gotten FSD to the stage where it can do rides properly. Supposing they at some point figure that one out, they are very well positioned to start producing vehicles by the hundreds of thousands pretty soon after. That's indeed the premise for their valuation. It's risky but not completely without merit.Another point to make is that Waymo and Tesla are not going to have this market to themselves for very long. There are quite a few autonomous ride hailing companies serving rides at this point. And while the attention is often on the US, China is moving pretty quickly as well. Several companies competing there in several huge Chinese cities, for example.On the US side, I think there are a few players that might become competitive soon. Zoox is looking pretty solid. And Rivian is rumored to be pushing autonomy as well. There are a few more players in various stages of technical readiness.The real battle will be in a few years when we are past the basic \"does it work\", \"is it safe\" questions and legal approvals all over the world become more routine.

The general consensus was that we would run the technology platform and private equity would own fleets of cars built and operated to our specification.Waymo has concluded either we are too early in the journey to decouple the tight vertical integration or they want to go very big and own all of the capital expenditure for what will presumably be a global rollout ultimately.For anyone like me with a finance and technology crossover interest I actually think this is as interesting, maybe more interesting, than the private equity play around data centers at the moment because all of that is constrained against chip delivery and power constraints.",

It was really fun for a while, and I enjoyed meeting people from different walks of life. Over time, though, transportation became much more functional for me, and now when I take non-autonomous rides, it's more irksome than enjoyable when drivers strike up conversations.Why the change? I think a big part of your experience is the fact that you \"rarely take taxis.\" Once you're doing it daily or near-daily, the amount of smalltalk becomes more tiresome. Also, with kids and a busy life, I'm usually either looking to get things done or enjoy a rare moment to myself as I'm moving from place-to-place. I agree with OP that Waymo is a huge step up on those dimensions. There's no other human in the same space to feel awkward around.The fact that they drive more safely and smoothly is a huge improvement, as well. Ironically, I thought this was going to be something I would hate about Waymo. \"You mean it drives the speed limit and follows all the traffic laws? It will take forever to get anywhere.\" It took approximately one ride for my perspective to completely flip. It's so much nicer to not feel the stress of a driver who is driving aggressively or jerking to a stop/start at every intersection. It's not like you can tell them to just ease up a bit, either. When we ride with our kids, we feel massively safer in Waymos.Yes, it will be disruptive, and I don't particularly love the dominance that big tech has in all of our lives, but I do think Waymo is a marvel, and I hugely appreciate it as an option. As soon as they can take kids alone to all their various activities, it will be yet another massive unlock for parents.",

Instead of having daily limits, they changed the margin requirements for futures contracts in real-time throughout this move. Futures brokerages calculate margin requirements every second, so what happened was as silver dropped today, the margin requirements got more strict and then people were being liquidated out of their positions immediately. This caused the markets to crash the way we did all day.Previously, what you would see are circuit breakers kick in and the contracts would stop trading for a certain amount of time. You never used to see down 30% days ever, because circuit breakers would limit is. You would see limit down days, and the contracts would stop trading for the rest of the day and then reopen the next day. In the 70s and 80s I think there was a time when some contracts would open at limit down for 15+ days in a row and wouldn't trade for the entire day and people were financially ruined because they couldn't get out of a position for weeks on end.So finding an excuse to sell on top of forced liquidation is what you saw today.

It's noteworthy that the year 1980 because that was when the Hunt brothers tried to corner the silver market. It's often used as an example of the market correcting itself. It's actually a better example of how the exchanges broke the Hunt brothers to bail out the banks.The key event that caused the collapse is sometimes called Silver Thursday [1]. The exchange changed the liquidity rules, forcing a margin call the Hunt brothers couldn't make, forcing a selloff. This was arguably to bail out banks with large short positions in silver.Well, pretty much the exact same thing happened this week when COMEX massively increased the margin requirements [2]. It's worth noting that the market is in a state called \"backwardation\" where the spot prices are higher than future prices. Refiners aren't buying silver, even at the inflated spot price, because of price risk. But also, the COMEX spot price is increasingly being viewed as \"fake\" because foreign exchanges are paying significantly more for physical silver thna the paper COMEX price [3].Basically, this whole thing looks like another GameStop ie a short squeeze. There's not enouugh physical silver to meet contract demands. There's like 300oz of futures silver contracts per 1oz of physical silver.If you followed the original GameStop short squeeze, the price tumbled there too but didn't solve the short squeeze. You even have exchanges closing people's options positions (eg RobinHood) despite them being in the money.Banks still need to cover their significant short positions and it really looks like the exchanges are trying to crash the silver market to do it.[1]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Silver_Thursday[2]: https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2026-01-28/cme-raise...[3]: https://seekingalpha.com/article/4861917-why-silver-prices-i...",

Basically, the entirely silver market is dysfunctional at the moment. And it's all about bailing out banks who are getting wiped out by the silver rally.So when you sell silver at a pawn shop or to a retail dealer, here's what happens in a normal market. You get an instant price, 5-10% off spot hopefully. That dealer then takes that silver and sells it to a refiner in higher volume with a lower margin (to spot). That's their profit. Refiners will convert that silver into bars and sell it to wholesalers and institutional buyers.But instead what's happening is the refiner needs to hold onto the silver for 7-14 days before it gets smelted and processed. With high volatility, they're not paying out the dealers until it's processed and sold. That's a huge cash flow problem. Instead of instant money, it's money in 2 weeks and you have no idea how much money.So the retail dealer has to wait and it could be 20% lower or 20% higher in the current market so instead of 5-10% they eitehr have to offer 30%+ less than spot price if they buy it at all. That money tied up has an opportunity cost.Combine this with a shortage of physical silver to deliver on futures contracts and the refiners aren't really getting the silver they need to satisfy that demand.So the spot price is fake. Nobody's buying anyway. Low wholesale supply means the prices continue to go up. Banks are haemorrhaging money because they have huge short positions. They have to borrow silver to meet their obligations and the silver lease rate (the price to borrow silver for a money has like 10x'ed) and this is where we are.",

Banks hold huge short positions, the prices keep going up, the exchanges are intentionally trying to bail out by the banks by crashing the market and no retailer is actually buying silver for a bunch of reasons I went into more detail about in other comments on this thread.",

Yes, margin requirements change and the exchange tries to protect the market in times of high volatility but increasing the margin requirements significantly means everybody has to put up more collateral even if you're significantly in the black.That's my point: they're intentionally trying to crash the market. The analsysi that they're defending the banks from a short squeeze seems to fit the available data [2].As for China, the government is ensuring their local industries have sufficient silver supply, which is particularly important for solar.The US government has a lot of power to do similar to this but refuse to use it because it would hurt profits. I'm thinking specifically of the Defense Production Act, which could've been used to lower oil and gas prices in 2020-2022. Instead we passed on the costs to consumers, let oil companies export to the world and let them make record profits.[1]: https://www.linkedin.com/posts/ryanlemand_this-chart-is-wort...[2]: https://finance.yahoo.com/news/everything-investors-know-his...",

Nobody has solved this yet.Ultimately, it's the same way you ship human-generated code at scale without causing catastrophic failure: by only investing trust in critical systems to people who are trustworthy and have skin in the game.There are two possibilities right now: either AI continues to get better, to the point where AI tools become so capable that completely non-technical stakeholders can trust them with truly business-critical decision making, or the industry develops a full understanding of their capabilities and is able to dial in a correct amount of responsibility to engineers (accounting for whatever additional capability AI can provide). Personally, I think (hope?) we're going to land in the latter situation, where individual engineers can comfortably ship and maintain about as much as an entire team could in years past.As you said, part of the difficulty is years of technical debt and bureaucracy. At larger companies, there is a *lot* of knowledge about how and why things work that doesn't get explicitly encoded anywhere. There could be a service processing batch jobs against a database whose URL is only accessible via service discovery, and the service's runtime config lives in a database somewhere, and the only person who knows about it left the company five years ago, and their former manager knows about it but transferred to a different team in the meantime, but if it falls over, it's going to cause a high-severity issue affecting seven teams, and the new manager barely knows it exists.

I took a practice test and one of the exercises was listening to 15-30 seconds of audio followed by questions. I did terribly, but it seemed like a good way to practice.

I ran the results by my German teacher and he was impressed.I'm aware of the limitations: Sometimes the audio isn't great (it tends to mess up phone numbers), it can only a small part of my work learning German, etc.The key part: I could have coded it, but I have other more important projects.

I partnered with dozens of teams to support adoption, scale distributed systems, and troubleshoot production issues. Cadence is a key component of Uber's Michelangelo ML platform, and I worked closely with AI/ML teams to integrate it into fault-tolerant pipelines. I also supported internal model training efforts, including fine-tuning LLMs to answer Cadence-related questions and building systems to classify and prioritize developer support.At DoorDash, I contributed to the migration from Django to Kotlin microservices on the Drive Merchant Services team, focusing on customer support endpoints. I also designed and implemented a modular refund rules engine for our largest partners, enabling flexible refund logic and supporting internal tooling.I’ve previously built NLP pipelines at Jobscan to match résumés to job descriptions and score resume strength, and earlier, trained models to predict ad performance based on copywriting—my first foray into ML back in 2016.After wrapping up at Uber, I'm now excited to return to a hands-on engineering role with a collaborative, technically strong team and a path toward engineering leadership (EM or CTO).

I'm looking to manage several embedded devices remotely via Tailscale, but I've hit a major roadblock: the 90-day maximum expiration for Auth Keys. Constantly renewing these tokens is a significant maintenance burden, so I'm searching for a more permanent, 'set-and-forget' solution for my remote hardware.",

From an architecture perspective, I assume it's closer to ZTNAs such as Cloudflare Access and Teleport than to traditional VPNs, even though it operates as one for the clien-based access mode. However, unlike VPNs, it does provide clientless/BeyondCorp access too as it's intended to operate as a more generic/unified access platform (e.g. API/AI/MCP gateway, ngrok-alternative, PaaS-like platform, etc.) rather than just a VPN.",

That’s still network-level trust, even if the login was strong.Zero Trust (architecturally; check out NIST 800-207) changes what identity does:- Identity doesn’t just gate entry\n- Identity + policy decide whether a path exists at all, per service, per session\n- If you’re not authorized for a service, there is literally no route, IP, or port to talk toOn your last point: it’s not “only application-layer,” but it’s also not traditional L3/4 networking. It’s an overlay where identity is bound into connection establishment itself (mTLS/E2EE, service addressing, no inbound listeners), so the network never becomes a trust plane in the first place.That’s the difference between “authenticate, then connect to a network” and “authenticate to create connectivity.”For a reference, check out OpenZiti, thats a project I work on - https://openziti.io/",

I have this on a domain (for convenience), so think something like:hs.mygreatplace.comNow, when I install Tailscale client on any device (phones, tablets, Linux machines, proxmox nodes, etc.), I simply say: don't use the tailscale network for this, please route this over my own network, so you point it to hs.mygreatplace.com as a connectivity server, which is compatible to Tailscale, and that's it. It's officially supported by Tailscale, so that's great and makes it all work.Then, when pairing for the first time, you'll get a link/code, click it and/or enter it on the hub basically (hs.mygreatplace.com) and it's paired.That connection is up and will stay up now. So while that new device may be behind a firewall, I can always connect to it. You open Tailscale and see all your paired devices. They basically now get an additional internal ip (100.0.0.1, etc.) and you use that to ssh or connect to it.I have a beefy Proxmox machine, and used to route many of these services out to the public internet through port mapping, but now I just leave them cut off entirely and only surface them inside of my private network. When connecting to these nodes (from iPhone, Laptops, etc.), there's zero configuration once it is set up, it auto-routes correctly and just acts like those nodes are on the internet, it's a dream.It also automatically adds the node as a subdomain, so if you pair a proxmox node that runs grafana, and maybe has a hostname \"grafana\", it will show up and be always reachable as: grafana.hs.mygreatplace.comIt doesn't get much easier than that.All that said, I HIGHLY recommend Tailscale for anyone who hasn't done much with private networking, just to try out first, and get used to it. Their free tier is very generous and I think they've got a fantastic next-to-zero-config product, truly wonderful. However, my concern was to be trapped with a $160m dollar VC-funded (US-based) company, when the inevitable rug gets pulled (as it always does, and as anyone should come to accept, if you've been on the internet for a minute).So I was looking for alternatives, and headscale immediately worked out. Of course, Tailscale ever killing their client's ability to use your own infra will lead to a similar end result (dead end), but I am sure those things can eventually be sorted out by open source attempts and clients (which headscale has, I just haven't tried them out yet, https://headscale.net/0.25.0/about/clients/).I had a Wireguard network before (which this essentially also is, but in a much nicer packaging), but always ran into config problems with the shared profiles and IPs and so forth, so this was just a simpler step.Worst case, it all goes back to Wireguard.",

Most modern arcade games for instance still rely on a USB dongle to decrypt game files [1], though nowadays they typically also come with an additional layer of TPM-backed encryption as well as always online DRM (many of them are region locked and operate on a revenue share contract, where the owner has to pay a per-play fee to the game manufacturer).These measures typically work well against piracy in the markets the game is officially distributed in (mainly Japan), but end up being cracked anyway once the game is popular enough that foreign arcades and private owners start importing older decommissioned cabinets and create demand for a way to get them running again without depending on the manufacturer's servers.[1]: https://mon.im/2017/12/konami-arcade-drm",

Unlike the assembly trick, this requires 0 programming expertise beyond the ability to type `strings` on the command line.This works because some programs use a hashing algorithm to calculate the key based on the name, do a strcmp, and pop a messagebox if the keys don't match, without zeroizing the valid key buffer first. If the key buffers are on the stack (or if the two mallocs just happen to use the same region in memory), it is often easy to find a valid key if you know where the invalid one is.I guess software that derives keys this way is far less common than it once was, but I know of somebody who cracked something using this method just a few years ago, so it still pops up from time to time.",

Previously, license renewal was managed at the department level which means the users only need to go to their boss if there's an issue and only had to send one email to our local IT to apply a new license. Funding for licenses came out of a special budget so department heads didn't have to beg. Very simple and it worked fine for years. Now, everything is centralized which sounds great except that the people that manage the license server are so far removed from where we are that it can take months for a license renewal. You're not talking to people you have an email address for, you're submitting tickets to our central system where they forward it onto the license group somewhere.

When asked how he verifies the code works, he said he pastes it into a different AI to explain it.That's the \"slopware\" problem in action. The code compiles. It might even work. But there's no understanding of what it's actually doing, no ability to debug when it breaks in production, no awareness of the technical cruft accumulating with every prompt. That's a problem for people creating software for others and is a huge opportunity for software developers to take prototypes and build real stuff.Does anyone remember the RAD days of the 90s?On the flip side, for people making software to solve THEIR problems, they don't need to make anything production quality. Its for a single user, themselves! Maybe the LLMs are good enough now that people don't need to buy or subscribe to software that solves trivial problems as they can build their own solutions. Maybe the dream of smalltalk, hypercard, and even early web where anyone can use the computer of what it was meant for is finally here?",

That's where most of the money was being made b/c if you were a monopoly or oligopoly that each additional unit sold was an absolute increase in revenue and you spread out your fixed costs.What has changed most dramatically is the \"fixed\" cost of writing the software to begin with. Given that the costs were being spread out over so many units beforehand, it's not entirely clear to me how that changes a lot of the economics.For the comments about the \"SaaS vs build your own\", we can use a home services metaphor. Sure, I can do a lot of what my plumber does. But they do it faster, know all of the issues that go wrong with the work and I can pay them a yearly fee to check my boiler to make sure it doesn't fail etc. The time saved by calling the plumber can then be spent with kids, more work or a combo of the two.",

A friend of mine owned an in person and online retailer that was early to the game, having come online in the late 90s. I remember asking him, sometime around 2010, when his Store had become very difficult to use, why he didn’t switch to a more modern selling platform, and the answer was that it would have taken him years to get his inventory moved from one system to another. Modern AI probably could’ve done almost all of the work for him.I can’t even imagine what would happen if somebody like Ford wanted to get off of their SAP or Oracle solution.

You can't just vibe code a client for them – the amount of testing and validation you have to do with your implementation is huge–and if you get it wrong, you are sending the government wrong data, which is a massive legal risk. And then, for some of them, the government won't let you even talk to the API unless you get your product certified through a compliance process which costs $$$. Or, you could just buy some off-the-shelf product which has already implemented all of that, and focus your internal engineering efforts on other stuff. And consider this is just one country, and dozens of other countries worldwide do the same thing in slightly different ways. But big SaaS vendors are used to doing all that, they'll have modules for dealing with umpteen different countries' specific regulations and associated government APIs/file formats, and they'll keep them updated since they are forever changing due to new regulations and government policies. And big vendors will often skip some of the smaller countries, but then you'll get local vendors who cover them instead.",

There needs to be a central authority that is able to lead a defense program.Just one example: I am hearing far too often that France is overly protecting their own interests and as such can't reach important deals with Germany about sharing burdens and profits. So it results in duplicated, incompatible systems. Germany is generally more open to share benefits and intel with other countries.Such deal-making can drag on for decades, to only fall out. For industries to scale, they need long term planning and a guaranteed pipeline of orders.\nI am talking about ships, planes, MBT's, air defence, missile tech--not riffles.It is a shame, because both countries are powerhouses in engineering.

The EU is merely getting dragged down by the established traditional fossil industry that wants to delay the transition as long as possible to squeeze every cent out of the market while they can. But this is bad for literally everyone involved in the long term. The only thing that is benefiting are next-quarter based exec bonuses.

          "content": "Basically all centralization of political power in human history has been accomplished by force. See Rome, Persia, Germany, USSR, etc. etc. etc. Even the USA's transition from a union of united States to The United States occurred under force of arms.Sadly, this centralization of political power has been a disaster for mankind IMO.Even as we've transitioned from monarchies to democracies over the last few centuries, the trend has largely resulted in the replacement of actual, determinative choices with merely having a millionth of a share of a choice. Not a determinative choice, but a say.Consider the holy roman empire, for example. [0]Under this scheme of decentralization, people had an actual choice of their government. Say you were a merchant in Mühlhausen circa 1700, and you found yourself in opposition to your local government. You could simply move a short distance to a different area and be beholdened to an entirely different government. You'd have 50 choices within 100 miles! While it's true that the HRE was all under the administration of one government, but it was extremely weak. It lacked, for example, the ability to levy direct taxes. After unification in 1870, the same merchant would've had to move much further to escape his government, and his options had been diminished by 95%. After European unification, he would have to travel to another continent!While democracy has given us control of our governments in theory, in practice the \"choice\" it offers is much less empowering than the determinative choice afforded by decentralization. The larger our political entities grow, the more diluted our \"say\" and the fewer full choices are available to us. In the United States, we have less than 1/100,000,000th of a share of the choice in our chief executive!While democracy is obviously preferable to Aristocracy/Monarchy/Tyranny, on it's own it is still only a marginal improvement. At worst, you can still end up with 49.9% of people living under a government they oppose. Decentralization solves this lingering problem, because it allows people to self-sort in and out of countries they don't like, allowing for people who truly despise their governments to choose themselves a new government.In the absence of such a safety valve, people are forced into a zero-sum struggle for power. It is rule or be ruled. Dominate or be dominated. We're seeing this in the United States right now. We're not at each other's throats because we hate each other. Not even because we hate each other's politics in the abstract. We're at each other's throats because neither side is content to be ruled by the other.The same reason that centralized entities only arise by force is the same reason they fall apart in the end. People don't want them. They don't want to be dominated.Centralization of political power forces people into an inescapable struggle for power. It is the enemy of peace and tranquility, and a blight on humanity.[0] https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Droysens-26.jpg",

About the only part they might be able to stand on is commerce again, but then so much travel in the larger states remains in the state (ex dallas/houston, san fran/LA) requiring seperate security zones.Bush should have _NEVER_ nationalized them, at least as a private entity they existed in a sorta gray area. Now they are clearly violating the 1st, 2nd, 4th, and 10th amendments.And the solution isn't another bullshit supreme court amendment of the absolutist language in the bill of rights/etc but to actually have a national discussion about how much safety the are providing vs their cost, intrusiveness, etc and actually find enough common ground to amend the constitution. Until then they are unconstitutional and the court makes a mockery of itself and delgitimizes then entire apparatus in any ruling that doesn't tear it down as such.And before anyone says \"oh thats hard\", i'm going to argue no its not, pretty much 100% of the country could agree to amend the 2nd to ban the private ownership of nuclear weapons, there isn't any reason that it shouldn't be possible to get 70%  support behind some simple restrictions \"aka no guns, detected via a metal detector on public airplanes\" passed.

Miller展开，他作为Sudo工具的主要维护者已超过30年。核心话题聚焦于开源基础设施维护者的贡献与可持续性，以及社区对关键工具长期维护的担忧。\n\n讨论中普遍认同Todd是开源领域的传奇人物，有人认为现代互联网高度依赖少数人维护的核心工具如sudo、curl和openssl，这一现状令人担忧。也有用户指出，许多企业虽在生产环境中广泛使用sudo，却未给予维护者足够支持，甚至提议Todd应开设Patreon以获取社区资助。\n\n争议点主要体现在对开源维护模式的反思。有用户提到，开源文化已从早期的“自由软件”理念转向更注重实用性的“开源再分发”模式，并质疑这种趋势的持续性。同时，讨论中提到systemd近期推出了sudo的替代工具run0，引发了关于工具迭代与维护必要性的不同观点。此外，用户对IBM等大公司是否应承担更多资助责任存在分歧，部分人批评企业虽广泛使用却支持不足。整体上，社区在赞赏维护者贡献的同时，也表达了对开源项目长期可持续性的普遍关切。",

I don't like communities were this stuff is big and they always want to run some taxation scheme where they redirect money to their own personal pet projects. It is fortunate that modern tools are good enough to build personal insulation from this stuff.Imagine the farce of Apply HN repeated continuously. Simply awful.",

          "content": "I wonder if a few people going beyond what is reasonable, is representative of open source projects.For a lot of open source projects, if you have a normal day job and spend a few hours per week on a project, then the project just never gets very big. It exists, may have a few users. But on a larger scale, nobody knows it exists.The exceptions are projects where developers spend a lot of time on the project at the expense of a day job. Though there is the possibility that they may have a hard time having a day job in the first place, which may have let to the situation with the open source project.In general, I think we do have a culture problem where we think projects need to be successful. And people working on a project 'need' to support users (who in general don't pay).And that expectation of free work happens throughout the open source ecosystem as well. Distributions expect projects to fix bugs for free. Open source projects expect libraries and compilers to be maintained.Ultimately, change has to come from people who refuse to work for free. Doing something as a hobby for free is perfectly fine. As long as it stays within the scope of a hobby project.",

When you run programs in Termux they run natively on your Android system inside the normal Android sandbox of the Termux app. That has some limitations, for example software has to be compiled to use the paths of the Termux environment. Termux can't just install software into /bin and you can't write into /etc. So everything depending on anything more than the base Android system like dependencies installed by Termux has to be compiled specifically for the paths of the Termux environment. But it also advantages especially when you want a Terminal that is actually part of your Android system. You can just natively access the shared storage for everything Termux has permission to. You can also use the Android API out of Termux – for some things you need to install the Termux:API Addon app – and get stuff like GPS, SMS and contacts.The Android Terminal app is just a view to a full VM.

I ordered the English layout, I received the Spanish one (which is mostly the same but had additional legends for Spanish characters). Le sigh.

Woo!The main keyboard I type on all day at my desk is a Logitech Pebble K380s. It can store three different connection profiles, which can be either Bluetooth or Logi unified receiver. So I have one of those profiles set to connect to my Pixel 8 via Bluetooth (typing from that now). Makes toggling back and forth between that and my desktop very smooth.On a \"real keyboard\" (like this K380s) there's a dedicated Esc key. Most tablet folio cases don't have Esc.

And you can make the default vertical be a scientific calculator now too.Also it does some level of symbolic evaluation: sin^-1(cos^-1(tan^-1(tan(cos(sin(9))))))== 9, which is a better result than many standalone calculators.Also it has a library of built in unit conversations, including live updating currency conversions. You won’t see that on a TI-89!And I just discovered it actually has a built in 2D/3D graphing ability. Now the question is it allows parametric graphing like the MacOS one…All that said, obviously the TI-8X family hold a special place in my heart as TI-BASIC was my first language. I just don’t see a reason to use one any more day to day.",

The paper explicitly states:1. It is acceptable for evaluation of mathematical functions to differ between translation time and runtime.2. It is acceptable for constant evaluation of mathematical functions to differ between platforms.So C++ has very much accepted the fact that floating point functions should not be presumed to give identical results in all circumstances.Now, it is of course possible to ensure that floating point-related functions give identical results on all your target machines, but it's usually not worth the hassle.[P1383]: https://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg21/docs/papers/2023/p13...",

They literally, directly state this as the reason. People inventing technical reasons for why MLX doesn't use ANE are basically just manufacturing a fan fiction. This isn't to say that ANE would be suitable for a lot of MLX tasks, and it is a highly optimized, power-efficient inference hardware that doesn't work for a lot of purposes, but its exclusion is not due to technically unsuitability.Further, the ANE on both my Mac and my iPhone is constantly attenuating and improving my experience. Little stuff like extracting contents from images. Ever browse in Safari and notice that you can highlight text in the image almost instantly after loading a page? Every image, context and features detected effortlessly. Zero fans cycling up. Power usage at a trickle. It just works. It's the same way that when I take a photo I can search \"Maine Coon\" and get pictures of my cats, ANE used for subject and feature extraction. Computational photography massively leverages the ANE.At a trickle of power.Scam? Yeah, I like my battery lasting for more than a couple of minutes.Apple intended ANE to bring their own NN augmentations to the OS and thus the user experience, and even the availability in CoreML as a runtime engine is more limited than what Apple's own software can do.

But if “the market” decides the market can actually signal to government entities that we do indeed need and want more options.Like you actually want to see new apartments in urban cores built without parking garages. Theoretically (and perhaps in practice) these new developments should also be cheaper and less theoretically they give sidewalks and bus routes and tram routes more users and thus more funding and support.

In fact they often work for companies that do legitimate customer support as well, so they maintain the facade of doing “service” for their “clients”.It’s also worth noting that Indian call centers focus more on tech support scams rather than romance scams.[1]: https://www.youtube.com/JimBrowning",

Yes, Windows ships as a single OS—as do the BSDs—but all the components were developed separately.If all they wanted was a service control manager, there were many (better) options already in existence they could have used.",

Systemd has mount units, that you would expect to behave like regular units but for mounts. Except that they don't. You can specify the service retry/restart policy for regular units, including start/stop timeouts, but not for mounts.2. Except that you can, but only if you use the /etc/fstab compat.3.

Systemd has separate behaviors for network and local filesystems.5. One fun example of above, there's a unit that fires up after each system update. It inserts itself _before_ the network startup. Except that in my case, the /dev/sda is actually an iSCSI device and so it's remote. So systemd deadlocks, but only after a system update. FUN!!!6. How does systemd recognize network filesystems? Why, it has a pre-configured list of them: https://github.com/systemd/systemd/blob/4c6afaab193fcdcb1f5a... Yes, you read it correctly. A low-level mount code has special case for sshfs, that it detects by string-matching.7. But you can override it, right? Nope. This list is complete and authoritative.

(https://untested.sonnet.io/notes/web-and-feedback-loops/)That said, some reasons off the top of my head in random order:- seemingly small but UX critical features breaking or not working at all (wake, audio, notifications, scroll breaking).- most of the users don't know/haven't been taught they can install a site or assume that PWAs are inherently worse- PWAs are harder to monetise (no super easy way to let the user pay a lifetime licence for the app, customers want super easy, and that's not for me to judge)- critical, but non-obvious to a non-technical person (and thus difficult to explain) features are unstable or janky on iOS when running standalone/via home screen (example: wiping offline storage every few days).In some ways things work better than, say 10 years ago, but at the same time there's the *unpredictability*. I really don't want to worry about my app breaking in some impossible to fix way next year. Not, when the app is meant to pay my rent.Performance was rarely an issue, discounting experiments like running image recognition inside a \"service worker\" in JS, on iPhone 7 for an AR game I was messing with. That was in 2016 (before Pokemon Go came out and kind... of dumbed down the idea or AR).",

          "content": "Put aside politics and anti-tear gas use cases: everyone should just have a full face gas mask for all hacker-ish activities, like painting. Skip half-face, go for full face. Half face models don't just leave eyes exposed but hurts the back of the neck. Maybe I'm wearing it wrong, but the headstrap for full face is much more comfortable. They also seal a lot better.More random tidbits: You'd semi-obviously want a sacrificial wrap over the mask if you're painting, as well as few spare cartridges. There are particulate filters that are just regular paper masks, organic vapor cans for painting, and couple of acid cans for toxic gases. DYOR and use the right one for the task. Particulate filters go on top of gas cans on the iconic 3M 6000 series masks; it's not integrated to the can. The cans also technically only last few hours after opening the package, so technically you should be replacing twice daily. They also can't protect against large amounts of toxic substances like videogame thick green vapors of alien weapons, only what's somewhat casually filtered. In e.g. inside an active volcano, go for full scuba or something that don't rely on filtering. The reason why some masks use pair of cans as opposed to one can, is just for easier breathing. The performance on paper is the same; you can seal off one port with something if you want. The improvement is maybe not negligible, but you get used to breathing through masks quickly anyway. The mini mask that covers mouth and nose inside a full face mask exists to help clear condensation by forcing you to breathe in fresh air around its front surface and force exhalation through the exhaust valve. Removing it will steam up the shield. The air drawn in is filtered, but exhaust is not; if the wearer is infected with something, the mask won't help stop the spread.TL;DR: gas masks is its own mini rabbit hole.",

Replace after each exposure or 30 days after opening the sealed packaging for best results. A clean shave is important for a good air seal.The absolute best protection would be a PAPR (powered air-purifying respirator) with a TR-6530N filter [1] installed. Something like the 3M Versaflo M-407SG[2] would fit the filter and provide impact resistance. It can be fitted with a Speedglas 9100XXi [3] (or 9100X/V) auto-darkening filter for protection against flashbangs.This is an equivalent PAPR [3] with a better form factor which also includes ANSI Z87.1 rated impact-protection (helpful against projectiles) and auto-darkening lenses (helpful against flashbangs/pyrotechnics). It also still works fine even if you keep a beard. I believe this is part of the Optrel Helix product line, which advertises 14-hour battery life. However, the listing I linked does not come with organic vapor / acid-gas filtration. That requires a different form factor for the filter, the Optrel ABE1P Combination Filter [4] offers A1B1E1P certification (Protects against organic gases/vapors, inorganic gases, acid gases, and particulates)As 'closewith added, \"CBRN\" or \"NBC\" masks are also a good option - they are rated for chemical/biological/radiation/nuclear contamination and are available as riot gear with good impact-resistance. Look for A2B2E2K2-P3 ratings / certification.You could also look into something like the Joseph Leslie Dynamiks A3B3E3K3-rated Jumbo canister for 10000 ppm extended exposure.

So with something like tear gas where you're not worried about actual toxicity per se, I'd think that subjective experience would be fine for knowing when it needs to be changed. If you want to be paranoid, it seems like you could also carry a backup fresh set still in the sealed foil.With the prices for respirators going up (/me gestures at federal \"government\" attacking our own cities), if I wanted to save money I'd get a knock-off full face respirator from Amazon (or Ali if you're comfortable transiting the import blockade with this specific item), and then genuine cartridges (NOT from Amazon obviously, lol).[0] for most things I do, I use the 2097 filters which are primarily particulate with just a small amount of activated charcoal for \"nuisance vapors\".

On the note of matters that didn't seem to come up much in the article, but that I feel like people should know:The kind of cartridge you need to withstand teargas is not an N95, as the top comment points out it's quite a bit more involved. The downside of that other than cost and duration of the filter is that you'll feel a lot more resistance on inhaling than you're used to. For some people the combination of something on their face and the feeling of restricted breathing is unbearable, and mid-tear gas attack is a terrible time to realize that.Consider also that this becomes far more important if you're working hard, say running around or fighting. Anyone who has it in their head to give this a try should keep those factors in mind, as well as get a kit to properly fit-test because again... mid-attack is a terrible time to realize that your fit isn't up to snuff.

It was harder to breathe, more humid, and developed liquid water accumulation over longer periods.I would think that if you did the same thing with a full face respirator, it would immediately fog up.

          "content": "The original Wordle came with a pre-baked ordered list of 2315 \"secret\" words, off which the daily secret word was looked up (I think based on local time). The list was right there in the javascript code of the game (alongside the list of 12972 allowed guess words). It covered dates from 2021-06-19 to 2027-10-20.Then in January 2022, the NYT bought Wordle, and started tweaking both lists, first shrinking the secret word list to 2309 entries, but leaving the logic otherwise intact. Fast forward to today, I looked up the current code [1], and it seems that there are now 14855 allowed words. The first 12546 are ordered alphabetically (0: \"aahed\", 12545: \"zymic\"), and the next 2309 are not. This may suggest that the latter are the secret words, but the logic for picking them has changed: I found no obvious sequence, when compared to the last few days' secret words. So it's either a more complex sequence, or the secret word is picked server-side.In any case, I guess they decided to re-shuffle the list now at day 1689 / 2309 in order to avoid giving particularly assiduous player an additional bit of information: they can exclude all previous secret words.

One LB had \"polymethylmethacrylate\" in its dictionary.I've saved the daily dictionaries from 2024-03-30 and that's the longest word out of the 93 393 total distinct words in the 674 dictionaries I've saved. They average 1199.47 words per dictionary.They have some truly ridiculous words, such as \"troughgeng\". WTF is a troughgeng? Googling that gives a couple of pages in Chinese (or a similar looking language) and a Scottish dictionary entry for \"Throu\" which in one of the examples of \"throu\" as an adverb lists a bunch of phrases is it used in, including:> (8) througang, throw-, throoging, trough-geng, -geong (Sh., Ork.), (i) a going over or through; a passage (I.Sc. 1972); specif. (ii) a narration, a recital (of a story); (iii) a full rotation of crops, a shift; (iv) a thoroughfare, lane, passageway, corridor open at either end (Sc. 1808 Jam.; Sh. 1908 Jak. (1928); Rxb. 1923 Watson W.-B.; Ork., w.Lth., wm.Sc. 1972). Also attrib.; (v) = (5); (vi) energy, drive (Bnff. 1866 Gregor D. Bnff. 192);",

For example, it has a hardcoded maximum receive buffer of 2MiB (separate from the TCP one), which drastically limits transfer speed over high BDP links (even a fast local link, like the 10gbps one the author has).

I should have thought to play more with rclone! I ended up using iSCSI but that is a lot more trouble.>In fact, some compression modes would actually slow things down as my energy-efficient NAS is running on some slower Arm coresDepending on the number/type of devices in the setup and usage patterns, it can be effective sometimes to have a single more powerful router and then use it directly as a hop for security or compression (or both) to a set of lower power devices. Like, I know it's not E2EE the same way to send unencrypted data to one OPNsense router, Wireguard (or Nebula or whatever tunnel you prefer) to another over the internet, and then from there to a NAS. But if the NAS is in the same physically secure rack directly attached by hardline to the router (or via isolated switch), I don't think in practice it's significantly enough less secure at the private service level to matter. If the router is a pretty important lynchpin anyone, it can be favorable to lean more heavily on that so one can go cheaper and lower power elsewhere. Not that more efficiency, hardware acceleration etc are at all bad, and conversely sometimes might make sense to have a powerful NAS/other servers and a low power router, but there are good degrees of freedom there. Handier then ever in the current crazy times where sometimes hardware that was formerly easily and cheaply available is now a king's ransom or gone and one has to improvise.",

          "content": "The parallelism advantage of rclone is real but undersold here. rsync's single-stream design made sense when networks were the bottleneck. Now with high-bandwidth links (especially to cloud storage), the bottleneck is often the round-trip latency of per-file metadata operations.rclone's multi-threaded transfers effectively pipeline those operations. It's the same principle as why HTTP/2 multiplexing was such a win — you stop paying the latency tax sequentially.One thing I'd add: for local-to-local or LAN sync, rsync still often wins because the overhead of rclone's abstraction layer isn't worth it when latency is already sub-millisecond. The 4x speedup is really a story about high-latency, high-bandwidth paths where parallelism dominates.",

It's slightly more efficient, but If you are supporting even 10s of downloads it's a lot of work for the source.The other option is to send just a diff, which I believe e.g. Google Chrome does. Google invented Courgette and Zucchini which partially decompile binaries then recompile them on the other end to reduce the size of diffs. These only work for exact known previous versions, though.I wonder if the ideas of Courgette and Zucchini can be incorporated into zsync's hashes so that you get the minimal diff, but the flexibility of not having a perfect previous version to work from.",

The savings depend on how and where they differ, and ofcourse there's tradeoffs...You seem to be referring to the selection of candidates of files to transfer (along several possible criteria like modification time, file size or file contents using checksumming) [2]Rsync is great. However for huge filesystems (many files and directories) with relatively less change, you'll need to think about \"assisting\" it somewhat (by feeding it its candidates obtained in a more efficient way, using --files-from=). For example: in a renderfarm system you would have additions of files, not really updates. Keep a list of frames that have finished rendering (in a cinematic film production this could be eg. 10h/frame), and use it to feed rsync. Otherwise you'll be spending hours for rsync to build its index (both sides) over huge filesystems, instead of transferring relatively few big and new files.In workloads where you have many sync candidates (files) that have a majority of differing chunks, it might be worth rather disabling the delta-transfer algorithm (--whole-file) and saving on the tradeoffs.[0] https://www.andrew.cmu.edu/course/15-749/READINGS/required/c...[1] https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rsync#Determining_which_parts_...[2] https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rsync#Determining_which_files_...",

Then they added mouse tracking, so we added mouse movement to our scripts.The most insidious part was that it was also an MLM… you would also get paid for usage by people you referred, too, and then even by people those people referred, with diminishing returns from each level. So like 1 cent an hour for my referrals and .5 cents an hour for their referral referrals.We were broke high school kids, so we put so much time and effort into recruiting people and getting them set up with the auto scripts. By the end we were making in the low 3 figure a month. We knew people who were making even more.Of course, it soon went out of business because of the dotcom bust as well as the ridiculous business model and rampant user fraud, but it was fun while it lasted.",

So 10% would be wildly excessive by any measureI see this argument a lot, and I think it's totally bunk.The point of military spending isn't to sacrifice a certain number of goats at the altar to ensure the gods' favor, it's to acquire the means to enforce a nation's interests. In our highly industrial age, that means all sorts of ships, submarines, aircraft, launchers and spacecraft, armed and armored vehicles, autonomous {air, ground, sea, undersea} platforms, all sorts of munitions, deep magazines, production lines, domestic supply chains, etc. etc. etc.The US has spent 3% - 5% of its GDP on its military since 1990, and the US still enjoys the benefits of much of that accumulated spending. Five Nimitz-class aircraft carriers were built even before 1990, when the US was spending 5% - 7% of its GDP on its military. The US still operates B-52Hs, which were built in the 1960's. Even beyond ships and airframes, continued funding of programs and capabilities sustains a sort of inertia of know-how and industrial capability that, once stopped, is difficult and costly to get going again.Just comparing military spending at a snapshot in time isn't a good way to compare military capabilities and potential. If European nations wish to replace what the US brings to the table, it's going to take a crash rearmament program and very high military spending (easily 10%+ of GDP) for a decade or more. And also a unified command structure, unified procurement, and ultimately probably proper federalization. All of which are, unfortunately, pipe dreams.",

Really cool stuff man, thanks for all the improvements you landed in GodotJS!I think most of the people using Godot are not aware how powerful and ergonomic GodotJS actually is. All the intellisense and completion suggestions goodness when using GodotJS is a godsent.Can you tell us a bit more about how making breaka club with GodotJS has been going for you?- Are you using Godot as kind of a rendering frontend while your TypeScript code is rather self-contained and only interacts sparingly with the APIs exposed via GodotJS or is everything deeply intertwined? I'm curious because I'm still looking for a good GDScript replacement. I really dislike GDScript so much :(- How has performance been? I'd imagine V8 with JIT be a lot faster than GDScript and probably within 2-3x of C#? But I guess one wouldn't be able to use V8 JIT on consoles or iOS? I wonder if the performance hit would be tolerable.- Do you still have high-performance code you write with e.g. godot-cpp and if so, how's easy is it to make those things interact?- I saw that there have been thoughts about migrating GodotJS to a GDExtension but it's not easy it seems? Would be a great long-term goal imo because not having to use a custom engine build and instead just plug in a GDExtension would be pretty convenient.- I assume that one cannot use stuff like the node file system API or such things and one has to restrict themselves to JavaScript/TypeScript code that would also run in the browser?Sorry for the flood of questions, no need to answer them all.

Each character could go in any direction they wanted, the group didn't have to stick together. I played it with 5 people.Also played it single player. When I got to the end, it challenged you to make it to the end without a single fight. I made it to that end and it had a congrats screen from Stuart Smith.",

But still, to me, the \"platonic idea\" of Anki seems a dead simple thing. All what I care about when using Anki is what's on the 2 sides of a Card, a question + answer, which can only be some visual image (possibly encoded as text, possibly just JPEG, I really don't care as long as it fits in my mobile device memory) + optional sound. That's really it. If it should be bi-directional or uni-directional card is a detail of how the deck is generated/encoded, and the spaced repetition algorithm is a detail of the app that I use to study (so, usually AnkiDroid, I imagine — an unaffiliated 3rd party; who even uses desktop apps nowadays?).So, I imagine there can exist (and do exist) some minor additional features, like an ability to require a typed answer for a card, but it seems pretty minor, and I really don't see a lot of room for the app to evolve.So, ultimately people need only a common .apkg format, which exists and is relatively simple (although I suppose it could've been even simplier), and a place like AnkiWeb, where people can share their decks, so Spanish top-2000 or basic integrals deck isn't re-invented over and over again. It's a pity that AnkiWeb isn't more open and will be even less open from now on, but as long as someone is willing to just host it (which is ultimately just paying for downloads traffic) it's easy to replicate, so no super-valuable IP here.Of course, a primary use-case for Anki is a tool to make decks, but you could really do with pretty simple python script + YAML/JSON/CSV/whatever metadata file to convert it to AnkiDroid-compatible .apkg file.So, basically, who cares?

Simply recollecting tangential knowledge improves the recollection of a non-sampled factoid, which is hard to model in a strict sense, or perhaps easy for (undiscovered) dedicated analytic models. Having good performing but relatively opaque (high parameter counts) ML models could be helpful because we can treat the high parameter count ML model as surrogate humans for memory recollection experiments and try to find low parameter count models (analytic or ML) that adequately distill the learning patterns, without having to do costly human-hour experiments on actual human brains.",

It's where you download decks- AnkiHub is a third party (started by \"AnKing\", now 35 employees) who sells decks as a monthly subscription and has their content on the deep web (you need to create an account and agree to terms to even see a listing of what's there besides a few featured parts). This is who is getting ownership of the former two. Because they write that Anki will remain open source at its \"core\", I presume that means that things will, at best, stay stable rather than anything (like AnkiWeb the deck sharing platform) becoming open- AnkiDroid is a separate open source project (an Android app).

Best of luck in your future endeavours.With that out of the way, some thoughts:- Anki is in a really good position to work around enshitification. The app, at least to me, is \"complete\" - the only additional features that might pique my curiosity is a different scheduler (at the moment, they're integrating a newer one, although I don't follow enough to know the state of it). Additionally, modern Anki is really well architected: the core of it is a Rust library, that is used by all of the platforms [0]. You can write new front ends using that, or just fork the existing FOSS ones. Maybe dae does a gorhill and gives us Anki Origin.- Really the only service-y part of Anki I use is AnkiWeb, which is basically a backup and sync system. Wonder how that'll evolve (if they do end up charging for it, I hope it is \"Obsidian\" reasonable). EDIT: Ooo, Anki has public server software for running your own version. Awesome! [1]- The idea outcome in my opinion would have been some form of charitable organisation (Linux Foundation?), with people donating to support Anki.- So, AnkiHub is a company that produces Anki flashcards, and they've scaled that quickly? Jeez. Obviously Quizlet proved there was a market for flashcards, but I didn't realise this was possible for Anki.- No outside investment is... hopeful. Not quite sure what indicates that this company has the technical know-how to maintain it.- I've heard too many stories of a maintainer or creative being \"hopeful\" about their new acquirers, only to regret it years down the line.[0]: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46299897[1]: https://docs.ankiweb.net/sync-server.html",

I appreciate the swipe left/right to fail/pass cards on iOS. My one complaint is that the web clipper only works with Chrome and Firefox, but not with Safari (surprisingly).

If there's some agent + prompt that can produce what I wrote, I'd love to learn it—it would've saved me two weekends :)Before addressing your questions further, some context: I'm a developer with no ML background but plenty of Cloud Infra experience. I'm currently building an open-source AI Infra project, which is why I studied nano-vllm. So my writing reflects some gaps in ML knowledge.To your specific points:> it goes into (nano)vLLM internals and doesn't mention PagedAttention onceI didn't find any explicit \"paged attention\" naming in nano-vllm. After reading the first article you linked—specifically the \"Paged KV Caching\" section—I believe the block management logic and CPU/GPU block mapping it describes is exactly what I covered in both posts. It may not be the full picture of paged attention, but I interpreted what I saw in the code and captured the core idea. I think that's a reasonable outcome.> Part 2 will cover dense vs MoE's, which is weird because nanovllm hardcodes a dense Qwen3 into the sourceThis reflects my learning approach and background. Same as point 1—I may not have realized the block design was the famous PagedAttention implementation, so I didn't name it as such. For point 2, seeing a dense Qwen3 naturally made me wonder how it differs from the xx-B-A-yy-B MoE models I'd seen on Hugging Face—specifically what changes in the decoder layers. That curiosity led me to learn about MoE and write it up for others with the same questions.---I completely understand that in this era, people care more about whether what they're reading is AI-generated—no one wants to waste time on low-effort slop with no human involvement.But as I explained above—and as my hand-drawn Excalidraw diagrams show (I haven't seen an LLM produce diagrams with logic that satisfies me)—this is the result of learning shaped by my own knowledge background and preferences.",

I would imagine firms with wind farm contracts would be made whole (i.e. get back lost investment, but not get back potential profit) but it's not a case of the wind farms being given to somebody else or those areas being put to some other use.if you are \"environmental\" you might think it's a great loss not to pursue the wind approach, or that it's a great idea to shut down offshore drilling, but that's political not property ownership/taking.",

But that's not necessarily related to which port is the DFU port.To be clear, DFU (Device Firmware Upgrade) is a standard USB protocol (from 2004!), for a device to receive upgrades from a host. It is a specific port on the mac because that's all the boot-rom can support. This system does not come into play when booting from or upgrading an external disk, as the author was struggling with, because the external disk cannot be a USB Host to drive the DFU.And I'm guessing that the reason macOS doesn't give more details is because macOS is likely not involved in the step that fails (maybe iBoot is?), and they didn't develop a way for the failing step to communicate failure data back to macOS.

It’s a stretch but that’s the main theory I have and would explain why they also sometimes had weird capability mismatches between ports on different sides.Edit: according to ChatGPT that is basically the reason. That one port is connected to the SoC’s building PHY that’s guaranteed to be on without needing any firmware. Other ports are routed through other controllers and whatnot and those may require firmware. Also the DFU port is guaranteed to not need PD negotiation to turn on.DFU could opportunistically try to load firmware and start those devices but it’s risky since the firmware may be what’s bricked and might itself break DFU so for simplicity it’s in an absolutely barebones mode that the CPU supports and is wired for directly.",

(Although it was horribly slow!)Coming back to the author's story, as others have pointed out as well, I do not think it is related to the DFU port itself. I think it depends on the BIOS/UEFI firmware which is addressing those ports, and then the bootloader who is responsible for finding the system (root) volume.Nowadays these happen with Volume UUIDs hence it should not matter, at least in theory. But even GRUB adds a hint, as discovery just with UUID may fail.Since we cannot see what actually is happening or see the logs, I would simply say: \"Always use the same port for booting and installation.\" Which usually simplifies the process.I am quite certain \"the undocumented DFU port\" was the port author initially used to install macOS to the external drive. Maybe on another Mac/machine. When they change the machine, addressing/enumeration of ports may be different, due to how boot process works. Therefore, let's say you used the port=0x3 in the first install, when you change the machine, you need to find the same port=0x3. Thus being the undocumented-DFU-port author mentions.> P.S: Also DFU port is for installing firmware (BIOS/UEFI) to the device even before  boot occurs. For example, you should connect one end of a USB cable to a working computer (ie. \"master\"), another end to the DFU port of target (ie. \"slave\") while the machine that is off. Some specific sequence of power-key combination puts target machine into DFU-mode, where you can overwrite the firmware (UEFI/BIOS, etc) from the working machine... That is the purpose of DFU. -- Or at least access the internal hard-drive/SSD without actually booting the \"slave\" machine.",

Which is why its also USB-C with no Thunderbolt support.Boot ROM code is, by necessity and for robust security, kept to a bare minimum.Bus 0 Receptacle 1 is designated the DFU port in the Boot ROM.Hence the limitation to one port.Widening support to >1 port would mean you would have to introduce extra logic into the Boot ROM code (port iteration, conflict resolution etc.).Hence the K.I.S.S. principle wins.

And you get more storage space than a similarly priced MacBook Pro.Look at the 2025-2026 Lenovo systems. They have haptic trackpads and top tier speakers, features that supposedly only Apple could accomplish.Look at the Framework 13, a computer you can actually repair and upgrade on your own with first class Linux support, from a company that will actually engage with users rather than having a shroud of secrecy.Look at the wide variety of laptops with Nvidia RTX 5000 series graphics, which Apple’s best and most pricey solutions can’t match for performance.Where are the MacBook Pro systems with tandem OLED displays? Why is there still a notch in the middle of the screen especially when there is no Face ID? When is Apple going to refresh the MacBook Pro design that is now almost 5 years old?Look at the Linux desktop, where the development experience is way less janky and compromised than macOS and you can run almost all Windows games after you’re done working, and you can actually customize your system rather than fighting with it. It also doesn’t just randomly get slower because Apple wants to fuck up the UI with Liquid Ass.There’s never been a better time to leave Apple behind. Back in the days of the G4 and G5, Apple users dealt with worse processor performance and efficiency just to use a superior experience.

But computer control allows things that are needed to meet emissions like variable valve timing and whatnot. Also, engines are supposed to detect faults in emissions control systems and throw an error code.So they brought in ECUs, but they DRMed them. Now they said it's so people can't tamper with emissions, but they DRMed everything to the point where now you have to take it to the dealer for servicing.Do they need DRM to prevent people from tampering with emissions? No, they could have ringfenced it like some devices with radio transmitters do. Does DRM in the ECU prevent people tampering with emissions controls? Also no. There are people doing EGR deletes and whatnot on Tier 4 engines all the time.But they were able to use emissions as the wedge to do what they really wanted to do: make their equipment not third-party serviceable.By the way I think this also is a microcosm of the failure of the liberal order. The government should have cracked down hard on manufacturers doing this to begin with. The fact that they allowed manufacturers to turn their customers into serfs \"in the name of emissions\" obviously just ended up discrediting emissions control.",

This is enough to complete most module replacement or upgrade tasks for a hobbyist, and still cheaper than dealership labor costs.There's also a standard for the dongles (which specifies a DLL export interface from a driver, amusingly) called J2534 so you don't need a separate hardware interface for each make, although to your point, the way the laws around J2534 were written was too lax and some manufacturers have realized that there is a loophole where only certain diagnostic tasks like module reflashing need to be possible over J2534.Also worth noting that reverse engineered software has generally not been majorly threatened by manufacturers in the automotive space; Forscan for Ford, VCDS and OBD11 for VW, and so on are all quite popular.Unfortunately \"security\" restrictions especially in the EU and the uprise of ADAS systems has made things a lot harder; most makes now have some online challenge/response cryptography (ie VW SFD) for diagnostics where previously they had offline login, and most ADAS and camera systems require extremely expensive calibration jigs (this is a valid technical problem, but with no incentive to reduce cost or make these systems accessible, they end up being comically expensive).Anyway the situation in automotive is way better than the situation in equipment and ag, so I don't think it's entirely fair to say that regulation was a complete failure.",

Removing the initial motivation / excuse isn't going to get rid of those digital restrictions, openly document the systems, nor provide the tools required to work on them.The way this is framed, it doesn't even sound like the goal is to affect this dynamic at all. Rather it's to create a loophole of \"temporarily\" bypassing emission systems, such that if you delete and get caught you can just pinky swear that it's temporary for a repair that you're about to complete real soon. So the only real goal seems to be implicitly rolling back emissions enforcement across the board.Actual right to repair action would focus on making it so individuals are able to self-repair the emissions control systems to function as designed.

Under federal law 40 CFR § 89.1006, the penalty for a dealer who removes or renders inoperative emissions controls is subject to a penalty of $32,500 for each violation. Wareham says that one manufacturer of chipping software was initially fined $300,000 by the EPA and then $6 million to ensure future compliance with the Clean Air Act. “The EPA has stated that their intent is to crack down on defeat devices in 2020,” says Wareham.> A dealer may face liability issues when customers tamper with the equipment they purchased, even if a dealer had nothing to do with the modification. For example, in instances in Ohio and Oregon, customers were injured as a result of modifications and dealers were sued.",

The tractor owner sustained injuries and then sued both the manufacturer and the equipment dealer, alleging that his injuries were the result of negligence on the part of the manufacturer and dealer. Remember, neither the dealer nor the manufacturer were involved in the turbochargers installation.”-----------------------This is such a weasley disingenuous argument. First of all, it was a guy's insurance company that sued the tractor manufacturer and the supercharger manufacturer. The guy filed an insurance claim, the insurance company is just suing anyone they can possibly imagine to try to make the quarterly results better.It was also dismissed under summary judgement because the case is ridiculous on it's face. This was not a case where restricting the right to modify things you own based on possible harm to a corporation was justified.Quite the opposite, this is a case where a greedy insurance company made a really stupid hail-mary lawsuit to try and recover from a legitimate insurance claim.The fact that we're repeating this blatant corporate propaganda is frankly embarrassing.https://www.govinfo.gov/content/pkg/USCOURTS-ohnd-1_12-cv-01...",

If the paradigm is identical and the entire purpose would be \"haha it is now one language,\" surely you could just compile and link the C code with libzigc...
