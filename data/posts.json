      "abstract": "该讨论围绕特朗普宣称委内瑞拉总统马杜罗在军事打击中被捕的消息展开。核心争议在于美国单方面行动的合法性与后果。有人认为马杜罗是独裁者，其下台可能有利于地区稳定，但强调美国无权决定他国政权更迭。也有用户指出，这种未经正当程序的跨境抓捕行动破坏了主权原则，可能引发全球不稳定，甚至为大国侵略行为提供先例。讨论中提到，许多委内瑞拉民众对马杜罗统治不满，但同时对美国干预方式感到不安。部分用户将此次行动与过去的反恐战争类比，批评美国政府重复错误且缺乏现实认知。此外，有观点担忧此类事件可能鼓励其他强国效仿，例如中国对台湾的潜在行动。社区普遍认同主权应受尊重，但对如何平衡人道干预与国际法则存在明显分歧。",

We're back in the 70s.There is ZERO concern of the current US administration about the welfare of Venezuelans, its a power play, if maduro played by the US rules, he would be in power regardless of crimes.

That's not intended as hyperbole, if anything it's an understatement.Because, it's not going away: You can talk all you want about how IPv6 should have been a more straightforward expansion of the address size, but this is all in the rear-view mirror at this point. IPv6 is going to be with us forever, you may as well get used to it. It's already everywhere in 5G deployments, ISP's like Comcast use it for 100% of their out-of-band management, China is making huge progress moving to it as part of their 5-year plan, India is progressing nicely in their transition, the list goes on. We're already way too far along in the transition to abandon it in favor of something else.But it's not going to happen any quicker than we've seen, either: There's no urgency (no \"must-have\" use case) except for what organizations are imposing on themselves. Yeah, IPv4 addresses are more expensive, but you don't really need many of them as a business (you can get by with a small handful of public ones, and just using L7 load balancers and SNI for everything) nor as an ISP (CGNAT can get you a long way.)So we have a situation where things are migrating very slowly, mainly only in places where it makes sense (mobile deployments, home ISP's where the users don't actually administer the network), and generally mostly for new deployments. This is a recipe for IPv4 to be around for a very, very long time. We're used to technology moving at breakneck pace, but that's only the case for the higher-level stuff. The core infrastructure like the internet protocol is likely the textbook example of slow-and-steady, and a case where it's actually not crazy to think of centuries-long timeframes for things.[0] Barring any unforeseen black-swan events like a world war destroying all technology and having to rebuild from scratch or something.

Example of these invisible world items are motors, servos, PLCs, and label printers that get configured over IP. These devices do the bare minimum to get the IP stack up and running. These UI tools also need to be updated for allowing configuring an IPv6 address.I would love to leave IPv4 and move fully to IPv6. Currently it is not cost effect to do so at scale. Companies do not want to spend money on the extra hardware to allow their IPv4 devices to talk IPv6 when they can save that money and keep running IPv4. Nor do they want to spend money on newer hardware.

Add an IPv4+ box on the network, assign it the DMZ address, and have it hand out public IPV4+ addresses and NAT them to the local IPv4 private subnet.IPv6 seems to be a standard that suffered from re-design by committee. Lots of good ideas were incorporated, but it resulted in a stack that had only complicated backwards compatibility.

We don't know it because we've never needed to know it, and we've never needed to know it because it's not really required for anything (i.e. the cost of adopting/learning it > benefit).This has been a frustrating HN discussion to read, to be honest, because the consensus view strikes me as so off base. It's not that IPv6 has been miscommunicated, or that it hasn't been taught enough to undergrads. It's that it has been designed with virtually no incentives to encourage people to actually adopt it, with the entirely predictable consequence that no one adopted it. Therefore, none of us need to know it, schools don't need to teach it, etc.Folk are internalising the wrong lesson here. Incentives matter. No amount of mandated IPv6 instruction or well-intentioned blog posts explaining IPv6 are going to change anyone's incentive structure. And then when those things fail, there's a predictable and tiresome tendency to blame the users for not switching.If you want people to adopt new tech, make it actually do something new.

It's not just a thinking shift.IPv6 isn't all that complicated for most common use cases. Its fundamental concepts and rules are simple. It also obviates the necessity of the complicated workaround called NAT, without which IPv4 is impractical these days.It's more like the imperial vs metric system debate. If the world hadn't seen IPv4, I believe that we'd all be using IPv6 without any complaints. The real problem is that IPv6 isn't taught well.> Separate from that, deliberate decisions were made to make it a \"clean slate\" without consideration for existing ipv4 hosts. Guess they were hoping the separate stacks would go away eventually, but in hindsight, no way.I'm not sure what to make of this. The presence of the IPv4 stack isn't what blocks the adoption of IPv6 - at least not technically. They can coexist on the same host and function concurrently without interfering with each other. It was designed to operate like that. The actual blocker is the attitude that people hold towards IPv6 - \"We have IPv4 that works already. Why should we care about an alternative?\". You can see that expressed on this discussion thread itself.There is one crucial detail that the IPv6 detractors neglect - the scarcity of IPv4 addresses means that IPv4 address blocks are now heavily coveted and therefore subject to moneyed interests. That isn't very good for the health of the open internet, digital rights and equity. They're thinking about individual trees and losing sight of the whole damn forest.

Then we got DS-Lite. Which, because IPv6 wasn't designed to do that, adds a tremendous amount of complexity.Will we eventually get to an IPv6 only future? We have to. There is no alternative.

You get a public /48 IPv6 prefix that allows for 16 bits of subnets and then the host addresses can just start at 1 if you really want. So addresses can be prefix_1_1 if you want. And the prefix is easy to memorize since it never changes.I DO think using 64 bits for hosts was stupid but oh well.",

This is already the case with Denmark and Sweden as these ships need to cross Öresund or Great Belt strait to reach the Atlantic.However, this act would, in my understanding, give much more power to Finland and Estonia to detain these ships, and charge the crew for the crimes they have committed. Right now there seems to be a loophole in the legislation that Russia is actively exploiting for hybrid warfare purposes. If the strait rules would give Russia more ways to cause harm, some other way of dissuading Russia from making these acts should be done.In general though, it feels stupid that we have to play by these rules, when the enemy makes a mockery of them and actively tries to exploit them to cause as much harm as possible. But that's the reality when bordering Russia.",

Give me a break.While your sentiment may be correct in 2010s it certainly was not when these things were being decided in early 90s. USSR and Russia which de facto ruled it was seen as a failed state that needs \"western help\" and on a path to democracy. While we (here in Poland) we're quite skeptical, having the Russian WW2 occupying force leave in 1991 (yes, we didn't get freedom after WW2 until 1991). There was still a lot of hope Russia will follow in the footsteps of other central/eastern European countries like Poland/Czech/The Baltics if only we help them. So yes, there was huge resentment, but also a huge benefit of hope and benevolence too.Was some of this calculated? Sure. No doubt someone sat in Talin and Helsinki and thought: if we treat them like post WW1 Germany it will be easier for the  extremists to take power. So let's not pour sand in their fuel tank as they are desperately trying to restart the engine of their economy.I don't even think it was a mistake at the time. It was a decent way to behave. But the moment the tide has started turning in Russia towards autocracy the screw should've been tightened. No oil and gas should fund Russian army after at least their attack on Georgia. If not before when the atrocities of the Chechen war became known.Unfortunately corrupt politicians (that are still in power in Europe and even in my country) have continued signing deals and making money by financing what was clearly a huge enemy in the making.Russia wasn't an eny in 1993, but it certainly was one in 2008 when it invaded Goergia. If only we acted properly in early 2000s all of this could've been prevented.",

But it is hard to argue against the value of current AI, which many of the vocal critics on HN seems to have the opinion of. People are willing to pay $200 per month, and it is getting $1B dollar runway already.Being more of a Hardware person, the most interesting part to me is the funding of all the developments of latest hardware. I know this is another topic HN hate because of the DRAM and NAND pricing issue. But it is exciting to see this from a long term view where the pricing are short term pain. Right now the industry is asking, we have together over a trillion dollar to spend on Capex over the next few years and will even borrow more if it needs to be, when can you ship us 16A / 14A / 10A and 8A or 5A, LPDDR6, Higher Capacity DRAM at lower power usage, better packaging, higher speed PCIe or a jump to optical interconnect? Every single part of the hardware stack are being fused with money and demand. The last time we have this was Post-PC / Smartphone era which drove the hardware industry forward for 10 - 15 years. The current AI can at least push hardware for another 5 - 6 years while pulling forward tech that was initially 8 - 10 years away.I so wished I brought some Nvidia stock.

It appears that the best possible tool for any situation is Bash—if your agent can run arbitrary shell commands, it can do anything that can be done by typing commands into a terminal.I push back strongly from this. In the case of the solo, one-machine coder, this is likely the case - if you're exposing workflows or fixed tools to customers / collegues / the web at large via API or similar, then MCP is still the best way to expose it IMO.Think about a GitHub or Jira MCP server - commandline alone they are sure to make mistakes with REST requests, API schema etc. With MCP the proper known commands are already baked in.

Kind of like the Morris worm running amok as an experiment gone wrong, I think we will sometime soon have someone set up an AI agent whose core loop is to try to propagate itself, either as an experiment or just for the lulz.The actual Agent payload would be very small, likely just a few hundred line harness plus system prompt. It's just a question of whether the agent will be skilled enough to find vulnerabilities to propagate. The interesting thing about an AI worm is that it can use different tricks on different hosts as it explores its own environment.If a pure agent worm isn't capable enough, I could see someone embedding it on top of a more traditional virus. The normal virus would propagate as usual, but it would also run an agent to explore the system for things to extract or attack, and to find easy additional targets on the same internal network.A main difference here is that the agents have to call out to a big SotA model somewhere. I imagine the first worm will simply use Opus or ChatGPT with an acquired key, and part of it will be trying to identify (or generate) new keys as it spreads.Ultimately, I think this worm will be shut down by the model vendor, but it will have to have made a big enough splash beforehand to catch their attention and create a team to identify and block keys making certain kinds of requests.I'd hope OpenAI, Anthropic, etc have a team and process in place already to identify suspicious keys, eg, those used from a huge variety of IPs, but I wouldn't be surprised if this were low on their list of priorities (until something like this hits).",

Simon's observation that coding agents need reliable tool calling that local models can't yet deliver is accurate - but it frames the problem purely as a capability gap.There's a philosophical angle being missed: do we actually want our coding agents making hundreds of tool calls through someone else's infrastructure? The more capable these systems become, the more intimate access they have to our codebases, credentials, and workflows. Every token of context we send to a frontier model is data we've permanently given up control of.I've been working on something addressing this directly - LocalGhost.ai (https://www.localghost.ai/manifesto) - hardware designed around the premise that \"sovereign AI\" isn't just about capability parity but about the principle that your AI should be yours. The manifesto articulates why I think this matters beyond the technical arguments.Simon mentions his next laptop will have 128GB RAM hoping 2026 models close the gap. I'm betting we'll need purpose-built local inference hardware that treats privacy as a first-class constraint, not an afterthought. The YOLO mode section and \"normalization of deviance\" concerns only strengthen this case - running agents in insecure ways becomes less terrifying when \"insecure\" means \"my local machine\" rather than \"the cloud plus whoever's listening.\"The capability gap will close.

The last time we have this was Post-PC / Smartphone era which drove the hardware industry forward for 10 - 15 years. The current AI can at least push hardware for another 5 - 6 years while pulling forward tech that was initially 8 - 10 years away.It’s very unclear how much end-consumer hardware and DIY builders will benefit from that, as opposed to server-grade hardware that only makes sense for the enterprise marker. It could have the opposite effect, like hardware manufacturers leaving the consumer market (as in the case of Micron), because there’s just not that much money in it.",

Having lived through the time when web pages were served through CGI and mobile phones only existed in movies, when SVMs where the new hotness in ML and people would write about how weird NNs were, I feel like I've seen a lot more concrete progress in the last few decades than this year.This year honestly feels quite stagnant. LLMs are literally technology that can only reproduce the past. They're cool, but they were way cooler 4 years ago. We've taken big ideas like \"agents\" and \"reinforcement learning\" and basically stripped them of all meaning in order to claim progress.I mean, do you remember Geoffrey Hinton's RBM talk at Google in 2010? [0] That was absolutely insane for anyone keeping up with that field. By the mid-twenty teens RBMs were already outdated. I remember when everyone was implementing flavors of RNNs and LSTMs. Karpathy's character 2015 RNN project was insane [1].This comment makes me wonder if part of the hype around LLMs is just that a lot of software people simply weren't paying attention to the absolutely mind-blowing progress we've seen in this field for the last 20 years. But even ignoring ML, the world's of web development and mobile application development have gone through incredible progress over the last decade and a half. I remember a time when JavaScript books would have a section warning that you should never use  JS for anything critical to the application. Then there's the work in theorem provers over the last decade... If you remember when syntactic sugar was progress, either you remember way further back than I do, or you weren't paying attention to what was happening in the larger computing world.0. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VdIURAu1-aU1. https://karpathy.github.io/2015/05/21/rnn-effectiveness/",

It's insulting then for professionals to see manga PFPs on X put some slop together and say \"movie industry is cooked!\". It betrays a lack of understanding of what it takes to make something good and it gives off a vibe of \"the loud ones are just trying to force this objectively meh-by-default thing to happen\".The other day there was that dude loudly arguing about some code they wrote/converted even after a woman with significant expertise in the topic pointed out their errors.Gen AI has its promise. But when you look at the lack of ethics from the industry, the cacophony of voices of non experts screaming \"this time it's really doom\", and the weariness/wariness that set in during the crypto cycle, it's a natural tendency that people are going to call snake oil.That said, I think the more accurate representation here is that HN as a whole is calling the hype snake oil. There's very little question anymore about the tools being capable of advanced things. But there is annoyance at proclamations of it being beyond what it really is at the moment which is that it's still at the stage of being an expertise+motivation multiplier for deterministic areas of work.

The top recommendation was to revert to Mojave.Finally, after three days of struggle, I gave up and installed Linux Mint.The difference is absolutely unbelievable. Even heavy applications like LibreOffice and Zoom are snappy.Apple makes such good hardware.

I mained Windows for the last few years and got to the point where I was comfortable doing development similarly to how I would on Linux (text editor and command line build tools, cl, ml64, batch, etc.). I did that mostly so I could game and develop on the same machine. I learned a ton doing it but it has just gotten too awful to carry on.It was faster to rg to search files, drop into WSL and run find for file name searches. The start menu was laggy, explorer was laggy (open up a folder with a couple dozen OGG files and it won't render for a solid minute). Mystery memory usage from privileged processes I had little control over. Once I realized that the one game I play (Overwatch) ran on Linux I decided to swap back.I installed Linux Mint earlier this year and I've been extremely happy. The memory consumption is stable and low, and if something is broken I have the control to fix it. It just feels so much less hostile. This is largely possible thanks to the work Steam has done with Proton. The last real barrier is kernel level anti-cheat which prevented me from trying out this years Call of Duty. Oh well!",

Last year, when I was asked to share the screen during a daily, I had to say \"um, I'm sorry, Zoom and desktop sharing don't work on my system.\"But I thought I'd first do a test on my workstation, just to see if maybe I shouldn't be concerned anymore. I was sceptical.The ideal scenario was that on my standard GNOME 48 / Wayland / PipeWire desktop I'd be able to use Firefox for this call, and AirPods, a Logitech webcam, and desktop sharing (5K ultrawide scaled at 125%) would just work with no tweaks whatsoever.And it did!I've been using Linux on the desktop for over 20 years (on and off, but mostly on) and I know how to hold my Linux systems, but the situation with Bluetooth audio and desktop sharing in previous years has been... spotty. I was less worried about AirPods — I switched to PipeWire ~3 years ago and so I know Linux audio has been rock-solid and pretty much solved already. But desktop sharing used to be hit-or-miss, highly dependent on whether you used X11 or Wayland, further complicated by the use of Flatpaks.Since my test went well, I did the interview on the desktop machine.

I don't see ads from MS at all, though- sometimes my vendor driver-management software asks me if I was to extend my warranty. Not Win11 fault, though. Start menu seems fine, phone integration is nice, OS runs very stable (in the very early days of using Linux 20y ago I marveled at how much more stable it was than Win98!

I don't see CandyCrush or other random things added to my machine. All seems OK.I've read that Win12 will be subscription-based. Maybe I am personally already there. For now, M365 offers me good value- I use MS Office and OneDrive.

      "abstract": "该讨论围绕\"家长控制功能是否真正服务于家长需求\"展开。用户普遍认为现有系统存在明显缺陷，如XBox和Switch等平台的控制功能不完善，无法有效屏蔽不适宜内容或限制免费下载。多数人认同家长控制不应替代家长自身的风险评估责任，但当前工具确实难以满足实际需求。\n\n讨论中形成的主要分歧在于解决方案：有人认为应由非营利组织牵头制定统一标准供开发者遵循；也有用户指出不同年龄段儿童需要差异化管理策略，对10岁有效的方法对15岁可能不适用；还有家长分享通过开源项目或全程陪同等替代方案。值得注意的是，部分用户批评原文作者立场矛盾，既抱怨孩子接触网络又要求在线服务功能。\n\n社区共识在于现有商业平台的家长控制功能设计粗糙，未能充分考虑真实使用场景。同时大家认识到完全依赖技术控制并不现实，随着孩子年龄增长，同辈影响会逐渐削弱家长控制效果。",

Only so much can happen in, say, 2-3 30 minute sessions throughout the day, and the chances of a kid deciding to blow their precious minutes responding to some random person seems much lower than if bored and checking messages idly. Being nearby during a healthy sample of sessions to have a pulse on what's going on helps too - usually pretty obvious what they are doing.But I share the frustration of the author with how unreliable the controls are. Apple screen time controls routinely stop working - especially the one that only allows access to a finite list of websites. I need to check the browser history every week or so to confirm it is still working, and do some dance where I turn off controls, reboot, then turn back on every once in a while. The reason this particular control is important to me is that, even starting with something as pure as neil.fun, ads on that site have proven to be a few clicks away from semi-pornographic sites - it's terrible! And yet, turning off all internet access is such a coarse decision that limits access to things that are generally informational / fun / good (like neil.fun, or sports facts sites).",

I discovered that if I ran the Prodigy installer it would connect to the Internet briefly to download the latest phone numbers in my area.  I found that I could alt-tab out of the full screen installer and use the lnternet unfiltered for about 10 minutes or so before they kicked me off.  This worked for about a year or so.I then had to resort to stealing my parent’s credit card and signing up for free trials and cancelling them before the charges incurred.  I eventually screwed up big time.  I downloaded a “free porn” BBS dialer and it made an international call to South America and ran up the phone bill $300 or so. I lost my computer privileges for a couple of months.  I guess the silver lining was when I turned 16, I immediately got a job and my drivers license so I could pay for my own phone line. I kept my grades up to maintain privileges and was a straight arrow since.",

          "content": "The main point of childhood is to develop a solid basic humanity with good habits and a good moral compass. That means moral, intellectual, spiritual, and physical development. Good parenting and a good social environment support these. As such, these goods should be prioritized.We know that children and teenagers are vulnerable to all sorts of filth that the internet makes available very easily, and indeed even inflicts without consent onto users. Porn, for example, was something that was more difficult to encounter before the internet, and when you did encounter it, it was in smaller amounts. Today, you are a URL away from an unlimited sea of it, and the ubiquity of mobile devices means restricting access is difficult. This makes parenting more challenging. And that's a more pernicious even if common problem. Social media and SFV cause all sorts of developmental harm without suffering the same stigmas as pornography or violence, and so its use continue with the full approval of the social environment.(And age range here is not so important to discuss; pornography consumption and social media/SFV use is bad for everyone, including adults.)> Be aware of unintended consequences when you (try to) cut a child off from computer use.A corollary of what I wrote about is that you have to understand what matters. Becoming a \"hacker\" isn't the priority of childhood, and it's odd to prioritize that. It isn't worth anything if you are left screwed up by consuming bad content. (Nor does most of the most fruitful experimentation require constant and unfettered internet access. Without maturity and discipline, the internet easily becomes an enabler of shallow and superficial engagement. Deeper exploration is often best facilitated by disconnecting.) It's also senseless to appeal to exceptions.However, I do think that the most important factor isn't parental controls, but the family environment, what parents teach their children, and the social groups your family and your children move around in. If parents are relying on technology as a substitute for their job as parents, then children will easily fall prey to all sorts of trash. But if children have parents who communicate clearly what they should and should not be doing, maintain a healthy and active family life, and model good behavior by example while penalizing bad behavior, then children will generally stick to good behaviors.I think law has an important role to play. The former should support the latter. And more fundamentally, this requires a certain backtracking from the anything goes/do what feels good ethos of the contemporary moral landscape. Moral confusion is the biggest factor. Law is effectively a determination of general moral principles within certain socially and culturally concrete circumstances. As the old expression goes, lex iniusta non est lex (an unjust law is not a law). The point of the law is to guard the common good (which is what makes a society) and help steer people away from the bad and toward the good. We all need these to live good lives, and we need to finally put to rest the pernicious notion that the law is not about moral guidance and that all it exists for is to secure our \"rights\" to whatever we want, where the understanding of rights entails a  destructive do what thou wilt relativism. True freedom is not the ability to do whatever you damn well please. It is the ability to do what is good, and to be able to do the good, one must be virtuous - a proper formation - that enables you to be good. Vice cripples our ability to be. A legal system and a society that is supportive of virtue and the good is good for its individual members. One that embraces a bullshit \"neutrality\" is an easy target for predatory exploitation. There is a great deal of money to be made from vice and stupidity. We become morally defenseless in the face of the wolves. Might becomes right, and in a culture of moral relativism, we internalize this tyrannical false principle.",

This single fact opens the floodgates to noise, spam, and irrelevance at an unprecedented scale.The core problem is that the average consumer cannot easily distinguish between these two fundamentally different universes. Loud, low-effort content often masquerades as significance, while quiet, honest, and carefully produced work is overlooked.

Plus a personal \"profile\" page [3]. Both blogs only have one post, the first one perhaps a couple of drafts I never got around polishing to publish them. The personal page I still have to update after quitting a PhD months ago.Why is this? Is it due to some lack of self discipline? Is it because, if I write why I quit a PhD, I would end up complaining about the current status of academia, and this could be at odds with my current employer's guidelines about posting on social media? Or is it because, if I stop and list all the things I have in the back of my mind that would require \"just half an hour a day\", I would end up filling a whole day?

Sure, you wanted lots of people to read your blog, but we did have an era when posting didn't implicitly ask: how big is your following, how well did this travel, did it work.Today, the \"successful\" participants (the successful audience-builders) are called \"creators\", while everyone else (who is also creating, just without large-scale traction) is categorized as lesser or invisible. You can write a blog post, a tweet, a Reddit thread; you have undeniably created something.

And because it's work, and it's optional, you sort of have to feel like it's \"the work you should be doing,\" or at least part of or ancillary to, \"the work you should be doing,\" or else it will just feel like busywork, and/or get postponed indefinitely. Posting on an existing platform is lower-stakes. But then again, if you end up putting lots of effort into posts on an existing platform, you're still doing most of the work, and one could infer that you care about it at least that much. In those cases I would recommend doing the initial setup of an actual blog etc., which is just a one-time operation pretty much.",

Its only if you go through the exercise of understanding why people use them, and what it would take to replicate them, that you can understand what it would actually take to improve them. For example, the fundamental feature of facebook is the network. And layered on, the ability to publish short-stories on the internet and have some control over who gets to read it. The technological part is hard but possible, and the network part well - think about how they did it originally. They physically targeted small social groups and systematically built it over time. It was a big deal when Facebook was open to my university, everyone got on about the same time, and so instantly you were all connecting with each other.I believe we can build something better. But I'm also now equally convinced that it's possible the next step isn't technological at all, but social. Regulation, breaking up the monopolies, whatever. We treat roads and all manner of other infrastructure as government provided; maybe a social platform is part of it. We always lean these thoughts dystopian, but also which of us technologically inclined readers and creators is spending as much time on policy documents, lobbying, etc, as we are schlepping code around hoping it will be a factor in this process. This is only a half thought but, at least these days I'm thinking more about not only is it time to build, but perhaps its time to be building non-code related things, to achieve what we previously thought were purely technological outcomes.",

The irony is that he knows nothing about AI, how to build capable models or how to build useful AI products, nor does he have people who do.

I went back home 2 states away, and expected a call from them to \"put it back to what it was\", but it never happened. (The closest was Mom wondering why solitare (the gnome-games version) was different, then guided her on how to change the game type to klondike.)If \"it [Xubuntu] works like Windows\" offended you, I'd like to point out that normies don't care about how operating system kernels are designed. Normies care about things like a start menu, and that the X in the corner closes programs. The interface is paramount for non-technical users.A family friend recently called me for advice on her old decrepit laptop. I told her about my work \"laptop\": a Surface Pro tablet with Linux.

It stuns me as much as when Encyclopædia Britannica stopped selling print versions a mere 9 years after the publication of Wikipedia, but at an even faster timescale.- I disagree with most comments that the brusque moderation is the cause of SO's problems, though it certainly didn't help. SO has had poor moderation from the beginning. The fundamental value proposition of SO is getting an answer to a question; if you can the same answer faster, you don't need SO. I suspect that the gradual decline, beginning around 2016, is due to growth in a number of other sources of answers. Reddit is kind of a dark horse here, as I began seeing answers on Google to more modern technical questions link to a Reddit thread frequently along with SO from 2016 onwards. I also suspect Discord played a part, though this is harder to gauge; I certainly got a number of answers to questions for, e.g., Bun, by asking around in the Bun Discord, etc. The final nail in the coffin is of course LLMs, which can offer a SO-level answer to a decent percentage of questions instantly. (The fact that the LLM doesn't insult you is just the cherry on top.)- I know I'm beating a dead horse here, but what happens now? Despite stratification I mentioned above, SO was by far the leading source of high quality answers to technical questions. What do LLMs train off of now? I wonder if, 10 years from now, LLMs will still be answering questions that were answered in the halcyon 2014-2020 days of SO better than anything that came after?

When you have a library of every question asked, at some point, you asked most of the easy questions. Have a novel question becomes hard.\n- This graph is using the Posts table, not PostsWithDeleted. So, it only tells you of the questions that survived at this point in time, this [0] is the actual graph which while describes a curve that shows the same behavior, it's more \"accurate\" of the actual post creation.\n- This is actually a Good Thing™. For years most of the questions went unanswered, non-voted, non-commented, just because there was too many questions happening all the time. So the general trend is not something that the SO community needs to do anything about. Almost 20% of every question asked is marked as duplicate. If people searched... better™ they wouldn't ask as many questions, and so everyone else had more bandwidth to deal with the rest.\n- There has been a shift in help desk style of request, where people starting to prefer discord and such to get answers. This is actually a bad thing because that means that the knowledge isn't public nor indexed by the world. So, information becomes harder to find, and you need to break it free from silos.\n- The site, or more accurately, the library will never die. All the information is published in complete archives that anyone can replicate and restart if the company goes under or goes evil. So, yeah, such concerns, while appreciated, are easily addressed.

Google also continued to do a better and better job of surfacing the right StackOverflow thread, even if the SO search didn't.In 2012 you might search Google, not find what you needed, go to StackOverflow, search and have no better luck, then make a post (and get flamed for it being a frequently-asked question but you were phrasing yours in a different / incorrect way and didn't find the \"real\" answer).In 2017, you would search Google and the relevant StackOverflow thread would be in the top few results, so you wouldn't need to post and ask.In 2020, Google's \"rich snippets\" were showing you the quick answers in the screen real estate that is now used by the AI Overview answers, and those often times had surfaced some info taken from StackOverflow.And then, at the very end of 2022, ChatGPT came along and effectively acted as the StackOverflow search that you always wanted - you could phrase your question as poorly as you want, no one would flame you, and you'd get some semblance of the correct answer (at least for simple questions).I think StackOverflow was ultimately a victim of it's own success. Most of the questions that would be asked by your normal \"question asker\" type of user were eventually \"solved\" and it was just a matter of how easy it was to find them. Google, ChatGPT, \"AI Overviews\", Claude Code, etc have simply made finding those long-answered questions much easier, as well as answering all of the \"new\" questions that could be posed - and without all of the drama and hassle of dealing with a human-moderated site.",

LLMs just happen to be capable of reading A LOT of documentation a LOT faster, and then coming up with an answer A LOT faster.",

As a professional, I don’t care about Reddit Karma or the SO score or my HN karma. I just wanted answers that are correct, and a place to discuss anything that’s actually interesting.I did value SO once as part of the tedious process of attempting to get some technical problem solved, as it was the best option we had, but I definitely haven’t been there since 2023.

Based on time, author and title, I think either https://stacks.cdc.gov/view/cdc/78082/cdc_78082_DS1.pdf or https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10395540/ should be a fair summary of the meeting (I hope...).I don't really have time to read it all, but the basic idea is as you said - the cost-benefit ratio is off. Basically expanding from something like the current case, to vaccinating up to 45 year old will avert an extra 21k cases of cancer (compared to the base case of 1.4 million) - so about an extra 1.5% cases averted, while the direct vaccination costs are estimated to increase from 44 billion to 57 billion (+29%).The current guidance says \"do not recommend\" plus \"consult your doctor\". You should read that as \"blanket vaccination as public policy is cost inefficient in that age range\" not \"you as a 45 year old should not get the vaccine categorically\".",

I’m assuming that this is because it isn’t registered by the immune system as being harmful, for whatever reason.2) The attenuated virus in the vaccine would not produce an immune response without the adjuvant, because even viruses that are registered as harmful are not reliably registered as harmful when attenuated. This is where the adjuvant packaged with the attenuated virus comes in - it is registered by the body as harmful, and in its confusion the immune system also adds the virus to the registry.So, naively, if the immune system previously didn’t register the natural infection as harmful, and if it does register the virus in the vaccine as harmful, why doesn’t the registry entry for the vaccine also get applied to the natural infection, the same way as it does for a person who wasn’t previously infected?Is there some kind of specificity hierarchy, along with a “not harmful” registry alongside the “harmful” registry, such that the natural infection continues to get its previous classification of “not harmful” because the “not harmful” registry entry is more specific than the “harmful” registry entry? That’s the only explanation I can (naively) think of.And if that’s the case, could we first wipe out the registry by infecting the person with measles, and then give them the HPV vaccine?

          "content": "It was a misleading post.For the HPV section specifically, there were at least two major omissions.First, in his table showing autoimmune adverse effects, he has chosen to crop out the next column in the table containing the control conditions - which show very similar rates of adverse effects to the vaccine condition.Secondly, when discussing negative efficacy in the case of existing persistent infection, he only quotes the data from one of three studies that the linked report covers. The linked report indeed covers the negative efficacy in study 013 as an area of concern. However, study 015 (which had roughly twice the number of total participants as study 013) showed no real evidence of negative efficacy. When all 3 studies are pooled together, the point estimate still says negative efficacy, (at ~-12%), however the error bars are quite wide.Why this is tragic, is because these two omissions do actually point to failures in public communication about the vaccine. For example, the control condition in the Merck trials were a mix of saline injections (this is the traditional placebo), as well as injections with just the adjuvant (AAHS). This is less standard, and raises legitimate questions about why Merck used an adjuvant as the control, instead of just saline. There a cynical/conspiratorial angle to this question, which I think would be directionally correct.The second omission is because I think there is a reasonable question of \"are there extra risks associated with getting the HPV vaccine while having an active persistence infection\", even when taking into account the different and larger study populations within the original trial data. Once again, I think the idea that both companies and public health agencies don't want to deal with a vaccine that requires testing before hand is true. I also believe that on a population level, even if there was a modest increase in risk in that specific subgroup, it makes sense to implement broad vaccination campaigns.That said, I think the unwillingness of public health agencies to engage with this tricky area of communication and education creates these types of opening for anti-vaccine messaging. If you want a sense of \"conspiracy\" - here's a random review study - https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8706722/Notice that when reporting results, the groupings for HPV status at enrollment time are \"naive\" and \"irrespective\" - the \"test positive\" grouping isn't broken out.EDIT: The article that we're discussing is https://www.midwesterndoctor.com/p/the-perils-of-vaccinating...",

However, natural infection often does not provide immunity, so reinfection can easily occur (even from the same partner or a different part of your own body).People often assume that HPV is either a lifetime infection or that recovery guarantees immunity - neither is the case!",

The biggest problem with that logic is that not all strains are as dangerous and they probably have not contracted 16 or 18 specifically. The other problem is there's still a good number of people who have never had it and shouldn't assume they have because its common.As people cite these statistics, it would be useful to distinguish exposure to HPV causing foot warts, etc from the much more dangerous variants.

It is kind of a difference in philosophy here.One trade off is that I am not so likely to get involved in such a project. I may start a discussion, but in general I am very chaotic and may never follow up on discussions I started, simply due to lack of time, too many things to do, forgetting too much too (I do keep notes locally, but these files just keep on growing!).",

This sentence, when considered alone, might be seen to imply that all trade-offs are in a sense, ok, because they are all sort of a matter of taste. This doesn't mesh with my understanding of the world. I frame it this way: for a given objective, some trade-offs are better than others.Put in reverse, when I see a project making certain trade-offs, I don't assume those trade-offs are in service of some clearly defined objective. Often I see people and organizations mired in trade-offs that are inertial and/or unconsidered.There is another interesting angle to consider: framing as a question it would be: «When building a product or running a project, how do I make sense of a huge variety of trade-offs?» For that, exploring the Pareto frontier can be a useful method (see [1]) because it reduces the combinatorial explosion.In the case of Ghostty, I think its values are indeed better served by this GitHub process (which designates an issue as a clear actionable task derived from a discussion).[1]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pareto_front",

Just because someone creates an issue that doesn't necessarily mean the issue exists or isn't already tracked somewhere else, or that the ticket has all the necessary and sufficient information to troubleshoot an issue. When a ticket is created, the first step is to have someone look at it and check if there's something to it. This happens even when tickets are created by internal stakeholders, such as QAs.GitHub supports ticket labels, and the default set already cover these scenarios.https://docs.github.com/en/issues/using-labels-and-milestone...To me this discussion sounds like a project decided to update their workflow to move triage out of tickets and into a separate board.

The discussion is open and this is the system working as intended!I want to clarify though that there isn't a known widespread \"memory leak issue.\" You didn't say \"widespread\", but just in case that is taken by anyone else. :) To clarify, there are a few challenges here:1. The report at hand seems to affect a very limited number of users (given the lack of reports and information about them). There are lots of X meme posts about Ghostty in the macOS \"Force Close\" window using a massive amount of RAM but that isn't directly useful because that window also reports all the RAM _child processes_ are using (e.g. if you run a command in your shell that consumes 100 GB of RAM, macOS reports it as Ghostty using 100 GB of RAM). And the window by itself also doesn't tell us what you were doing in Ghostty. It farms good engagement, though.2. We've run Ghostty on Linux under Valgrind in a variety of configurations (the full GUI), we run all of Ghostty's unit tests under Valgrind in CI for every commit, and we've run Ghostty on macOS with the Xcode Instruments leak checker in a variety of configurations and we haven't yet been able to find any leaks. Both of these run fully clean. So, the \"easy\" tools can't find it.3. Following point 1 and 2, no maintainer familiar with the codebase has ever seen leaky behavior. Some of us run a build of Ghostty, working full time in a terminal, for weeks, and memory is stable.4. Our Discord has ~30K users, and within it, we only have one active user who periodically gets a large memory issue. They haven't been able to narrow this down to any specific reproduction and they aren't familiar enough with the codebase to debug it themselves, unfortunately. They're trying!To be clear, I 100% believe that there is some kind of leak affecting some specific configuration of users. That's why the discussion is open and we're soliciting input. I even spent about an hour today on the latest feedback (posted earlier today) trying to use that information to narrow it down. No dice, yet.If anyone has more info, we'd love to find this. :)",

I've been enjoying the teaching and research I'm doing, but I'm interested in getting back to making products people actually use. I have significant database and systems experience including as one of the PMC members of Apache Calcite, an open source relational data management platform used by Uber, Netflix, and others.I have 10+ years experience as a software engineer/researcher (including as a grad student) and my lab, the Data Unity Lab at the Rochester Institute of Technology works on some cool stuff related to non-relational data management. I still find the time to write code both with my students and my own. Delivering high-quality code along with any work I publish is very important to me.I'm interested in either senior software/data engineering or data science roles.

It was reasonably short, like the kind of problem an experienced developer could do in 10-15 minutes and then add some polish, documentation, and submit it in under an hour.Even though I told candidates that we’d discuss their submission as part of the next step, we would still get candidates submitting solutions that seemed entirely foreign to them a day later. This was on the cusp of LLMs being useful, so I think a lot of solutions were coming from people’s friends or copied from something on the internet without much thought.Now that LLMs are both useful and well known, the temptation to cheat with them is huge. For various reasons I think students and applicants see using LLMs as not-cheating in the same situations where they wouldn’t feel comfortable copying answers from a friend. The idea is that the LLM is an available tool and therefore they should be able to use it. The obvious problem with that argument is that we’re not testing students or applicants on their abilities to use an LLM, we’re using synthetic problems to explore their own skills and communication.Even some of the hiring managers I know who went all in on allowing LLMs during interviews are changing course now. The LLM-assisted interviewed were just turning into an exercise of how familiar the candidate was with the LLM being used.I don’t really agree with some of the techniques they’re using in this article, but the problem they’re facing is very real.",

To speed things up, he built a great computer and provided it with a programmatic duplicate of his own mind, that it might conduct the necessary research in his stead.But the machine, instead of setting to work, began to expand. It grew new stories, wings, and outbuildings, and when Trurl finally lost his patience and commanded it to stop building and start thinking, the machine—or rather, the Trurl-within-the-machine—replied that it couldn't possibly think yet, for it still didn't have enough room. It claimed it was currently housing the Sub-Trurls—specialized programs for General Felicitology, Experimental Hedonistics, and Happiness-Machine-Building—who were currently occupied with their quarterly reports.The 'Clone-Trurl' told him marvelous tales of the results these sub-Trurls had already achieved in their digital simulations. Trurl, however, soon discovered that these were all cut from the same cloth of lies; not a single sub-Trurl existed, no research had been done, and the machine had simply been using its processing power to enjoy itself and expand its own architecture.

Here's one university's explanation[1]:> Exempt human subjects research is a specific sub-set of “research involving human subjects” that does not require ongoing IRB oversight. Research can qualify for an exemption if it is no more than minimal risk and all of the research procedures fit within one or more of the exemption categories in the federal IRB regulations. *Studies that qualify for exemption must be submitted to the IRB for review before starting the research. Pursuant to NU policy, investigators do not make their own determination as to whether a research study qualifies for an exemption — the IRB issues exemption determinations.* There is not a separate IRB application form for studies that could qualify for exemption – the appropriate protocol template for human subjects research should be filled out and submitted to the IRB in the eIRB+ system.Most of my research is in CS Education, and I have often been able to get my studies under the Exempt status. This makes my life easier, but it's still a long arduous paperwork process. Often there are a few rounds to get the protocol right. I usually have to plan studies a whole semester in advance. The IRB does NOT like it when you decide, \"Hey I just realized I collected a bunch of data, I wonder what I can do with it?\" They want you to have a plan going in.[1] https://irb.northwestern.edu/submitting-to-the-irb/types-of-...",

Maybe.If there were specific functions you need to call, it would have a man page or similar on the test itself, or it would be the actual topic under test.I hand wrote a bunch of SQL queries. Hand wrote code for my Systems Programming class that involved pointers. I'm not even good with pointers. I hand wrote Java for job interviews.It's pretty rare that you need to actually test someone can memorize syntax, that's like the entire point of modern development environments.But if you are completely unable to function without one, you might not know as much as you would hope.The first algorithms came before the first programming languages.Sure, it means you need to be able to run the code in your head and be able to mentally \"debug\" it, but that's a featureIf you could not manage these things, you washed out in the CS101 class that nearly every STEM student took. The remaining students were not brilliant, but most of them could write code to solve problems. Then you got classes that could actually teach and test that problem solving itself.The one class where we built larger apps more akin to actual jobs, that could have been done entirely in the lab with locked down computers if need be, but the professor really didn't care if you wanted to fake the lab work, you still needed to pass the book learning for \"Programming Patterns\" which people really struggled with and you still needed to be able to give a \"Demo\" and presentation, and you still needed to demonstrate that you understood how to read some requests from a \"Customer\" and turn it into features and requirements and UXNobody cares about people sabotaging their own education except in programming because no matter how much MBAs insist that all workers are replaceable, they cannot figure out a way to actually evaluate the competency of a programmer without knowing programming. If an engineer doesn't actually understand how to evaluate static stresses on a structure, they are going to have a hard time keeping a job. Meanwhile in the world of programming, hopping around once a year is \"normal\" somehow, so you can make a lot of money while literally not knowing fizzbuzz.

There were always new excuses about what happened (shipping company stole our stuff! chip reseller scammed us! etc) but no transparency. The reality seems to be they ran out of money and instead of being upfront about it kept making up new stories why nothing was happening.\nThe few devices they have shipped are basically unusable unless you're going to mod the hard- and software yourself (no security updates, issues in antenna design, outdated hardware by the time it ships, keyboard quality issues, you name it).If you're interested in the device I implore you to wait until you can buy it upfront (ideally in a physical store) and return it at your convenience.I thought I needed a keyboard too, but when everything is designed for a slab screen and your \"productivity\" phone randomly shuts down or has no reception in a major area, you gotta think about what productivity really means.",

Now here comes a product that both provides a small form factor, and even better, is aimed at reducing distractions and provides features to that effect.It's running regular Android with a custom version of Niagara launcher (which it seems I need to try), and seems like it's a product built by people who want to use it. Which makes me hopeful that a lot of care was put into designing it. It seems like they're aiming it towards people that want a second device for work, which -in my mind- means there might be some compromises, so I'll be waiting for reviews to decide if it can hold up as a daily driver or not.It should be noted, they claim that the keyboard is touch sensitive and can be used for scrolling, so it might actually solve some of the usability issues that immediately come to mind.TBH, I'm a little surprised by all the hate. This might not be a product for you, or it might not speak to you for other reasons. The fact is that this company has seen success with their phone cases (I don't get it either), and has now announced two new products that should reach more of the market (the other is a magsafe slide out keyboard, it's very cool). If you don't like it, fair enough, but that doesn't mean it's a bad product.",

Coming up with an idea and getting some renders done is at least 1,000x easier than the remaining work from idea to shipping 10,000 units, therefore it's reasonable to expect that at least 90% of kickstarters for such products will fail to deliver, leaving backers holding the bag, since all our money has been spent already on the failed attempts.Furthermore, I tend to think that if, due to some combination of their existing reputation + the amount of the work they've already completely finished, the project were a safe bet, then they'd be able to get investors to front them any further needed startup funds the normal way.",

For navigating between characters, there's an excellent open source keyboard (https://github.com/palsoftware/pastiera) that provides a lot of features normally present in a soft keyboard that Unihertz didn't include in their keyboard. I switch between that and Swiftkey, though Swiftkey likes to open a full soft keyboard interface for no reason no matter how many ways I try to disable it.The aspect ratio/screen size issue is annoying, but I find that a combination of the screen lock setting (for annoying apps that rotate the screen when they go \"full screen\") combined with scrolling using the capacitive keyboard works just fine without blocking the entire screen.The one problem I have with the phone, and the reason I'm not dailying it, is that Unihertz is notoriously bad at providing software updates. I'm not too impressed with the Clicks phone either on that front, though at least they're beating Unihertz:> Communicator will run Android 16.

Keyboard still works flawlessly, but the case looks like it's seen an apocalypse...Also would love to see a video showcase of the touch functionality on the keyboard, I can already imagine a few ways that'll be useful.Am personally waiting for the next Razr before deciding whether I'll replace my iPhone with a Communicator or the next Clicks for Razr (hoping that there will be one). Then again, Motorola has hinted at a book style foldable for CES so if that is interesting, might go for the PowerKeys instead. Or might there be something for larger phones, perhaps inspired by an old Samsung phone, dare we dream? That'd \"zeal\" my purchase for sure...The keyboard is a really good lock in mind you, once I got the hang of it I really detested (a very strong word, but it is true) any time I had to use a smartphone without one, even if only briefly.",

Second, the pre-order reservation is about half of the full pre-order price.

I don’t think this one is that big of a secret, but it’s worth going through all the symbols to see everything that’s available.I don’t have an iPad currently, but I think it has the numbers on the top row of letters, and you can swipe up (or down, I don’t remember) on the key for quick entry of some numbers without changing to the symbol keyboard.Double tap the shift key for CAPS LOCK.In the Settings, there is built in text expansion support (Settings > General > Keyboard > Text Replacement).

RSS feeds - People using RSS aggregator services as well as local RSS reader tools.2. Newsletters - I was surprised to discover just how many tech newsletters there are on the Web and how active their user bases are. Once in a while, a newsletter picks up one of my silly or quirky posts, which then brings a large number of visits from its followers.3. Search engines - Traffic from Google, DuckDuckGo, Bing and similar search engines.

RSS订阅源——包括使用在线RSS聚合服务及本地阅读器的用户\n2. 邮件通讯——令我惊讶的是，网络上技术类邮件通讯的数量及其用户活跃度都远超预期。偶尔有通讯平台收录我的趣味文章时，便会从其订阅者群体带来大量访问\n3. 搜索引擎——来自谷歌、DuckDuckGo、必应等搜索引擎的流量。这类访问通常针对我站点的特定工具、游戏或教程文章，部分访客会反复回访相关内容\n\n[1] https://susam.net/from-web-feed-to-186850-hits.html"

There was a time in the past when you could subscribe your Facebook account to external RSS feeds. The entries in those feeds would create new content on your \"Facebook wall\". This essentially let you use any third party that supported RSS to publish content into your Facebook feed.Facebook removed that feature. The effect of this was that people had to create content within facebook instead of outside it. This reoriented the flow of content creation so that it must originate inside of Facebook, removing the ability to use FB as a passive consumer of content created in a workflow where the creators chose the entire flow.IMHO this is one of the biggest steps down ever in FB history. It was one of the biggest attacks on the open web, and I'm sad to say that it mostly worked, and the internet at large is worse as a result.",

We had a news letter that would summarize each of these. Many organizations like ours would post summaries of many things to a single blog post, basically the same as the newsletter. However, this was cumbersome. For example, if someone in the community had a question, it was much clearer to link to a single post on our site that answered the question AND ONLY answered that question.

In our view there are a set of equally important primitives: tasks, events, streaming/pubsub, concurrency, priority, rate limiting, scheduling, and yes, durable workflows.Tasks being the entrypoint to the platform, rather than immediately dealing with the overhead of durable workflows, generally makes Hatchet easier to adopt for engineering teams. I wrote a little more about how task queues relate to durable execution here: https://hatchet.run/blog/durable-executionWe've also invested quite heavily in platform features like logging, observability, alerting, and our UI which either aren't offered or are underdeveloped in Temporal.But ultimately I'd encourage people to give both a try - we're both MIT licensed and can easily be run locally.",

Documentation was still pretty bad last I checked, and that's the bare minimum before I can seriously adopt a new language.C3 feels like home for C developers, there is a real market for language evolutions rather than revolutions (imagine Typescript). The issue is that pretty much nobody knows about C3, most posts about it never get any traction on HN, and it's hard to choose a language with no mind share for anything more serious than toys.Odin is quite nice, has some hype behind it, deservedly. Feels like a nice improvement over C without completely throwing the baby away with the bathwater; perhaps one negative thing might be that it's so opinionated it feels less of a general purpose language than others (with the main dev focused on graphics, there's a lot of syntax sugar for that use case which feels out of place for anyone that is not writing desktop UI or games). Also, while I agree with the author's choice on not rewriting the compiler itself in Odin, as most other languages do, it doesn't strike much confidence that the author would rather develop in C++ than eat his own dog food.I must admit I don't keep up with alternative languages much any more because I believe the Lindy effect to be a force multiplier, and for serious applications it's better to stick with something that is known to work, despite its shortcomings. You only have a few points you can spend on innovation, and if you're developing a complex application, at the very least you want a rock-solid base to build upon.

Ignore the invariants. You wrote them down, a human can read them, but the machine doesn't care. You might just as well use comments or annotate the documentation, and indeed some people do.2. Check the invariants. If the invariant wasn't true then something went wrong and we might tell somebody about that.3. Assume these invariants are always true. Therefore the optimiser may use them to emit machine code which is smaller or faster but only works if these invariants were correct.So for example maybe a language lets you say only that the whole program is checked, or, that the whole program can be assumed true, or, maybe the language lets you pick, function A's contract about pointer validity we're going to check at runtime, but function B's contract that you must pick an odd number, we will use assumption, we did tell you about that odd number requirement, have the optimiser emit that slightly faster machine code which doesn't work for N=0 -- because zero isn't an odd number assumption means it's now fine to use that code.",

The proliferation of LLVM has created the perception that writing machine code is an extremely difficult endeavor that should not be pursued by mere mortals. In truth, you can get going writing x86_64 assembly in a day. With a few weeks of effort, it is possible to emit all of the basic x86_64 instructions. I have heard aarch64 is even easier but I only have experience with x86_64.What you then realize is that it is possible to generate quality machine code much faster than LLVM and using far fewer resources. I believe both that LLVM has been holding back compiler evolution and that it is close to if not already at peak popularity. As LLMs improve, the need for tighter feedback loops will necessitate moving off the bloat of LLVM. Moreover, for all of the magic of LLVMs optimization passes, it does very little to prevent the user from writing incorrect code. I believe we will demand more from a compiler backend than LLVM can ever deliver.The main selling point of LLVM is that you gain access to all of the targets, but this is for me a weak point in its favor. Firstly, one can write a quality self hosting compiler with O(20) instructions. Adding new backends should be trivial. Moreover, the more you are thinking about cross platform portability, the more you are worrying about hypothetical problems as well as the problems of people other than yourself.

In particular, you DONT need to learn double entry to do plain text accounting. Of course, you SHOULD learn double entry accounting because it's a great tool for organizing knowledge.Whether plain text is beneficial for accounting is less clear cut in my mind. I think plain text is backlash against the over-reliance on \"services\", \"clouds\", and \"lock in\", but I think it's misguided. If you're concerned with someone locking you in, it's perfectly concievable to do double entry accounting which lives only on your computer and manipulated with software that is under your control (read: free software).So in summary, my opinon is:- accounting: important- double entry: important- avoid clouds and ventor lock in: important- avoid proprietary file formats: important- plain text: unimportant(I use GnuCash. It's not without its flaws, but it's great if you agree with the above views)",

I can still handle that in Beancount, but it's unaware of $CURRENT_DATE, making it labour intensive: if you post an expense for the next week, it will already deduct it from your balance, you'd have to post the item as a liability, and then later move the liability to an expense once it actually hit the bank account (and you have to do that manually);2) I matured my personal finances by following the YNAB method, and I'm not sure how to apply that to DEBK;3) I think most people use a Personal Finances software differently than me.

I think the barrier to entry is high because you first need to learn double entry bookkeeping  (if you haven't already) and then you need to decide between ledger-cli, hledger, or beancount, with the differentiators being on the margins and with some promise of being able to switch later. The choice really comes down to which tool has the documentation/community that makes the most sense to you at the time.Then, there's the import workflow: which \"accounts\" should you start with? How much history do you pull in? How do you set up an automatic importer? Hledger has a DSL. Beancount uses Python. Either way, an OP says, much of your time is spent manually editing text.And finally, then what? Can I make a budget now? Will this thing do my taxes? Am I more financially responsible? How do I explain this to my spouse? My pension is kind of like a commodity, but I don't know what the unit price is, and I don't sell units, but what's a virtual PnL and what if I only have a quarterly PDF!?It may sound like I'm ranting, but I have found that realizing I don't know the answers to these questions (or even that they exist) is the true benefit of PTA.Every year, I'm asked if I want a different pension investment mix or if I want to change my car insurance. Or, I might wonder if I'm getting a good deal on my internet plan or if a new job offer's total comp is actually better. Am I \"on track\" for \"retirement,\" how long until I have enough for a new roof, am I keeping up with inflation, did I spend too much on gifts this year?There's immense privilege in not really needing to know the answers to these questions; getting them \"wrong\" won't really hurt you. But, being familiar with the routine minutiae of your economy by way of counting every cent, is rewarding, enlightening, and empowering—even if it's also finicky and brittle sometimes.I may have to try beancount again.

Maybe that's enough for most people, but for me I want everything, investments, liabilities, assets etc. None of these commercial offerings have that because it's so complex and niche, e.g. your open banking provider won't tell you how your pension is doing.It's also just nice to have the provenance of transactions, e.g. if you receive some shares from work, and you sell the shares and the money ends up in your bank account - the incoming transaction will just be the net proceeds but it won't tell you if you paid any tax prior to that - PTA gives you a more of a complete picture that tracks the whole chain of events that led up that transaction into your bank happening.

It gives you a better picture of where your money goes, what your bur rate is, how much of your spend is on mandatory stuff (food, rent/mortage etc.) and how much is on things you could potentially cut if need be. It makes it possible to know how far you are from various levels (/lifestyles) of financial independence. I have a pretty good idea that I could make it to retirement even if I permanently lost my job and I know what that lifestyle would roughly be like.This also makes it possible to do proper budgeting by setting aside realistic amounts even for irregular expenses, so you're essentially 'saving up' for the irregular expenses. Done right, your \"expenses\" (money set aside in budget) are exactly the same month after month even though your actual money outflows in some months may be much higher. This is both true for the irregular expenses like travel, but also for semi-regular expenses that may come due only annually or every three months (mortgage etc.).For me personally, it made me feel much more comfortable about spending larger amounts on travel etc. because I've already saved up the money via budgeting and I've never seen it as savings that goes away. Savings are per definition the difference in monthly income vs month set aside in budget. I make sure to be a bit conservative, so I actually also build a buffer on the savings account, usable for truly extraordinary expenses.But your current situation sounds healthy - and if you have amble cushion, and you're confident it will continue that way and you have no desire to change it yourself, the above is of course less relevant.",

You can have automation with or without plain text.Second, your emphasis on \"automation\" leads me to believe that perhaps you misunderstand what accounting is. Accounting is not just taking a list of transactions and recording them (database, file etc). That is called bookkeeping. Yes, accounting is also amenable to automation, but much less so than bookkeeping. Although, you could argue that when applied to the life of a normal individual, accounting and bookkeeping are almost indistinguishable. You have income, you have costs, and you have a mortgage - pretty straightforward. My point is in general you cannot entirely automate accounting. The reason for that is that accounting isn't just processing bytes, but instead requires the understanding of the underlying economics associated with the transactions. This understanding in turn isn't stored anywhere other than the accountant's mental model of the entity he's doing the accounting for.EDIT: Just to be clear, I don't disagree with you that accounting could use more automation. Everything could use more automation. But for something it's more straightforward than others.",

I'm from Denmark and there we say \"aktiver\" (actives) must equal \"passiver\" (passives/liabilities) - which seemed very unintuitive. Why would they be equal - and exactly equal (down to the last cent)?\nI mean, what if I buy a piece of candy and then eat it? Even if we accept that buying it turns it into an asset, wouldn't eating it cause a reduction in assets and thereby make the two sides diverge? Surely when eaten, something is lost, so again how can they be equal?\nI saw the 'light' when I started tracking my own finances in a spreadsheet. I started tracking the value of all accounts in a separate sheet, summing them to see how much money I had. Then, I started tracking all expenses to see in detail how much I spent each month.\nEventually, it dawned on me to connect these subsheets to check that I hadn't forgotten an expense or typed a wrong number. It worked like this: every month I summed up the accounts and made a note. At the end of the next month, I would update the account values with new balances from the bank, and then verify that the change in balance matched exactly the sum of the spending (plus income).\nThen I realized: hey, maybe this is what double entry accounting is all about. It is mostly a terminology question; the \"assets equal liabilities\" phrasing is what trips people up, and the candy mystery is of course explained by just having various entries accounting for this.\nWhile I do know graph theory, I don't see the relation to double entry accounting. I can't imagine how introducing graph theory simplifies it, though maybe I don't truly understand it after all ;)",

My main gripe with GnuCash is that it's impossible to do \"mass actions\" from the UI.On the point of \"library\" - you know that \"GnuCash the app\" comes with its lib, and there's python wrappers? I've only ever used these to produce reports (read, reports different from the ones provided by the UI). However I believe it's also possible to do things like inserting transactions via these python wrappers.Another example of something which is possible via the python wrappers is labels. GnuCash doesn't support labels, but it supports adding general text to each transaction and to each leg of each transaction. So you can e.g. use hashtags in the text, and then consume transactions into python and aggregate on these hashtags, making them effectively labels.",

Swift's codec system revolves around it (it only handles types that are compatible with JSON).It sucks, but we're stuck with JSON. So the idea here is to make it suck a little less by stopping all this insane text processing for data that never ever meets a human directly.The progression I envisage is:1. Dev reaches for JSON because it's easy and ubiquitous.2. Dev switches to BONJSON because it's more efficient and requires no changes to their code other than changing the codec library.3. Dev switches to a sane format after the complexity of their app reaches a certain level where a substantial code change is warranted.",

I really _don't_ need to be even opening internet browsers for anything. T9 phone with a week of battery life, the ability to play some mp3's and GPS navigation and.. sigh I guess some way for me to issue MFA for okta/entraid/whatever since that's so ubiquitous with workplace security now... and I'd be set.it's wild how advanced the likes of hardware companies were over a decade ago at making miniature hardware. the last generation ipod nano (7th I think?) was this tiny touch screen device and when I hold it in my hand today it feels ... actually magic. seriously it feels mind blowing, state of the art with how small and responsive it is. like that kind of miniaturization doesn't seem to exist anymore & it's something only the hardware giants at scale seemed to be able to do since they had supply chain connections and R&D warchests to blow on designing custom components. A lot of these dumb phones rely on generalist components I think and they aren't bankrolled with bajillions of dollars to get new R&D going and tooling online to really put an impressive device together, I just never see it in these \"disconnect but stay just connected enough\" dumb-phones that are trying to offer an exit from the noise of modern smart phones.i'd absolutely cherish something that had the form of the nokia xpress music 5310 https://news.softpedia.com/images/extra/MOBILE/large/Nokia_5... with gps navigation, the ability to play music, and workplace MFA capability.that's it, i've thought about it and i seriously don't need anything else. yeah whatsapp and spotify are super ubiquitous these days but they're literally not required to get in touch with me. and for spotify, i finally did do that whole \"nerd mods an ipod 15 years later thing\" and it taught me something that i needed to know about myself: ADHD + spotify = bad. my last decades playlists are a mess, i listen to music _less_ because it's just an onslaught of new stuff and access to everything. something about having a collection of music i actually took time to curate into playlists..i know what's in there i know what i can listen to. it's somewhere between meditative (which is good for me) and very intentional. acquiring new music is now also very intentional, getting it onto my device is intentional. its slower, less convenient, and somehow it makes me enjoy the music experience a lot more. im listening to more music now in a way that I haven't since I was sitting on a schoolbus next to my crush and sharing a headphone with her.all in all I've seen a few of these \"dumb phones, no distraction\" device manufs now like punkt here start off with a cool design and eventually just cave and fold to some full screen touch design. to me that just nixes a lot of checkboxes for me: more screen = undoubtedly more distractions and ways to be connected, i miss buttons, i just... don't want a big phone. ever. i want to be intentional about my connectivity, and that means if i need the internet i need to just go hop on my computer. if im itching to know something and im standing in an elevator or standing on a subway, i actually don't want to be able to pull my phone out and have the immediacy of an answer. i want to stay bored in my head, work on the skill of \"this is important i hope i come back to it lets index that thought and come back to it later\", and just learn to live with being in my own head without the constant need to have an answer or scratch a dopamine itch immediately. there's something ive completely lost over the years, basically that ability to imagine spiderman swinging from the powerlines when i was a kid looking out the window of my parents car. whatever _that_ is, i think that came with a lot of core benefits for my brain activity that generally allowed me to have a more meaningful and happier life.",

It was disheartening seeing him ruin his life over this \"hope\".I certainly don't doubt that my uncle also felt a strong sense of \"hope\" when he bought his lottery tickets, but for what differed a lot. My uncle would buy lottery tickets in the hope of regaining the amount of money that he had lost to gambling, while you probably buy them in the hope of having a significantly higher quality of life if you win. One is financially a very bad decision, the other is not (as bad).Personally, I would never buy lottery tickets. Not because the chance of you winning is small, but because you're supporting a predatory system that attacks those that are the most vulnerable to gambling: those who've already lost large amounts of money. I hate the gambling industry and the damage it causes to regular people.Luckily my uncle has stopped gambling, but the effects of when he was a gambler are still, sadly, visible.",

      "abstract": "该讨论围绕塔斯马尼亚造船厂推出的“世界最大电动船”展开。核心话题聚焦于该船的技术特点、实用性与环保意义，同时社区对“最大电动船”的表述存在争议。\n\n有用户指出该船采用铝制船体减轻重量，并针对浅水航行优化设计，体现了技术亮点；也有用户质疑其“最大”称号，认为需与核动力航母等对比才具意义。讨论中提到该船搭载250吨电池，续航约90分钟，引发对电池方案合理性的探讨——部分用户认为相比传统发电机组合，纯电池方案在短途固定航线中可能更具能效优势，但其他用户则对电池重量与等效燃油驱动系统的对比数据缺失表示关切。\n\n此外，有用户从美学角度批评其外观，另有建议增加太阳能模块以补充能源。尽管存在分歧，社区普遍认可电动船在减少排放方面的积极意义，并对其在特定航线的应用前景持开放态度。",

The resulting weight savings make it a bit more efficient. That's something this shipping yard specializes in.- Because it is going to run in shallow water on the river Plate, it doesn't actually have propellers but a water jet propulsion system.Fully charged did a video on the construction of this ship early last year: https://fullycharged.show/episodes/electric-ferry-the-larges...The project of getting this ship from Tasmania to South America is also going to be interesting as well. It can't do it under its own power; it's designed for a ~50km crossing, not a trans Pacific/Atlantic journey. At the time, they were thinking tug boats.",

          "content_cn": "《卫报》的文章略过了这艘船几个真正有趣的特点：它采用铝材而非钢材建造，由此减轻的重量使其效率更高，这正是这家造船厂的专长所在。由于它将在拉普拉塔河的浅水区航行，实际上并未配备螺旋桨，而是采用了喷水推进系统。去年初，Fully Charged节目曾制作一期关于这艘船建造过程的视频：https://fullycharged.show/episodes/electric-ferry-the-larges... 将这艘船从塔斯马尼亚运往南美的计划也值得关注——它无法依靠自身动力完成这段航程，因其设计仅适用于约50公里的跨海行程，而非横跨太平洋或大西洋的远航。据悉，运输方案考虑采用拖船牵引。"

That's 600-1200kwDC, given its flat, at 800kwp/kWh, that means for an hour of peak production, after losses, would do at least 300kwh for the smaller size and 600kwh for the larger size. If each trip is around 1150kwh and takes longer than an hour, more than half of the power required could be generated. As solar modules are solid-state devices, seems short sighted to not slam a system on the roof. PV modules are literally just glass sandwiches with wires and DC to DC battery chargers are very efficient.

Or maybe it's a terminology thing?The thing is—and this is coming from someone who has been making electronic dance music daily for over 35 years and counting—when Bangalter spoke earlier in their career about a PC (likely an Atari ST or Falcon) it was being used as a MIDI / SMPTE timepiece and master sequencer, nothing more. Later when he speaks about never making music with a computer, the context of the discussion has changed, as by that time computers were becoming more accomplished at DSP. The comment he is making is that they didn't use computers for audio domain tasks, like Pro Tools, Digital Audio Workstation type action.That said, computers were still deeply embedded in their workflow just not in the way most modern producers would recognize. Even the SSL 9000 J console at the heart of their studio relied on an onboard computer system for total recall, automation, and channel configuration. The distinction Bangalter draws is really about where the actual audio lived: in 12-bit sampler memory, on tape and through analog audio circuits, not as samples and waveforms being crunched inside a CPU.

I still consider the written word to be vastly superior to video form.But the videos earn an income (about 1/2 what I earned as a software dev, but it's sustainable and lets me do whatever projects I like), whereas the blog has earned maybe a few thousand dollars with Amazon Affiliate links each year (it covers the hosting, at least, and gives a little extra cash, but I try to keep the blog as \"old school web\" as possible.Just finished upgrading it to Hugo today!

      "abstract": "本次讨论围绕第39届混沌通信大会（39C3）的视频内容展开。用户们分享了各自推荐的演讲，并表达了对大会内容的不同看法。  \n\n有人认为技术类演讲质量很高，例如GPG破解、从零开始的电子制造、蓝牙耳机安全漏洞等议题受到好评。也有用户指出大会呈现“高质量技术演讲与左翼极端主义内容并存”的混合特点，对此表达了复杂感受。讨论中提到，科利·多克托罗关于“通用计算战争”的演讲以及Signal总裁关于AI风险的发言引发了较多关注。  \n\n在整体评价上存在分歧：部分用户认为大会内容依然精彩，列举了多个值得观看的技术演讲；但也有用户批评大会“逐年变差”，认为有趣的技术议题越来越少，出现了“今不如昔”的感慨。此外，有用户提及原定的AI主题演讲因演讲者邮件争议被取消，成为讨论中的一个小插曲。  \n\n总体而言，社区普遍认同本届大会仍包含一系列具有启发性的技术分享，但在内容平衡与发展趋势上存在不同判断。",

But of course, that only raises a further question: Why would every other country in the world agree to let America steal its own people's money and data, and block its domestic tech sector from making interoperable products that would prevent this theft?> Here's an anecdote that unravels this riddle: many years ago, in the years before Viktor Orban rose to power, I used to guest-lecture at a summer PhD program in political science at Budapest's Central European University. And one summer, after I'd lectured to my students about anticircumvention law, one of them approached me.> They had been the information minister of a Central American nation during the CAFTA negotiations, and one day, they'd received a phone-call from their trade negotiator, calling from the CAFTA bargaining table. The negotiator said, \"You know how you told me not to give the Americans anticircumvention under any circumstances? Well, they're saying that they won't take our coffee unless we give them anticircumvention. And I'm sorry, but we just can't lose the US coffee market. Our economy would collapse. So we're going to give them anticircumvention. I'm really sorry.\"> That's it. That's why every government in the world allowed US Big Tech companies to declare open season on their people's private data and ready cash.> The alternative was tariffs. Well, I don't know if you've heard, but we've got tariffs now!> I mean, if someone threatens to burn your house down unless you follow their orders, and then they burn your house down anyway, you don't have to keep following their orders. So…Happy Liberation Day?",

      "abstract": "该讨论围绕Linux内核安全工作的理念与实践展开。核心争议在于内核维护者“安全漏洞只是普通漏洞”的立场是否合理。有用户指出，这种观点不成熟且有害，认为明确标注安全漏洞有助于优先修复，但当前政策可能让关键漏洞被忽视。另一方面，有人认为不公开标注漏洞可避免为攻击者提供明确目标，且所有漏洞都应平等修复。讨论中提到，尽管Linux拥有众多开发者审查，但过去许多问题本可更早避免。也有用户肯定Red Hat等公司在持续安全维护上的价值。此外，部分评论涉及技术实践，如虚拟化安全改进、Docker镜像与内核的关系等。整体上，社区对内核安全工作的复杂性有共识，但在漏洞分类与披露策略上存在明显分歧。",

Therefore, not only do you not want new features, but you also don't want irrelevant bug fixes. Bug fixes, even security fixes, are not magically free of independent regressions. Therefore a valid incentive exists to minimize backports to production environments. And such a balancing act depends on the careful investigation of the impact of known bugs, one by one.From the fine blog post:> For those that are always worried “what if a bugfix causes problems”, they should remember that a fix for a known bug is better than the potential of a fix causing a future problem as future problems, when found, will be fixed then.A whole lot of users can disagree with this.

I’ve heard proposals for exponentially growing fees to allow truly big enterprises to stay copywritten longer, like 14+14 with filing and $100, another 14 for $100,000, another 14 for $10M, another 14 for $100M. That would allow 70 years or protection for a few key pieces of IP that are worth it, which seems like an okay trade off?I've always been a fan of this, but here's a great detraction:> I think would diminish independent author rights. Quite often, a novel will become popular only decades after publishing, and I think the author should be able to profit on the fruits of their labour without wealthy corporations tarnishing their original IP, or creating TV shows and the link with no reperations to the creator. Fantasy book are a good example. A Games of Thrones was first released in 1996 but had middling success. It was only after 2011 that the series exploded in popularity. Good Omens main peak was ~15 years after release. Hell, some books like Handmaiden's Tale were published in 1985 but only reached their peak in 2010. IP law was originally to protect artist and authors from the wealthy, but now it seems to have the opposite intent.This is a very solid point. Works sometimes only become popular decades after their initial release.Perhaps a way to protect individual artists would be to limit the number of copyrights held by a particular entity. The more you aggregate or hold on to, the steeper the cost to maintain the copyright. I'm sure loopholes like \"we're a holding company of holding companies\" might be invented to counter this, but if we tied this to real people rather than corporations it might work.Copyrights shouldn't last longer than humans.",

I think  that GRR Martin's books would be giving him sizeable profit, even if someone else were able to make GoT fanfiction in the same universe, and the GoT TV Series would still have to pay him to use the more recent copyrighted books, not just the settings and characters from the original.There is already intrinsic value in having written the original work, and that intrinsic value will make you the best person to consult on a TV adaption or make sequels, even if the original work is public domain and in theory anyone could adapt it.If an author makes something 20 years ago, doesn't build on the universe any more beyond that, and is unable to compete in their own universe they built against other authors once it goes public domain and becomes popular, well, then tough luck for the author.Let's look at how this works for software: every piece of open-source software out there is something that in theory another company could take and sell as their own. Red Hat Linux is Open Source, so sure anyone can make their own... and yet Red Hat can sell consulting services and new versions of it because they're the only group with proper expertise there.> limit the number of copyrights held by a particular entityEntities are unfortunately quite easy to fake and difficult to define in a fool-proof way.If you can still license copyrights, then holding companies would become the norm. Like, right now LucasArts owns StarWars, and LucasArts is a wholly-owned subsidiary of Disney, but if we had a limit on how many copyrights an entity can hold, Disney wouldn't acquire LucasArts, and would instead pay for an exclusive copyright license.",

There’s still a global cap of 100 concurrent sessions + per-user limits to keep things stable during spikes.I’ve also added an “Attributions & Acknowledgements” section.The backstory is wild: UNIX v4 being recovered from a ~1973 tape at the University of Utah after being effectively “lost” for decades.

The code performing this function does not check the source and destination addresses properly, permitting portions of the monitor to be overlaid by the user. This can be used to inject code into the monitor that will permit the user to seize control of the machine.(Volume 1 is at https://apps.dtic.mil/sti/citations/AD0758206 .) However general awareness of the security implications seems to have been very limited before the Morris worm, and then even for several years after that. Even in late 1996 an article which in its own words \"attempt[ed] to explain what buffer overflows are, and how their exploits work\" could still be published in Phrack magazine, and in fact even be quite a milestone https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buffer_overflow#History .

For example, mkdir had a TOCTTOU which persisted into v7 (and I believe 2BSD); it was implemented as a setuid binary which did a mknod followed by a chown to create the directory. Code which invoked mkdir could set up a race replacing the root-owned directory, before the chown, with a link to something else -- which would then get chowned to the user running mkdir. The target had to be on the same filesystem as some writable directory, but on many installations of the day, a mkdir in /tmp followed by this race was good enough to get you ownership of /etc/passwd.This was finally cleaned up in 4.2bsd, when mkdir was made a single syscall which was guaranteed to alter only the particular inode it allocated.",

They were only available to be used by PhD candidates and other higher order beings. Those dudes had the root password anyway, so no need to harden the machine against their potential attacks. There was no networking to speak of, so no malicious traffic to worry about. The first worm didn't appear until the late 1980s.So if you had talked to a Unix sysadmin in 1973 (all...1 of them) they probably would understand the general concept of someone running a program that crapped onto kernel memory with the result they could have root privileges, but there would have been no plausible adversary around with any reason to mount that attack.

          "content": "I found this document[0] very insightful. It's quite a long read, but gradually introduces the concepts needed for double-entry bookkeeping.I think the main advantage is that you can granularly keep track of the movement of money, stocks, commodities, etc., and their conversions. As a day-to-day example, it gives you the ability to follow, for example, invoices received (Liabilities or Accounts Payable), transactions on a bank account (Assets), and what you are going to spend (or at some point, have spent) (Expenses).This separation allows you to, for example, enter an invoice you've received on January 1 in Accounts Payable, with a corresponding value in Expenses. At this moment, nothing happened yet, it's simply an administrative transfer of some amount from an asset account to an expenses account (the sum of these transfers must be zero, so one amount is negative whereas the other amount is positive. See [0] for more details).As a result, this gives you insight in what still needs to be paid. Once a transaction for that invoice enters your bank account on, for example, January 10, it gets \"paid\" to Accounts Payable, thus giving you a link between an invoice, its payment, and finally the amount spent. (This concept also works the other way around, see this sibling comment[1], where it's also extended into working with multiple accounts.)[0] https://beancount.github.io/docs/the_double_entry_counting_m...[1] https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46464893",

If you keep all of your money in one bank account and neither owe anyone or have anyone that owes you, then double-entry accounting is not necessary because you can record just the one side of every transaction – your bank account is the other side.However, if you have more than one account or debts, or budgets, then it becomes useful to track both sides of a transaction. If you track both sides of a transaction then you can easily answer questions like:\n1. how much money do I have in my investment account?\n2. how much debt do I have?\n3. how much did I spend on recreational social activities?You can track debts and investments separately, but then you are still making two entries just in two places.I think many people have few enough debts and investment account that they track these separately, and the third question, budgeting, can be simplified if each vendor is only ever considered for a single budget, for example, all your flights are part of your vacation budget, and you don't care to break out a flight to a career related conference.",

          "content": "Here is my explanation for \"software people who understand databases\". The structure of the explanation will be as follows:  1. Explain how you would do simple accounting with a database\n  2. Point out which indices you'd create for performance\n  3. Show how the \"double entry\" part of double entry accounting is about the indices\n\n1. The way you'd do accounting in a database is with two tables: One table for accounts (e.g. your checking account, or the supermarket account, which you don't own) and another table for transactions. The transactions move an amount of money from one account to another, e.g. from your checking account to the supermarket account. Or if you use it for budgeting, you might split your checking account into a groceries account, a rent account etc. (think \"categories\").2. For performance, you would create indices based on the accounts in the transaction table, so you could easily check what's going on e.g. in your groceries account or how much you spent at the supermarket.3. Double entry accounting was formalized in the 15th century, way before computers became a thing, but bound paper books were already somewhat affordable. The way you'd do accounting is like this: During the business day, you would write down your transactions as they happen, into a scrapbook, similar to the transactions table mentioned above. At the end of the day, you'd do the \"double entry\" part, which means you take your \"index\" books where each book is about one account and you transcribe each transaction from your scrap book into the two books of the two accounts that are mentioned in the transaction, e.g. if you spent $10 from your groceries account into the supermarket account, you'd double enter that transaction both into your \"groceries\" book and into your \"supermarket\" book. Then, when you want to check on how much you spent at the supermarket in a particular month, you could easily look it up in the supermarket book (this would be very tedious when using the scrap book). These account centered books are like the indices in the database mentioned above.So the double entry part is about clever index building for making it easier and faster to understand what's going on in your accounting system.",

I actually appreciate it when, e.g., a book is 1/2 the size and weight, and usually also made far more durably; but it will invariably compromise any author intention related to the arrangement of the lettering.Maybe you can confirm that based on what seems to be your English and German editions of the same novel.",

Sometimes the connection is a little fuzzy, but we do the best we can given that art must be pre-1930 and also must have been previously published.(My personal favorite artwork selection of the books I worked on is The Communist Manifesto[1]. That painting was actually made specifically for a different book by Willa Cather[2], but I thought the peasant laborer, holding a sickle in one hand, with a faraway look in her eyes as the red sun rises behind her was just too good to pass up for  Marx!)1920ish was when it started becoming much more common for books to have illustrated dust jackets, so now that more books from that era and onwards are entering the public domain, we opt to use the first edition dust jacket if it's in the appropriate style. Fortunately for us, that era also happens to be the so-called Golden Age of Illustration so it's not hard finding beautiful art to use![1] https://standardebooks.org/ebooks/karl-marx_friedrich-engels...[2] https://standardebooks.org/ebooks/willa-cather/the-song-of-t...",

For example, it:1. renders the cover as a JPG from the native SVG2. converts more complicated selectors (e.g. :nth-of-type, :empty, etc.) to classes and class selectors3. renders MathML as images4. renders SVGs as images…and a bunch more things to make it work better with older ereaders, which tend hang around for a long time.It’s worth pointing out that the Kobo builds are closer to the “advanced” build as they have great native support for MathML and SVG. But the build step adds in a bunch of Kobo-specific markup to make it work better there.In my experience, Apple Books does the best with the advanced builds, but it doesn’t support SVG covers so you end up with autogenerated ones, which seems a shame.

If the file is largish this introduces an annoying pause. Using -L skips all that.Ctrl-R as the first character of a search string will search for that literal string, not the regular expression.

It provided for reasonably space-efficient, remote, versioned backups of a mail server, using hard links.That mail server used maildir, which...for those who are not familiar:  With maildir, each email message is a separate file on the disk.  Thus, there were a lot of folders that had many thousands of files in them.  Plus hardlinks for daily/weekly/whatever versions of each of those files.At the time there were those who were very vocal about their opinion of using maildir in this kind of capacity, likening it to abuse of the filesystem.  And if that was stupid, then my use of hard links certainly multiplied that stupidity.Perhaps I was simply not very smart at that time.But it was actually fun to fit that together, and it was kind of amazing to watch rsync perform this job both automatically and without complaint between a pair of particularly not-fast (256kbps?) DOCSIS connections from Roadrunner.It worked fine.  Whenever I needed to go back in time for some reason, the information was reliably present at the other end with adequate granularity -- with just a couple of cron jobs, rsync, and maybe a little bit of bash script to automate it all.",

I build these ISOs with nix. Nix sets the time to Jan 1st 1970 for reproducible builds, and I suspect the ISOs are padded out to the next sector.
