      "abstract": "Discord宣布下月起将要求用户通过人脸扫描或身份证验证才能获得完整服务权限，引发HackerNews社区热议。核心争议集中在隐私安全与未成年人保护之间的平衡。\n\n多数用户强烈反对这一政策，认为Discord作为游戏聊天平台强制收集生物识别信息过度侵犯隐私。有用户直言“绝不会为和朋友闲聊游戏而上传身份证”，也有用户指出此类验证通常外包给第三方公司，存在数据滥用风险。讨论中提到法国立法禁止15岁以下青少年使用社交媒体的案例，部分用户认为年龄验证应通过更去中心化的方式实现。\n\n在替代方案方面，社区积极探讨开源替代品，Matrix、Signal、IRC+Mumble等被多次提及。Zulip项目负责人借机推广其产品，获得部分用户认可。值得注意的是，有用户回忆早期互联网实名交流传统，暗示当前争议存在代际认知差异。\n\n尽管对验证方式存在分歧，社区普遍认同两个观点：一是应警惕以保护未成年人为名扩大监控的行业趋势；二是用户可通过取消Nitro订阅表达抗议。整体上，讨论呈现对科技公司集中掌控身份数据的深切忧虑，同时折射出对开放式通信协议的回归呼声。",

          "content": "I'm biased, as I lead the Zulip project. But I think this is a reasonable place for me to post some thoughts.Given current events in the USA, I can't emphasize enough how worried one should be about the fact that a few companies like Discord, Google (Gmail), and Meta have databases with access to the private conversations of hundreds of millions of people with their closest friends and family members, linked up with their identity.Some of the big strengths of running a self-hosted Zulip server for your community are:- Zulip servers are operationally simple, highly stable and easy to upgrade.- Zulip is much better than Discord or Slack for managing the firehose of busy communities. Or at least, a lot of people tell us that they prefer the user experience to everything else they've tried, after a few weeks of getting used to it. :)- Your community leaders get to make the policy decisions about data protection, identity, etc.- It's 100% FOSS software, with an extremely readable and maintainable codebase that ~1500 people have successfully contributed code to. I don't think you'll find modern alternatives with a comparable featureset to Discord that are more resilient to the sponsoring company being acquired or going out of business.- We are a values-focused organization (https://zulip.com/values/) where providing a public service is important to us all.- Each server is completely self-contained and independent, with the only centralized services needed from us being desktop/mobile app publication and mobile push notifications delivery (which is free for community use and soon to be E2EE).I'm happy to answer any questions.",

          "content_cn": "我承认自己有偏向性，因为我负责Zulip项目。但我觉得在此分享一些想法是合适的。鉴于美国当前局势，我必须强调：像Discord、谷歌（Gmail）和Meta这类公司掌握着数亿用户与亲友的私密对话数据库，且这些数据与真实身份关联——这一事实值得所有人高度警惕。\n\n为社群搭建自托管Zulip服务器的核心优势在于：\n- 运维简易、稳定性极高且升级便捷\n- 在管理高活跃度社群的信息洪流方面，Zulip远胜Discord或Slack。至少许多用户反馈称，适应数周后他们认为其体验优于其他所有尝试过的平台 :)\n- 社群管理者可自主制定数据保护、身份验证等政策\n- 这是100%开源软件，拥有约1500名贡献者共同维护的可读性极强代码库。目前市面上兼具Discord功能集、且能更好抵御收购或倒闭风险的现代替代品寥寥无几\n- 我们是价值观驱动的组织（https://zulip.com/values/），提供公共服务对我们全体成员至关重要\n- 每个服务器完全独立自治，仅需通过我们提供桌面/移动端..."

So if you want your self-hosted Zulip server to work with the Zulip client apps in the App Store and Play Store, you have to use Zulip's push server, and there's nothing Zulip can do to fix that.Matrix works analogously; if you use the Element app from the App Store or Play Store, then you're using Element's push notification server, even if your Matrix homeserver is self-hosted. It's possible that Element allows their server to be used gratis in situations where Zulip charges a fee, I don't know their policies or anything, but in principle Matrix still leaves you exactly as dependent on a third party's goodwill unless you make your friends install a privately distributed mobile app.Zulip IIUC does not restrict self-hosting of any feature that's technically possible to self-host.",

She gave them everything they asked for, but when Facebook reviewed the appeal, they closed her account permanently.I can't speak for every company, but I know with Facebook and Paypal, these requests generally are from automated systems and the chances of successfully reopening the account is well under 1%. The info you submit is not viewed by a human and the systems are mostly treated as a way to lighten the load on human support staff. They don't care if your account is reopened, they just want you to feel like you had a chance, did all you could, and then just give up.I discovered this about 20 years ago dealing with Paypal. I happened to know someone who worked in Paypal engineering at the time. I had a well established account, a Paypal debit card, linked accounts, etc., everything you could need to feel good about an account.Out of the blue it was suspended and I was sent into this system to send in verification documents. I gave everything it wanted. First it was ID, then a \"utility bill\" so I sent over my phone bill. That wasn't acceptable because it didn't prove I lived at my address for some reason, so I sent a natural gas bill. Even though that did have to be tied to a physical address (you can't deliver gas wirelessly!) I was asked for an electric bill. Then the lease. Then a bank statement. Every time I gave it pretty quickly. Then I was asked for a passport. I didn't have one. Suddenly that was the only thing that could unlock my account and as soon as they had the passport my account would be reopened. Nothing further would be done without a passport, not even communication.I asked my friend to look into it. She said, \"that's on purpose, that's the NoBot. It gets people out of support's hair.\" Turns out if you let unhappy customers complain to humans on the phone they will, so some exec decided to improve call center metrics by forcing customers into a system designed to keep them occupied until they gave up. You funneled people into it, and it would continue to reject their submissions with new reasons infinitely. It just went through a list of things to ask for, and when it found one you couldn't provide, suddenly that was the key and without it you were screwed.Companies still do this today.",

DMs/friend requests from people you don't know take some extra clicks to view. Fine.It depends on how broad the definition of adult content ends up being I guess, but I'm simply not convinced that requiring ID to view \"adult\" content is the end of the world. If that means porn, I'm 100% OK with it, put porn behind gates. It has become far too easy to access. It's 2026 and we now have a generation of gooning addicts out there who never have actual sex and it's basically a guarantee that they won't find partners or start families any time soon, exacerbating an already problematic decline in the birth rate. This is not a version of society or anyone's \"rights\" that I care to defend. You want to goon, show ID. That's how it was before the Internet anyway.On the other hand if it means any speech that the platform deems to be \"controversial\" will be blurred out then my response will not be to submit ID, I'll simply limit how I use the platform. Anonymous speech continues to matter and needs protection. But Discord was never the entity that was going to provide that protection.I mean Discord is a gaming chat room. Expectations should be set by that fact. I don't need a gaming chat room to be NSFW, or even host i.e. political speech really. I get that people have used it for more than gaming, but it was always pretty clear what it was. If people don't like that this gaming chat room no longer supports other uses, they should switch to an alternative.",

A big part of my motivation was that I felt that VC funding usually requires eventual enshittification. https://zulip.com/values/ talks more about this.- Zulip has been 100% FOSS software for more than a decade.- At the very beginning, we built a complete data import/export system that allows migrating between our Cloud hosting and self-hosting; we put a lot of care into maintaining it well.I can't promise that we'll never have something to sell for self-hosting communities. For example, I could imagine offering a paid add-on for encrypted backups.That said, I'd like to push back on the idea that charging businesses for a tool that's an important part of their daily work \"breaks the seal\". Organizations with a software budget should be happier to pay a fair price for ethical, user-first software from a friendly vendor than for a closed-source product from a megacorp.

Apparently, back then it didn't bother me much, but with age I became more cowardly, I must admit. So now I use my passport data more often than not, even though I am not really a fan of the idea of giving a scan of your documents to some random guy on AirBnB (although, with some obvious caption photoshopped on top, to make the scan less re-usable). I mean, it's just a matter of fact that everyone requires them, and it also has that weird status of \"semi-secret thing\" that you are somehow aren't supposed to give to anyone, and I still have close to zero understanding of how that works.So, I suppose you shouldn't give your fake id (digital or physical) to a government officials. It also seems \"obvious\" that it's similarly unwise to give it to a bank. But you can do that to a random guy on AirBnB? A hotel? To a delivery service (Uber/Wolt/whatever)? Dicsord?

          "content": "I recently retired after 37 years of working in tech so of course I am working on open source.My retirement treat was to spend three months learning OpenGL and 3D game programming by porting a classic Java RTS game, Tribal Trouble, to more modern OpenGL and Java. I learn much better working with real code and this was a great experience. It was certainly a different experience than it would have been without an LLM teacher, reviewer, helper, assistant. The app was beautifully designed and very cleanly implemented back in Java 1.4 days of 2004 so it has been a joy to modernize it while attempting to preserve the clean design.  The OpenGL work and the necessary math was a lot different than what I have been doing for most of my career so it was a lot of fun. I will probably continue tinkering with Tribal Trouble occasionally as I still enjoy playing the game. I want to learn Blender to edit/improve the 3D models. (https://github.com/bondolo/tribaltrouble)For now I have mostly moved on from gaming and am instead working on improving the accessibility (#a11y) of the Wireshark network protocol capture/analysis tool. There are a lot of blind and low vision IT folks for whom this tool is a job requirement. The current accessibility is unfortunately poor. I've submitted my first PR and am relearning the Wireshark source after last contributing 20 years ago. It's also been 15 years since the last time I did anything with Qt so that has been a refresher as well. I don't enjoy working in C++ but the goal matters so I will suffer through. (https://wireshark.org)I plan to work on Wireshark for a couple of months at least and then look for something else to contribute to, probably also accessibility related. I have some ideas already about next apps. I'm currently tempted to build an NFC app for iOS in Swift but haven't decided yet. After having built in the last year both Kotlin Compose and TypeScript React apps, none of which I enjoyed very much, I am somewhat curious if Swift and SwiftUI will be more fun.",

Happy to see someone executing it so well.For me, it started when I spent a year and a half reading and digesting books for and against young earth creationism, then eventually for Christianity itself (its historical truth claims). It struck me that the books were just a serialization of some knowledge structure that existed in the authors’ heads, and by reading I was trying to recreate that structure in my own head. And that’s a super inefficient way to go about this business. So there must be a shortcut, some more powerful intermediate representation than just text (text is too general and powerful, and you can’t compute over it… until now with LLMs?)That graph felt a lot like code to me: there’s no unique representation of knowledge in a graph, but there are some that are much more useful than others; building a well-factored graph takes time and taste; graphs are composable and reusable in a way that feels like it could help you discover layers of abstraction in your arguments.",

Claude will happily generate an ECS system or a scene manager, but it doesn't know your game's actual needs. Bad architecture early on will cost you weeks later.Start with a tiny scope (like a single-screen platformer), use Claude Code to move fast on the code side, but spend most of your energy on the parts AI can't help with — design and feel.Also, shameless plug,  if you want to skip the code entirely and just focus on making the game, that's what CraftMyGame is for.

          "content": "Thank you! I haven't tried circuitscript with LLMs yet, but I do plan to do so in the future. As the language is similar to python, hopefully it is able to work well syntactically. But of course, the correctness and accuracy of the circuit would be more challenging to get right. Your work at https://www.mikeayles.com/#tokn is very cool! This will be very useful when I try LLMs!I have seen both atopile and tscircuit too and they are really complete it terms of the entire PCB design flow compared to circuitscript, which is just focused on the schematic part.The ato language works well for specifying parts and parameters, but is very basic for defining connectivity. This means that the designer will have minimal control of how the final schematics will turn out. Of course, atopile focuses on the complete design flow, so having nice schematics could be a want rather than a need. For myself, especially in my professional job, clear and well-organized schematics are important not just for understanding and creation, but also troubleshooting the design and eventually improving the design.I did try some automatic layout features for the schematic that balances giving the user some control over the overall schematic, but this was really hard to get right. In the end, I went with the logo/turtle approach and give full layout control to the user.For tscircuit, I like typescript as a programming language and circuitscript itself is created in typescript. But typescript is really clunky to use for schematic design. Coupled with react, there is a lot of extra noise/symbols when looking at the code and for complex designs, it will be challenging to understand and troubleshoot. Moreover, I believe that typescript/javascript is less common among electronics engineers compared to python (which circuitscript is based on). The simplicity of python is one of the reasons it is popular and that is what I believe might help to lower the learning curve for circuitscript.",

The true disaster of that being that then testing out that installer on the developer's PC, where that CopyFiles may well work fine since the needed files happen to be sitting on that PC, would then lead on to think it was some weird bug that only failed on the end user's PC. I bet a lot of people posted it with comments like \"this worked fine when I tried it,\" and here we are a decade later feeding that to an LLM.These tools can write average code. That's what they've mostly been fed; that's what they're aiming for when they do their number crunching.

That itself, is seeing coding as a tool for income—which is valid.Calling it pathetic I think lacks empathy and perhaps an appreciation for what it might mean to other people outside the letters we type.

      "abstract": "该HackerNews帖子围绕用户对AI编程工具OpenClaw的体验展开讨论。核心话题是评估此类工具是否真能带来革命性的工作效率提升，还是仅为夸大宣传。\n\n社区观点分歧明显。许多用户批评原帖内容空洞，认为作者未展示任何实质性成果，并质疑OpenClaw的实际价值。有人指出，类似帖子常声称工具改变工作流程，却缺乏具体案例；也有用户强调，未见到基于OpenClaw开发的有益产品，甚至认为其已知作品质量低劣。同时，讨论中提到当前论坛可能存在大量人为操控的推广内容。\n\n不过，部分用户承认AI工具存在一定价值。有人认为，LLM能帮助启动项目、学习新知识，尤其当开发者缺乏动力时提供助力。但整体而言，社区普遍对原帖的模糊表述和过度宣传持怀疑态度，共识在于需要更具体的证据来验证AI编程工具的实际影响。",

          "content": "There's an odd trend with these sorts of posts where the author claims to have had some transformative change in their workflow brought upon by LLM coding tools, but also seemingly has nothing to show for it. To me, using the most recent ChatGPT Codex (5.3 on \"Extra High\" reasoning), it's incredibly obvious that while these tools are surprisingly good at doing repetitive or locally-scoped tasks, they immediately fall apart when faced with the types of things that are actually difficult in software development and require non-trivial amounts of guidance and hand-holding to get things right. This can still be useful, but is a far cry from what seems to be the online discourse right now.As a real world example, I was told to evaluate Claude Code and ChatGPT codex at my current job since my boss had heard about them and wanted to know what it would mean for our operations. Our main environment is a C# and Typescript monorepo with 2 products being developed, and even with a pretty extensive test suite and a nearly 100 line \"AGENTS.md\" file, all models I tried basically fail or try to shortcut nearly every task I give it, even when using \"plan mode\" to give it time to come up with a plan before starting. To be fair, I was able to get it to work pretty well after giving it extremely detailed instructions and monitoring the \"thinking\" output and stopping it when I see something wrong there to correct it, but at that point I felt silly for spending all that effort just driving the bot instead of doing it myself.It almost feels like this is some \"open secret\" which we're all pretending isn't the case too, since if it were really as good as a lot of people are saying there should be a massive increase in the number of high quality projects/products being developed. I don't mean to sound dismissive, but I really do feel like I'm going crazy here.",

Can Openclaw meet with contractors for me? None of them it can do. It can make notes for me (useless as most notes are useless). It can scrap websites for me (not very interesting as why would I want to collect so much knowledge?). It can probably automate anything that already has an endpoint or whatever, but I don’t mind write code for my own projects.

I learned a lot of command like tools and trucks by seeing what Claude does. Doing short scripts for stuff is super useful. Of course, the catch here is if you don't know stuff you can't drive it very well. So you need to use the things in isolation.- exploring alternative solutions. Stuff that by definition you don't know. Of course, some will not work, but it widens your horizon- exploring unfamiliar codebases. It can ingest huge amounts of data so exploration will be faster. (But less comprehensive than if you do it yourself fully)- maintaining change consistency. This I think it's just better than humans. If you have stuff you need to change at 2 or 3 places, you will probably forget. LLM's are better at keeping consistency at details (but not at big picture stuff, interestingly.)",

GPT-5.2 xhigh is a marvel at this stuff.My codebases are scala, pekko, typescript/react, and lilypond - yeah, the best models even understand lilypond now so I can give it a leadsheet and have it arrange for me two-hand jazz piano exercises.I generally think that if people can't reach the above level of success at this point in time, they need to think more about how to communicate better with the models.

With Claude, I just write \"Create a customer demo in Python that handles rate limits. Use example.com/docs/javascript/rate-limit-example as a reference,\" and it gets me 95% of the way there.There are probably 100 other small examples like this where I had the \"vibe\" to know where the customer might trip over, but not the time to plug up all the little documentation example holes myself.

It would have been hundreds of hours before, with maybe 12 hours of Claude code I’m almost there (some nagging issues… maybe another hour).That’s so nebulous and likely just plain wrong. I have some experience with silicone molds and casting silicone and other materials. I have no idea how you’d accurately estimate it would take hundreds of hours. But the mostly likely reason you’ve had results is that you just did it.This sounds very very much like confirmation bias. “I started drinking pine needle tea and then 5 days later my cold got better!”I use AI, it’s useful for lots of things, but this kind of anecdote is terrible evidence.",

It has a lot of files that it loads into it's context for each conversation, and it consistently updates them. Plus it stores and can reference each conversation. So there's a sense of continuity over time.2. It connects to messaging services and other accounts of yours, so again it feels continuous. You can use it on your desktop and then pick up your phone and send it an iMessage.3. It hooks into a lot of things, so it feels like it has more agency. You could send it a voice message over discord and say \"hey remember that conversation about birds? Send an email to Steve and ask him what he thinks about it\"It feels more like a smart assistant that's always around than an app you open to ask questions to.However, it's worth stressing how terrible the software actually is. Not a single thing I attempted to do worked correctly, important issues (like the discord integration having huge message delays and sometimes dropping messages) get closed because \"sorry we have too many issues\", and I really got the impression that the whole thing is just a vibe coded pile of garbage. And I don't like to be that critical about an open source project like this, but I think considering the level of hype and the dramatic claims that humans shouldn't be writing code anymore, I think it's worth being clear about.Ended up deleting it and setting up something much simpler. I installed a little discord relay called kimaki, and that lets me interact with instances of opencode over discord when I want to. I also spent some time setting up persistent files and made sure the llm can update them, although only when I ask it to in this case.

LLM's are better at keeping consistency at details (but not at big picture stuff, interestingly.)I use Claude Code a decent amount, and I actually find that sometimes this can be the opposite for me. Sometimes it is actually missing other areas that the change will impact and causing things to break. Sometimes when I go to test it I need to correct it and point out it missed something or I notice when in the planning phase that it is missing something.However I do find if you use a more powerful opus model when planning, it does consider things fully a lot better than it used to. This is actually one area I have been seeing some very good improvements as the models and tooling improves.In fact, I actually hope that these AI tools keep getting better at the point you mention, as humans also have a \"context limit\". There are only so many small details I can remember about the codebase so it is good if AI can \"remember\" or check these things.I guess a lot of the AI can also depend on your codebase itself, how you prompt it, and what kind of agents file you have. If you have a robust set of tests for your application you can very easily have AI tools check their work to ensure things aren't being broken and quickly fix it before even completing the task. If you don't have any testing more could be missed. So I guess it's just like a human in some sense.

Said something double-plus-ungood on Twitter? Denounced. Accepted contribution from someone on a prominent denouncelist? Denouced. Not that it was not possible to create such lists before, but it was all informal.The real problem are reputation-farmers. They open hundreds of low-effort PRs on GitHub in the hope that some of them get merged. This will increase the reputation of their accounts, which they hope will help them stand out when applying for a job. So the solution would be for GitHub to implement a system to punish bad PRs. Here is my idea:- The owner of a repo can close a PR either neutrally (e.g. an earnest but misguided effort was made), positively (a valuable contribution was made) or negatively (worthless slop)- Depending on how the PR was closed the reputation rises or drops- Reputation can only be raised or lowered when interacting with another repoThe last point should prevent brigading, I have to make contact with someone before he can judge me, and he can only judge me once per interaction. People could still farm reputation by making lots of quality PRs, but that's actually a good thing. The only bad way I can see this being gamed is if a bunch of buddies get together and merge each other's garbage PRs, but people can already do that sort of thing. Maybe the reputation should not be a total sum, but per project? Anyway, the idea is for there to be some negative consequences for people opening junk PRs.",

As the barrier to entry to the internet writ large dropped to near zero, communities that were built around the bygone era's natural filtering suffered. Communities must now establish filters proactively.Ultimately, you need to choose: does your community prioritize its short-term health, or ease of access? If a community never lets anyone in, then it withers and dies eventually, but in the meantime the community can be extremely high-trust. That's what happened to fraternal orders like the Oddfellows and the Free Masons post-Vietnam. If the community has zero barrier to entry, you end up with Twitter: a teeming mass of low-trust members screaming into the void.The happy medium is allowing in new members just as fast as you can build trust and community cohesion. University clubs are a good example of this: at a massive turnover rate of 25% per year, they need to form processes to not just recruit that many people, but integrate that big of a chunk of their community without destroying the high-trust environment.

This system exists because open source works on a system of trust, and AI has unfortunately made it so we can no longer trust-by-default because it makes it too trivial to generate plausible-looking but actually low-quality contributions.===Looking at the closed PRs of this very project immediately shows https://github.com/mitchellh/vouch/pull/28 - which, true to form, is an AI generated PR that might have been tested and thought through by the submitter, but might not have been! The type of thing that can frustrate maintainers, for sure.But how do you bootstrap a vouch-list without becoming hostile to new contributors? This seems like a quick way for a project to become insular/isolationist. The idea that projects could scrape/pull each others' vouch-lists just makes that a larger but equally insular community. I've seen well-intentioned prior art in other communities that's become downright toxic from this dynamic.So, if the goal of this project is to find creative solutions to that problem, shouldn't it avoid dogfooding its own most extreme policy of rejecting PRs out of hand, lest it miss a contribution that suggests a real innovation?",

It was a lack of appropriate following distance. Because I'd follow the drivers in front of me too closely I'd have to brake hard if they did... Or if they drive normally and happened to have a turn coming up.Over the period I had the insurance spy box in my truck I learned without thinking about it to increase my following distance, which meant that riding with me as a passenger was more comfortable and it beeped less often. Of course since I'd been so naughty early during the evaluation they didn't decrease my rates, but I think the training probably did make me statistically less likely to crash.",

Easy to digest. We'll then keep doing it over and over again because we never changed the circumstances.The second approach is holistic, for example even if the pilot made a mistake, why did they make a mistake, and what can we do to prevent that mistake (e.g. training, culture, etc)? But maybe other elements also played a part like mechanical, software, airport lightning, communications, etc.I bet everyone reading this knows of a road near them that is an accident hotspot and I bet they can explain WHY it is.

San Jose Mercury News readers voted that exact location as the worst interchange in the entire Bay Area in a 2018 reader poll [1]It's not a lack of knowledge by Caltrans or Santa Clara County's congestion management agency that is keeping that interchange as-is. Rather, it's the physical constraints of a nearby airport (so no room for flyovers), a nearby river (so probably no tunneling), and surrounding private landowners and train tracks.Leaving aside the specifics of the 880/101 interchange, the Google blog post suggests that they'll use this worst-case scenario on a limited access freeway to inform their future machine-learning analyses of other roads around the country, including ones where presumably there are also pedestrians and cyclists.No doubt some state departments of transportation will line up to buy these new \"insights\" from Google (forgetting that they actually already buy similar products from TomTom, Inrix, StreetLight, et al.)

So now I have a lot more free time for the hard stuff.I don't let the AI near the hard stuff as it often gets confused and I don't save much time. I might still use it as a thought partner, but don't give it access to make changes.Example: this morning I combined two codebases into one. I wrote both of them and had  a good understanding of how everything worked. I had an opinion about some things I wanted to change while combining the two projects. I also had a strong opinion about how I wanted the two projects to interact with each other. I think it would have taken me about 2 workdays to get this done. Instead, with AI tooling, I got it done in 3 or so hours. I fired up another LLM to do the code review, and it found some stuff both I and the other LLM missed.

I have experience AI’s deleting things they shouldn’t but not since like, the gpt4 days.But that put aside, I don’t agree with the premise. It doesn’t make the hard parts harder, if you ACTUALLY spend half the time you’d have ORIGINALLY spent on the hard problem carefully building context and using smart prompting strategies. If you try and vibe code a hard problem in a one shot, you’re either gonna have a bad time straight away or you’re gonna have a bad time after you try and do subsequent prompting on the first codebase it spits out.People are terrible observers of time. If you would’ve taken a week to build something, they try with AI for 2 hours and end up with a mess and claim either it’s not saving them any time or it’s making them code so bad it loses them time in the long run.If instead they spent 8 hours slowly prompting bit by bit with loads of very specific requirements, technical specifications on exactly the code architecture it should follow with examples, build very slowly feature by feature, make it write tests and carefully add your own tests, observe it from the ground up and build a SOLID foundation, and spend day 2 slowly refining details and building features ONE BY ONE, you’d have the whole thing done in 2 days, and it’d be excellent quality.But barely anyone does it this way. They vibe code it and complain that after 3 non specific prompts the ai wasn’t magically perfect.After all these years of engineers complaining that their product manager or their boss is an idiot because they gave vague instructions and demanded it wasn’t perfect when they didn’t provide enough info, you’d think they’d be better at it given the chance. But no, in my experience coaching prompting, engineers are TERRIBLE at this. Even simple questions like “if I sent this prompt to you as an engineer, would you be able to do it based on the info here?” are things they don’t ask themselves.Next time you use ai, imagine being the ai. Imagine trying to deliver the work based on the info you’ve been given. Imagine a boss that stamped their foot if it wasn’t perfect first try. Then, stop writing bad prompts.Hard problems are easier with ai, if you treat hard problems with the respect they deserve. Almost no one does./rant",

If your codebase has bad foundation and going in the wrong direction with lots of hacks, it will just write code which mirrors the existing style... And you get exactly was OP is suggesting.If however, your code foundations are good and highly consistent and never allow hacks, then the AI will maintain that clean style and it becomes shockingly good; in this case, the prompting barely even matters. The code foundation is everything.But I understand why a lot of people are still having a poor experience. Most codebases are bad. They work (within very rigid constraints, in very specific environments) but they're unmaintainable and very difficult to extend; require hacks on top of hacks. Each new feature essentially requires a minor or major refactoring; requiring more and more scattered code changes as everything is interdependent (tight coupling, low cohesion). Productivity just grinds to a slow crawl and you need 100 engineers to do what previously could have been done with just 1. This is not a new effect. It's just much more obvious now with AI.I've been saying this for years but I think too few engineers had actually built complex projects on their own to understand this effect. There's a parallel with building architecture; you are constrained by the foundation of the building. If you designed the foundation for a regular single storey house, you can't change your mind half-way through the construction process to build a 20-storey skyscraper. That said, if your foundation is good enough to support a 100 storey skyscraper, then you can build almost anything you want on top.My perspective is if you want to empower people to vibe code, you need to give them really strong foundations to work on top of. There will still be limitations but they'll be able to go much further.My experience is; the more planning and intelligence goes into the foundation, the less intelligence and planning is required for the actual construction.",

I've been measuring what actually happens inside AI coding sessions; over 60% of what the model sees is file contents and command output, stuff you never look at. Nobody did the work of understanding by building / designing it. You're reviewing code that nobody understood while writing it, and the model is doing the same.This is why the evaluation problem is so problematic. You skipped building context to save time, but now you need that context to know if the output is any good. The investigation you didn't do upfront is exactly what you need to review the AI's work.",

      "abstract": "该讨论围绕MIT生活工资计算器的准确性和适用性展开。核心争议在于计算模型是否真实反映生活成本，以及“生活工资”这一概念本身是否合理。\n\n多数用户质疑计算数据的时效性和假设条件。有人认为住房成本严重低估，指出实际租金远高于计算结果；也有用户指出医疗和交通等项目存在明显高估，与个人经验不符。讨论中提到，部分数据可能基于消费调查，反映的是人们的消费习惯而非基本需求。\n\n对于“生活工资”的责任归属存在分歧。有观点认为私营企业只需支付市场工资，不应承担保障生活水平的责任；相反意见则暗示生产率提升未被合理分配。此外，计算器忽略波多黎各等地区也引发不满。\n\n普遍共识是当前模型存在缺陷，难以统一适用于不同家庭结构和地区。计算结果显示本地中位数家庭收入不足“生活工资”的情况，被许多用户认为脱离现实，凸显了标准化衡量工具的局限性。",

Do you have access to a grandmother who can babysit? A decent second-hand car? A good roommate situation? Just look at the expense table - any one of these things could be worth up to 20% of your income!And you see that literally right here - are any of us actually comfortable with the idea that the value of your labor should be determined by your marriage status and number of children?It's kind of telling that countries with \"successful\" minimum wages either don't have one and just institutionalize collective bargaining, or they do some fancy calculations that start with prevailing median wages and welfare eligibility. The idea of trying to get this number from the bottom up by building expenses just doesn't seem very robust.",

The government kept on getting raked over the coals by charities who claimed that people working minimum wage were in poverty and so our govenrment bumped the minimum wage by a bit and then announced it as \"This is the new NATIONAL LIVING WAGE\". Which is just perfect politics. You're the government, so you can just take a term. Trump can brand the Gulf of America, and the UK Tories can just redefine the living wage. Now those charities are stuffed because any time they talk about a living wage everyone gets confused, it cuts the legs out of the conversation.The core of the problem is that you basically have to have someone define what is an acceptable standard of living. Sharing a flat? Nah, the MIT trained economist thinks that's for the poverty people so that is defined as below living wage. Walk to work? No. You need atleast $10k a year on travel otherwise you're a bus wanker.A huge amount of this is value judgements on what is an acceptable standard of living from people who benefit from immense privilege but will never experience the thing they're studying.",

Even if you and I agree on the ends, if you use the means of exaggerating or stretching the truth to get there, you are never on my side. Saying that you need to not have roommates to live is an exaggeration.> Renting a private room was possible on nearly any wage 50 years agoYou will never find any data to support that because it isn't true. 50 years ago, flophouses were common. You would share a bedroom room with others, with shared kitchen and bathroom between multiple bedrooms. In college, I lived in a housing-coop network where we slept two to a room. 50 years ago, they slept 4 or 6 to a room in my exact house.> and the only reason it seems out of reach for many now is because purchasing power has been slowly stagnating for decades, while housing costs have soared in recent timesThis is true. But there is a very natural reason why. Look at nearly any US city, and see how many more jobs there are in that city than there were 50 years ago. Then look at how many more homes there are in that city than there were 50 years ago. You will see that the number of new jobs far exceeds the number of new homes. The result is that wealthier people bid up the housing, while poor people are forced to live outside the city and commute. So why have no new houses been built? It can't be helped by the fact that building new homes is illegal. (e.g. buildings with 3 or more apartments are illegal in 70% of san francisco.)Please direct your anger in the right direction! It's not generally the case that billionaires own thousands of homes, hoarding them while the poor live on the street. It's more often the case that the population has increased while the number of homes in places people want to live has stayed the same. The *only* solution is to increase the number of homes in places people want to live. Raising the minimum wage, taxing the rich, fighting corporations, adding rent control laws, none of that will help solve the root of the problem, the growth rate of homes in cities is far slower than the rate of people wanting to live there!",

We urge control and supervision by the nation as an antidote to the movement for state socialism.

I have a ton of nostalgia for it though.Civ5 started the whole hex thing, which I was never excited about. Yes, Civ4 had stacks of doom but Civ5 turned into a puzzle of moving units in order because you could only have one per hex.Anyway, Civ2 and Civ3 never got as much play from me. I'm a little surprised that people had the same enthusiasm. My memory of these 2 was that they just added a bunch of tedium, like I distinctly remember that tile improvement changed to turning farms into supermarkets. It's been a lot of years so I might be misremembering. Maybe I just dind't give them enough time. Or maybe nothing could capture my initial enthusiasm for the novelty that was Civ1.Anyway, i'm always happy to see projects like this. Games really do live forever. Like people will invent software for free to keep running them (ie emulators).The Civ series has kinda defied the usual trend to entshittification. I'm really thinking of SimCity here. It's hard to describe how much EA shit the bed with SimCity %, so much so that it basically launched Cities: Skylines, which itself has had issues with the CS2 launch.Does Civ3 have a massive fanbase compared to Civ1, Civ2 or Civ4? I really don't know.[1]: https://forums.civfanatics.com/threads/mod-fall-from-heaven-...",

My main requirement to enjoy a language deeply is often simplicity, so I love languages like, C, Golang, Odin and Zig.That said, I also acknowledge that often times I need to solve problems that can benefit from a language that embraces what I call necessary complexity, but do it in elegant ways. Whenever I need to prioritise code correctness, especially memory and concurrency safety, using a mostly functional pattern instead of OOP, but without going as extreme as say Haskell, I unquestionably choose Rust, my favourite complex language. I often work with network code that is highly concurrent, must be as correct as possible and benefits from good performance, so then again, Rust feels natural here.On the other hand, I love coding simple indie games and for that particular case, I like a simple and performant language using an imperative, non-OOP style. In my opinion C, and in particular Odin more recently are quite a good fit. If Jonathan happens to be reading this comment, since he mentioned Golang, I would suggest him Odin as perhaps the best of both worlds between C and Golang. It has all the simplicity of Golang, but without a garbage collector, plus it is quite easy to code a game using Raylib.",

Software that delivers a lot of value is usually developed and evolved not only by team, but by a team with changing members and changing leadership over the project's lifetime. The features used will be the union of all features used over the years, and while it's easy for team leads to allow the use of more features than their predecessors, it's quite hard to reduce them.Also, you may be forced to use language features you don't want if they're used by libraries whose functionality you do want. For example, when doing low-level programming, I don't like implicit calls that I can't clearly see on the page (e.g. destructors or overloaded operators).

That can work if you have strong architectural discipline and are willing to pay the upfront cost. Most teams are not.I agree on C++ being the worst of both worlds for many people. You get abstraction, but also an enormous semantic surface area and footguns everywhere. Java is interesting because the core language is indeed small and boring in a good way, much closer to C than people admit.

      "abstract": "该讨论围绕苹果芯片中能效核心（E核）的性能优势展开。用户普遍认同E核通过处理后台任务释放性能核心（P核）资源，从而提升整体系统响应速度。有用户指出，E核性能已接近旧款Intel i5/i7桌面处理器，且能效表现突出。\n\n讨论中主要争议点集中在任务调度机制上：部分用户担心工具按核心数分配线程可能导致E核拖慢关键进程，特别是在M1芯片的均衡架构下；另有用户询问macOS调度算法是否简单按I/O阻塞或时间片超时来分配任务。此外，有用户提及Linux系统（如Asahi）对异构核心的调度优化仍处于探索阶段。\n\n尽管存在技术细节分歧，社区普遍认可苹果芯片的整体性能优势，尤其是P核在高负载任务中的出色表现。也有用户通过跨平台测试指出，M系列芯片在部分场景中甚至超越高端Windows桌面处理器。",

Software has bloated to slow down MacBooks again, RAM can often be a major limiting factor in performance, and battery life is more variable now.Intel is finally catching up to Apple for the first time since 2020. Panther Lake is very competitive on everything except single-core performance (including battery life). Panther Lake CPU's arguably have better features as well - Intel QSV is great if you compile ffmpeg to use it for encoding, and it's easier to use local AI  models with OpenVINO than it is to figure out how to use the Apple NPU's. Intel has better tools for sampling/tracing performance analysis, and you can actually see you're loading the iGPU (which is quite performant) and how much VRAM you're using. Last I looked, there was still no way to actually check if an AI model was running on Apple's CPU, GPU, or NPU. The iGPU's can also be configured to use varying amounts of system RAM - I'm not sure how that compares to Apple's unified memory for effective VRAM, and Apple has higher memory bandwidth/lower latency.I'm not saying that Intel has matched Apple, but it's competitive in the latest generation.",

So if you have a high-priority (UserInitiated) process, and it makes an IPC call out to a daemon that is usually a low-priority background daemon, the high-priority process passes a voucher to the low-priority one, which allows the daemon’s ipc handling thread to run high-priority (and thus access P-cores) so long as it’s holding the voucher.This lets Apple architect things as small, single-responsibility processes, but make their priority dynamic, such that they’re usually low-priority unless a foreground user process is blocked on their work.

          "content": "It's the combination of the two that yields the best of both worlds.Android SoCs have adopted heterogenous CPU architectures (\"big.LITTLE\" in the ARM sphere) years before Apple, and as a result, there have been multiple attempts to tackle this in Linux. The latest, upstream, and perhaps the most widely deployed way of efficiently using such processors involves using Energy-Aware Scheduling [1]. This allows the kernel to differentiate between performant and efficient cores, and schedule work accordingly, avoiding situations in which brief workloads are put on P cores and the demanding ones start hogging E cores. Thanks to this, P cores can also be put to sleep when their extra power is not needed, saving power.One advantage macOS still has over Linux is that its kernel can tell performance-critical and background workloads apart without taking guesses. This is beneficial on all sorts of systems, but particularly shines on those heterogenous ones, allowing unimportant workloads to always occupy E cores, and freeing P cores for loads that would benefit from them, or simply letting them sleep for longer. Apple solved this problem by defining a standard interface for the user-space to communicate such information down [2]. As far as I'm aware, Linux currently lacks an equivalent [3].Technically, your application can still pin its threads to individual cores, but to know which core is which, it would have to parse information internal to the scheduler. I haven't seen any Linux application that does this.[1] https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/scheduler/sched-energ...[2] https://developer.apple.com/library/archive/documentation/Pe...[3] https://github.com/swiftlang/swift-corelibs-libdispatch?tab=...",

By contrast multicore machines weren’t common in the Windows/x86 world until around the late 2000s with the boom of Intel’s Core series CPUs, but single core x86 CPUs persisted for several years following and Windows developer culture still hasn’t embraced multithreading as fully as its Mac counterpart has.This then made it dead simple for Mac developers to adopt task prioritization/QoS. Work was already cleanly split into threads, so it’s just a matter of specifying which are best suited for putting on e-cores and which to keep on P-cores. And overwhelmingly, Mac devs have done that.So the system scheduler is a good deal more effective than its Windows counterpart because third party devs have given it cues to guide it. The tasks most impactful to the user’s perception of snappiness remain on the P-cores, the E-cores stay busy with auxiliary work and keep the P-cores unblocked and able to sleep more quickly and often.",

Since the only thing I would use Spotlight for is searching through applications to start, I changed the Cmd+Space keybind to launch the Applications view. The search is instant.Spotlight, aside from failing to find applications also pollutes the search results with random files it found on the filesystem, some shortcuts to search the web and whatnot. Also, at the start of me using a Mac it repeatedly got into the state of not displaying any results whatsoever. Fixing that each time required running some arcane commands in the terminal. Something that people associate with Linux, but ironically I think now Linux requires less of that than Mac.But in Tahoe they removed the Applications view, so my solution is gone now.All in all, with Apple destroying macOS in each release, crippling DTrace with SIP, Liquid Glass, poor performance monitoring compared to what I can see with tools like perf on Linux, or Intel VTune on Windows, Metal slowly becoming the only GPU programming option, I think I’m going to be switching back to Linux.",

That's a monitoring and alerting problem, not just an infrastructure one.At some point the conversation needs to shift from \"GitHub is down again\" to \"why are so many engineering orgs single-threaded on a platform they don't control and can't observe independently?\" Git is distributed by design.

Being multi-turn with long range consequences the only way to truly learn and play “the game” is to experience significant amounts of it. Embody an adversarial lawyer, a software engineer trying to get projects through a giant org..My suspicion is agents can’t play as equals until they start to act as full participants - very sci fi indeed..Putting non-humans into the game can’t help but change it in new ways - people already decry slop and that’s only humans acting in subordination to agents. Full agents - with all the uncertainty about intentions - will turn skepticism up to 11.“Who’s playing at what” is and always was a social phenomenon, much larger than any multi turn interaction, so adding non-human agents looks like today’s game, just intensified. There are ever-evolving ways to prove your intentions & human-ness and that will remain true. Those who don’t keep up will continue to risk getting tricked - for example by scammers using deepfakes. But the evolution will speed up and the protocols to become trustworthy get more complex..Except in cultures where getting wasted is part of doing business. AI will have it tough there :)",

You can also have e.g. convolutional language models or LSTM-based language models. This is a basic point that anyone with any proper understanding of these models would know.Even if you disagree with these semantics, the major LLMs today are primarily trained on natural language. But, yes, as I said in another comment on this thread, it isn't that simple, because LLMs today are trained on tokens from tokenizers, and these tokenizers are trained on text that includes e.g. natural language, mathematical symbolism, and code.Yes, humans have incredibly limited access to the real world. But they experience and model this world with far more tools and machinery than language. Sometimes, in certain cases, they attempt to messily translate this messy, multimodal understanding into tokens, and then make those tokens available on the internet.An LLM (in the sense everyone means it, which, again, is largely a natural language model, but certainly just a tokenized text model) has access only to these messy tokens, so, yes, far less capacity than humanity collectively. And though the LLM can integrate knowledge from a massive amount of tokens from a huge amount of humans, even a single human has more different kinds of sensory information and modality-specific knowledge than the LLM. So humans DO have more privileged access to the real world than LLMs (even though we can barely access a slice of reality at all).",

But funnily, for an ideal gas (such as our atmosphere), the formula works out to be the same.So, \"Rayleigh scattering\" is the common term still used today, but there is a deeper reason for the formula being correct — it remains correct even when molecules are relatively close together, such as in the lower layers of our atmosphere.I found this nice paper[1] giving an overview of the timeline, various discoveries, etc: http://users.df.uba.ar/bragas/Web%20roberto/Papers/sobelman%...",

In any case, they means the same thing  There's nothing ambiguous or inconsistent about this. In English a verb is transitive if it takes one or more objects in addition to the subject. In \"Anna carries a book\", \"carries\" is transitive. A verb is intransivite if it takes no object as with \"jumps\" in \"The frog jumps.\".Many verbs in English are \"ambitransitive\" where they can either take an object or not, and the meaning often shifts depending on how it's used. There is a whole category of verbs called \"labile verbs\" where the subject of the intransitive form becomes the object of the transitive form:* Intransitive: The bell rang.* Transitive: John rang the bell.\"Scatter\" is simply a labile verb:* Intransitive: Blue light scatters.* Transitive: Atmospheric molecules scatter blue light more.",

The strength of those responses is what your brain uses to interpret the color that you see.The real problem is that out in space there is no attenuation of sunlight, it's bright. Super crazy bright. It basically overloads all of your Cones, and Rods, all at once, there is no way for your brain to find a signal of \"oh there's more higher wavelengths here so interpret bluer than normal\" because all of the signals got maxed out.

If your software interpolates based on hue, you might see green (or purple) in the middle. But that's not physically realistic.A realistic model is to interpolate each wavelength of the continuous spectrum separately. Interpolating in RGB color space is a crude approximation to this.

One of the primary requirements was that even our non-technical friends should be able to use it.At the time Matrix/Element had recently launched their Matrix 2.0 efforts and I tried setting up the whole stack without resorting to their all in one shell-script meant for non-production use. I did not mind hosting four different servers (Synapse, Matrix Auth Service (MAS), Call, etc), but did find the integration and config job a bit tedious. The main blocker though was the lack of an invite-system in the new Matrix Auth Server. Also the fact that the Element X app uses a new Livekit based call server while other clients/apps use a different approach is also something not great.We ended up going for Mattermost. One service easily hosted with Docker. One app, and easy invites. While I think federation would be cool, right now Mattermost was a bit simpler to get up and running.Element seems more focused on enterprise and government contracts than self-hosters. I think this is fine, they need to pay their bills. But Matrix 2.0 for self-hosters might need a better story right now.",

The overall experience of using Matrix has a lot of catching up to do. Like many others on HN I was enthusiastic about it early on, but I’ve been so worn down by all of the little problems, random re-authentication issues that nobody can explain, and missing features that I found myself avoiding using it unless I really needed to talk to someone I couldn’t contact any other way.You can find isolated success stories about small groups who successfully use it for their group chat, but at the root of all of those stories is always one person who takes the role of very dedicated IT person to keep it all running and walk others through steps to fix it when it breaks.They’ve been churning a lot on features and design, which has added another layer of fatigue on top of it all. It’s hard to even discuss Matrix any more because every negative experience will get waved away with an explanation that it was a problem with an old app or version and you just need to try Element X and Matrix 2.0 or the newest release. However, it’s felt that way for years. I’ll revisit it again in a year but for now I’ve reached my limit for how much time I can put into trying to make a project work and stay working.",

That's the main obstacle of Matrix's adaption I think.Matrix tries to copy-cat all these other products. But in the end it feels like something trying to be all sorts of things and not quite doing it as well as the originals in every way. Plus you have this \"confusing\" security/crypto aspect. And then you have the whole issue with inconsistencies between clients.You have to really commit to it, or matrix has to be the backend of some other more refined/specific app (like chat section on websites, like Disqus).In my opinion, if you want Matrix adaption, stop talking about Matrix adaption, that's like talking about HTTP adaption. You want people to use clients, talk about clients. Let's talk about \"Element\" adaption. (side-chat: Please make names more searchable. ok, you want to use this generic/confusing term \"Element\", can you at least make it unique by calling it \"Elemnt\" with a weird spelling so it's more searchable?)People don't like learning new and complex systems for the sake of it. It's a chore. I want to be able to tell people \"let's use Element\" and explain why they should use it. It would help if it had original features other products didn't have that it does really well. It's been over a year since i used Element, but I didn't like the UI at all, it felt like Teams but more clunky? perhaps the mobile app is better, I never tried it.All that said, I think it's a great system, it's perfect for government systems too. they're not usually concerned about things looking great or having cosmetic features.

When I last looked (around 2024), the libraries maintained by the Matrix.org core team did.This means that, while Megolm has a ratchet that can be used to provide forward security, no Matrix implementation that I am aware of does this. This seems to me to be because other features of the Matrix specification rely on continued access to these old keys (like Megolm key backups and history sharing).Re. security of new keys/sessions/messages after compromise of some current state (i.e. notions like post-compromise security, future secrecy):My understanding is that, while a _sender_ will rotate Megolm sessions every 100 or so messages, recipients tend not to: clients will accept ciphertexts sent from those old sessions for an indefinite period of time. Again, I haven't been following developments in the Matrix world for a little while, so please correct me if I'm wrong.This seems (to me) to be for similar reasons to the above: recipients keep around the recipient sessions so they can be backed up and shared with new devices (for history sharing). But (!) Matrix could get way better authentication guarantees if they just _disabled accepting messages_ from these old sessions at the same schedule as the sender stops using them.--These are not a unreasonable compromises (there aren't too many attempts to square this circle, and most that I'm aware of are quite academic) but it's worth making clear that just because Olm/Megolm/the Matrix spec have particular features, it doesn't mean they are used properly to give the security guarantees we would naively expect from their composition.

A typical Node.js project pulls in 800+ transitive dependencies, each with their own release cadence and breaking change policies. Nobody on your team understands how most of them work internally, and that's fine - until one of them ships a breaking change, deprecates an API, or hits end-of-life.The anon291 comment about interface stability is exactly right. The reason you don't need to understand CPU microarchitecture is that x86 instructions from 1990 still work. Your React component library from 2023 might not survive the next major version. The \"nobody knows how the whole system works\" problem is manageable when the interfaces are stable and well-documented. It becomes genuinely dangerous when the interfaces themselves are churning.What I've noticed is that teams don't even track which of their dependencies are approaching EOL or have known vulnerabilities at the version they're pinned to. The knowledge gap isn't just \"how does this work\" - it's \"is this thing I depend on still actively maintained, and what changed in the last 3 releases that I skipped?\" That's the operational version of this problem that bites people every week.",

I am also probably an outlier, and the product of various careers, with a small dose of autism sprinkled in. My first career was as a Submarine Nuclear Electronics Technician / Reactor Operator in the U.S. Navy. As part of that training curriculum, I was taught electronics theory, troubleshooting, and repair, which begins with \"these are electrons\" and ends with \"you can now troubleshoot a VMEbus [0] Motorola 68000-based system down to the component level.\" I also later went back to teach at that school, and rewrote the 68000 training curriculum to use the Intel 386 (progress, eh?).Additionally, all submariners are required to undergo an oral board before being qualified, and analogous questions like that are extremely common, e.g. \"I am a drop of seawater. How do I turn the light on in your rack?\" To answer that question, you end up drawing (from memory) an enormous amount of systems and connecting them together, replete with the correct valve numbers and electrical buses, as well as explaining how all of them work, and going down various rabbit holes as the board members see fit, like the throttling characteristics of a gate valve (sub-optimal). If it's written down somewhere, or can be derived, it's fair game. And like TFA's discussion about Brendan Gregg's practice of finding someone's knowledge limit, the board members will not stop until they find something you don't know - at which point you are required to find it out, and get back to them.When I got into tech, I applied this same mindset. If I don't know something, I find out. I read docs, I read man pages, I test assumptions, I tinker, I experiment. This has served me well over the years, with seemingly random knowledge surfacing during an incident, or when troubleshooting. I usually don't remember all of it, but I remember enough to find the source docs again and refresh my memory.0: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/VMEbus",

Deadlines are only shortened down the chain, never extended.  The assumption is that if it cannot be done then they will simply not administer any consequences and classify it as \"not realizing the upside\".The only reason it is almost always and not always, is because sometimes a different thing pops up that needs to get prioritized first, so it is communicated that the first thing isnt actually as important as it was yesterday and this other thing is now the most important.Now obviously I cant speak for everyone at all teams, but as far as boring corporate default behavior goes this is the safe path for executives.  If your boss is doing otherwise, they are going out of their way to do it.The takeaway as a worker is that you should not treat any business goal or deadline ask of you with the same level of care as you would a personal favor.  When something really needs that level of care, your boss should pull you aside and break character and make it a personal favor to them, not the business.As far as \"Ownership\" goes, it is just a pissing contest as far as I can tell.  if you own a task but cant do the task, you just send an email to someone who can do the task so that the task gets done and you can report the task is done and get your ownership credit.  the person who did the task was used as a tool in this regard.  So high performing managers just try to get ownership of as much as they possibly can, as there's no meaningful difference between who sends that email.",

Modern society has an insane demand for transportation. Roads – the medium on which we transport things – are the fabric on which cities are built. Not just inside the cities, but the vast network of roads outside the city, that feed it.Before the 1900s, we weren't able to build cities far from water because of their demand for transportation.

I had the same obsession with roads, from SimCity onward; they're the circulatory system of any city, and never in the history of cities or the history of circulatory systems have the vessels been straight lines. The streets of a European or Asian village usually tell a story about how roads were built over the fastest footpath from the outskirts to the center, then over time amended to go around some buildings that were built in the way. Whereas roads in rural parts where I come from run in long straight lines and then suddenly swerve to get around a piece of land that a farmer wouldn't sell. But grids only exist in some parts of the few cities that were built mostly by colonial powers, or developed later with master planning. And even those grids usually split from their original orientation to becoming north-south at some point in in the city's development, leading to the interesting downtown triangle blocks of cities like Portland, San Francisco, Los Angeles, Seattle, New York. Other cities started to grid around their core footpath villages, like Madrid, Barcelona.The cities I find the most interesting (for roads) are the ones which kept gridding out in new directions to follow the course of a river. Cities like Buenos Aires, New Orleans, and Saigon, where the original paths followed curves around the river bends, resulting in multiple intersecting grids.The intersections and division boulevards between grids are, of course, the most beautiful and architecturally interesting parts of any city. They are where the blocks are strangely shaped and the buildings can't be rectangular, and usually where every inch of land is at a premium as well. It would be nice if a city-builder could simulate that aspect of urban growth: The shift from village center to grid, and old grid to new grid.",

But next offer the player an option to run a simulation of individual traffic movements, to discover serious issues, and let the player know about problems.To the OP, I suggest this simulation approach, not trying to discover flawless algorithms.

But rear tracks of a vehicle going slowly through sand will always be concentric.

Finally, superimposing highways and tunnels without destroying the original historical core. There were some beautiful results, but the traffic jams were astounding, even with limits on the city center roads and highway exits. This is the way cities actually grew, so to me it's much more interesting to simulate than a \"perfect\" city built all at once. One thing that was fun in SimCity 3000 was that certain technologies didn't become available until you had a certain population. I would almost wish that a city-builder now would allow you to take that to the extreme: Spend 200 years with horse-drawn carts before you can pave a road, and then figure out what to do with the mess.

Well now it's done. The compute run itself took 100s of AMD Turin cores, 100s of GBs of RAM, a few TBs of disk and 2 days of constant runtime on multiple machines.If you are interested in the technical details, Ryan and I have written extensively about the algorithm and pipeline that got us here:* Tom's blog post: https://tombh.co.uk/longest-line-of-sight* Ryan's technical breakdown: https://ryan.berge.rs/posts/total-viewshed-algorithmThis was a labor of love and we hope it inspires you both technically and naturally, to get you out seeing some of these vast views for yourselves!1. https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45485227",

          "content": "Hi Tom it's Marc, I'm glad to see you finished your sightline project ! Any clue why you report the longest sightline as \"530.8 km\" when it seems to be actually 538.1 km? That's what my code calculated (https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45512970) that's what Dr. Ulrich Deuschle also calculates (https://www.udeuschle.de/panoramas/panqueryfull.aspx?mode=ne...) You, Deuschle, and I all use the same DEM data (https://www.viewfinderpanoramas.org/Coverage%20map%20viewfin...) and the same refraction coeff (0.13), and nearly the same camera height (1.5m for me, 2.0m for Deuschle, and 1.65m for you—and these differing heights make no difference given the coarse DEM resolution). Something must be slighly off in your computations? Or do you think both Deuschle and I are wrong?Edit: to be clear the difference stems from our coordinates. Our starting points are:41.059167,77.683333 (me)41.0181,77.6708 (you)And our end points are:36.295364,78.755593 (me)36.314,78.7654 (you)Also I calculate the distance assuming the Earth is spherical (which gives 538 km) not the standard geodesic (which would give 537 km).And in the DEM data I measure the distance from the center of a cell to another (not the edge), while measuring from edge to edge may explain a difference of at most 0.1 km as the DEM resolution is 3 arcseconds.So clearly we disagree on the coordinates of the exact actual sightline as we have a 7 km difference :-)Edit #2: clearly the error is on your side. I should have checked this first, but the coordinates you give for the \"To\" point (41.0181,77.6708) land in a valley with the south view completely blocked so it's impossible to view 500+ km south as you claim.

We interpolate a \"band of sight\" of single a degree for our azithmual projection, but uniquely we also rotate the DEM elevations around all the observers rather than the observer around to see all the elevations.The effects of the first can be lessened by lowering the band of sight such that we only process half a degree at a time so that we make sure we get more coverage further away. We plan on running some more experiments by rotating to cover more points.The algorithm is already fairly expensive to run against the whole world so we weren't particularly interested in that level of coverage for the full earth.For total viewshed area, our algorithm comes in at roughly a percent or so difference which was what we used as our benchmark for correctness.All this to say, no, we don't think you both are wrong, we've been looking at making ours more accurate. At a world scale that's quite computationally expensive, so we didn't use that methodology for our initial launch.

EPA also helps produce melatonin which kick off sleep and this whole process.Natto-serrazime is probably an excellent complement as it is on the other side and is a dissolver.  (Noteworthy: Pterostilbene + Glucosamine similar to EPA reduces fibrosis)The interesting connection is how this is needed when we are older, but not younger.  When younger ERa activates more which does this all on its own.  This is the connection to why 2/3 of alzheimer's are post-menopausal women and why HRT is important.Edit: and to tie this to APOE as it is the gene most associated with Alzheimer's. e4/e4 requires more choline so someone with e4/e4 is more likely to be choline deficient.  EPA/DHA usually attach to Phosphatidylcholine (PC) when in the blood/brain.  PEMT is a gene controlled by ERa to make choline, but from the above less ERa activation and we make less PEMT so less choline and less PC.  Choline is the precursor to Acetylcholine (primary neurotransmitter for memory and focus and essential for REM sleep).  This is why Choline is known to help with Alzheimer's.",

Then the price has dropped to 3 times, and then it has diminished no more, remaining at 3 times for 5 years or more.I believe that it should be possible to further reduce the cost of \"algal\" oil to make it an acceptable substitute for fish oil, but it seems that the producers are content with their niche market of rich vegans and they do not make any effort to reduce the cost in order to enlarge their market.I have taken occasionally \"algal\" oil, to test it, but as long as it remains a luxury food I cannot use it to replace the cod liver oil that I am taking regularly, despite desiring to do so.",

      "abstract": "该讨论围绕如何将沃尔玛售价3.88美元的模拟时钟改造为基于ESP8266的Wi-Fi时钟展开。核心话题是DIY低成本网络授时时钟的技术方案与可行性。\n\n社区普遍赞赏该项目的创意，尤其关注其中采用“带EEPROM备份的SRAM”芯片以持久保存指针位置的设计。有用户指出，这种方案能避免传统EEPROM的写入寿命限制，且成本低廉。讨论中提到，许多用户长期寻求能通过NTP同步的电池供电Wi-Fi时钟，但市售产品较少。\n\n主要争议点集中在精度与实用性方面。有人认为改造后的时钟可能因电机驱动误差累积而产生漂移，最终与传统时钟无异；也有用户质疑为何不直接使用更廉价、功耗更低的电波钟。针对Wi-Fi授时的可能性，有用户提出接入点是否可作为时间信标供普通电器使用的疑问。\n\n在技术实现上，用户建议可通过霍尔传感器检测指针位置进行校准，或采用光耦晶体管保护微控制器免受电机反向电流冲击。部分用户还延伸讨论了类似改造在大型指针时钟或投影时钟上的应用潜力。",

It allows you to persistently save the clock hands' positions every time they're moved, without burning through the limited write endurance of a plain old EEPROM. And it costs less than $1 in single quantities. That's a useful product to know about.",

          "content": "This is cool but it seems like it would be liable to drift. I.e. it \"knows\" the correct time but doesn't have any way to figure out that it's been driving the movement fast or slow by some number of milliseconds. Eventually, that will pile up to the point that it's not any better than running the thing off of batteries.As the author points out, the cheap quartz mechanism has no way of reporting the position of the hands (other than the hands themselves) and that you have to set the PULSETIME constant by the right number of milliseconds. If you're off by even a millisecond, that's going to accumulate quick enough that it would make a  difference over even a single day, wouldn't it?EDIT: as some have pointed out, the Lavet stepper theoretically accounts for this in that it steps exactly one tick after so many oscillations. That number of oscillations does not change so that's all you need to get right.However, that basically just kicks the can down the road a bit in that if each step is not exactly 1/60th of a circle or bits wear down or get sticky or you have analog noise in there you will presumably still have a source of biased drift that you won't be able to detect. But maybe those affects are small enough that they don't matter for a wall clock.",

This saves on EEPROM write cycles:  If there are no power events, the EEPROM is never written at all.Meanwhile, the capacitor:  It provides the power for the chip to perform this EEPROM write when an \"oh shit!\" event occurs.When power comes back, the EEPROM's data is copied back to SRAM.---Downsides?

This contradicts the articles claim.No, it does not, it's just a confusion of the term reserves. That's not on you, though, because everyone constantly gets it wrong.Reserves are not estimates of the amount of a mineral underground. To be counted as proven reserve, you need to show that the mineral is economically extractable at market prices. Specifically, by starting to extract them. They are \"working inventory\" of mines that have been developed, they are not our understanding of how the minerals are distributed. They are also a function of commodity prices, not something that remains constant unless you dig them.China has so much of the worldwide production and reserves because mining is an extremely capital-intensive industry, that is also sensitive to labor costs and environmental legislation. For a long time, China had the trifecta of lax legislation, cheap labor, and sufficient political stability to attract investment. US or Europe can't compete because mining there is more expensive, the third world can't compete because people are wary of investing billions into projects that might go to zero for political stability reasons.Should the market prices of key minerals rise to the point where it makes sense to mine them outside of China, reserves will be developed and production will shift. This will probably require political will to either tariff Chinese production or subsidize production outside China, because so far China has wielded mineral exports as a weapon only for brief periods, being careful to release exports to crater prices often enough to kill competing projects.",

Whatever you're question, just ask and you'll be surprised at what you learn. For example asking for a cost/effort comparison of the metallurgic processes required for each type of rare earth host material really helped me understand what they were doing, and how each company differed in their approach.If you like learning random things on Hacker News, deep diving into any technology or industry will not be an issue.",

It is really a tough engineering problem to try to shave weight off of everything, because you are starting out with a 700kg battery replacing a 400kg engine + transmission, so you are ~300kg in the hole, and need to remove 300 kg from the rest of the car. That's why they do crazy stuff like use the battery as part of the structural frame, to save on metal there. Every extra kilogram reduces range. Solid things are made hollow. Metal is replaced by plastic. Fabrics are thinner or replaced with lighter-weight engineered materials. Lots of things are removed. Physical buttons gone, flourishes gone, handles gone. Seats are made thinner and with less material. See how they brag about a simpler new steering wheel that is 400g lighter?All of that and still they come up with a 2300 kg compact two row SUV.So, if you are going to be redesigning everything anyway to try to get rid of as much weight as possible, why not hire a designer known for sparse, minimalistic, clean design? It makes sense. It may not be what Ferrari buyers want, but you can't really blame Ferrari for giving it a try. We'll see how well it sells.",

This concept goes beyond simply using neural networks to model physical phenomena; instead, it posits that the universe's own learning process gives rise to physical laws (0:46).Key takeaways from the discussion include:\n• The Universe as a Neural Network (0:00-0:57): Vanchurin emphasizes that he is proposing this as a promising model for describing the universe, rather than a definitive statement of its ontological nature (2:48). The core idea is that the learning dynamics, which are typically used to optimize functions in machine learning, are the fundamental physics of the cosmos (6:20).\n• Deriving Fundamental Field Equations (21:17-22:01): The theory suggests that well-known physics equations, such as Einstein's field equations, Dirac, and Klein-Gordon equations, emerge from the learning process of this neural network universe.\n• Fermions and Particle Emergence (28:47-32:15): The conversation delves into how particles like fermions could emerge within this framework, with the idea that useful network configurations for learning survive, similar to natural selection.\n• Emergent Quantum Mechanics (44:53-49:31): The video explores how quantum behaviors, including the Schrödinger equation, could emerge from the two distinct dynamics within the system: activation and learning. This requires the system to have access to a \"bath\" or \"reservoir\" of neurons.\n• Natural Selection at the Subatomic Scale (1:05:10-1:07:34): Vanchurin suggests that natural selection operates on subatomic particles, where configurations that are more useful for minimizing the loss function (i.e., for efficient learning) survive and those that are not are removed.\n• Consciousness and Observers (1:15:40-1:24:09): The theory integrates the concept of observers into physics, proposing a three-way unification of quantum mechanics, general relativity, and observers. Consciousness is viewed as a measure of learning efficiency within a subsystem (1:30:38).",

It's only true if you insist on sticking with the original form of Weinberg's \"model of leptons\" from 1967 [1], which was written when massless neutrinos were consistent with available experimental data. Adding quark-style (i.e. Dirac) neutrino mass terms to the Standard Model is a trivial exercise. If doing so offends some prejudice of yours that right-handed neutrino can not exist because they have no electric and weak charge (in which case you must really hate photons too, not to mention gravity) you can resort to a Majorana mass term [2] instead.That question (are neutrinos Dirac or Majorana?) is not a \"contradiction\", it's an uncertainty caused by how difficult it is to experimentally rule out either option. It is most certainly not \"a problem for the standard model\".[1] https://journals.aps.org/prl/pdf/10.1103/PhysRevLett.19.1264[2] https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Majorana_equation#Mass_term",

It felt depressing.It seems like one of those places that is probably quite nice if you're loaded, but it seems like a pretty rough place if you're not already well off. I was also surprised that many of the stereotypes about 'one fine city' were not quite on the mark. Jaywalking, crossing against a cross-walk light, and various other little infractions were ever-present which left me feeling a bit odd as when in Rome do what the Romans do, but yeah... not gonna risk that.",

Well they vote so yes? Is there any chance at all of peaceful regime change through voting? Technically yes, in practice? Probably not. I would expect extreme suppression and HK style riot crushing. They have been doing it quietly for decades, targeting and legally destroying/bankrupting any opposition to the PAP.So the only real difference vs say China is that while both are authoritarian regimes the Chinese didn't bother with a mechanism to pretend you can throw them out.To be clear, I don't object to their form of government.

V8 or SpiderMonkey would be a nightmare to get running pre-boot.What I find most interesting is the UEFI services binding approach. Rather than trying to abstract away the hardware, it exposes the raw EFI protocols (GraphicsOutput, SimpleFileSystem, etc.) directly to JS. That's a much more pragmatic design than trying to build a full HAL — you get to prototype UEFI applications rapidly while keeping the escape hatch to C for anything performance-critical.Would love to see if anyone tries hooking this into UEFI's built-in network stack for PXE boot scripting. That could actually be useful beyond the novelty factor.",

So if you had unlimited grenades (or I guess just a lot of them without cheating), you could fly from one skyscraper to where ever else as long as you kept throwing those grenades. Just needed to remember to be on something as high when you stop throwing, or you’d still splat :D",

My parents were pretty against me playing any kind of “violent” video games. So secretly playing GTA 2 on the GBC was kind of exciting due to that as well. Even though the “violence” in GTA 2 on GBC is of course very tame in terms of any kind of graphic realism or anything.A few years later one of my friends was playing GTA III on the PS2 at his home. I also had a PS2, but there was no chance of my parents letting me play that, and I didn’t even play it at his house either.Later still, Rockstar was giving away GTA 2 for PC for free on their website. So I played GTA 2 a little bit on PC too, after GTA III (and probably Vice City) was already out.It took many years before I finally had a chance to play GTA III, GTA Vice City and GTA San Andreas. My first time playing GTA III and GTA Vice City was when I was an adult with an iPhone and they sold iOS ports of those games in the App Store. I ended up completing GTA III and GTA Vice City on the iPhone and have played a bit of GTA San Andreas on the iPhone as well, including completing the famous train mission.",

Databases don’t type check and aren’t compatible with your functional code written on servers.The first one is stupid… almost everyone just makes this mistake and most of the time unless you were there in the beginning to enforce monorepo you have to live with someone deploying a breaking change that effects a repo somehwere else. I’ve been in places where they simply didn’t understand the hole with polyrepos and they went with it despite me diagramming the issue on a white board (it’s that pervasive). Polyrepos exist for people who like organizing things with names and don’t understand static safety.And it gets worse. So many people don’t understand that this problem only gets worse over time. The more repos you have in your polyrepo the more brittle everything becomes and they don’t even understand why.The second one is also stupid but you had to be there in the very very beginning to have stopped it. The inception of the concept of databases should have been created such that any query you run on it needs to be compiled to run on the database and is thus statically checked. This is something that can easily be done but wasn’t done and now the entire World Wide Web just has to make do with testing. Hello? Type checking in application code but not in query code? Why?That’s like half the problems with distributed systems completely solved. And these problems just exist because of raw stupidity. Stuff like race conditions and dead locks are solvable too but much harder. But these issues are obvious. What’s not obvious are the aforementioned problems that almost nobody talks about even though they are completely solvable.",

This makes those tools, as powerful as they can be, unable to help us think about and enforce correctness across horizons that are not visible from the standpoint of a single project at a single point in time (systems distributed across time, across network, across version history).I feel like the issue of semantic drift is a bigger topic that probably has roots beyond systems architecture/computer engineering.Also I found the writing style very clear.

I helped build a system very similar to the one quoted below:> A deploy pipeline that queries your orchestrator for running image tags, checks your migration history against the schema registry, diffs your GraphQL schema against collected client operations, and runs Buf’s compatibility checks: this is buildable today, with off-the-shelf parts.that was largely successful at eliminating interservice compatibility errors, but it felt like we were scrambling around in a dark and dusty corner of software engineering that not many people really cared about. Good to see that there's a body of academic work that I was not entirely aware about that is looking into this.The article successfully identifies that, yes, there are ways, with sufficient effort, to statically verify that a schema change is (mostly) safe or unsafe before deployment. But even with that determination, a lot of IDLs make it still very hard to evolve types! The compatibility checker will successfully identify that strengthening a type from `optional` to `required` isn't backwards compatible: _now what_. There isn't a safe pathway for schema evolution, and you need to reach for something like Cambria (https://www.inkandswitch.com/cambria/, cited in the article) to handle the evolution.I've only seen one IDL try to do this properly by baking evolution semantics directly into its type model, typical (https://github.com/stepchowfun/typical) with it's `asymmetric` type label: it makes a field required in the constructor but not the deserialiser. I would like to see these \"asymmetric\" types find their ways into IDLs like Protocol Buffers such that their compatibility checkers, like Buf's `buf breaking` (https://buf.build/docs/reference/cli/buf/breaking/), can formally reason about them. I feel like there is a rich design space of asymmetric types that are poorly described  (enum values that can only be compared against but never constructed, paired validations, fallback values sent over the wire, etc.)Another one that I think makes a pretty good attempt is the config language CUE and its type system (https://cuelang.org/docs/concept/the-logic-of-cue/), which allows you to do first-class version compatibility modelling. But I have yet to investigate whether CUE is fit for purpose for modelling compatibility over the wire / between service deploys.",

It was based on a spec for a different product, so it contained a lot of institutional knowledge of how lawful intercept works.A key element of the design of lawful intercept is not to trust the company running the network. Otherwise employees of that company would become targets for organized crime influence, among what are probably a few other considerations. The network operator isn't told about intercepts, and the relatively low rate of traffic intercept, the node has to support up to 3% of traffic intercepted, at least that was the spec at the time, makes it relatively easy for that traffic to be hidden from network management tools. It's not supposed to show up in your logs or network management reporting.Intercepts originate on LI consoles operated by law enforcement agencies. This sounds pretty good so far. Until a hacker breaks into an LI console. Now that hacker can acquire traffic with pinpoint accuracy, undetected by design.I have always been skeptical of claims that network operators have eliminated salt typhoon from their networks. I do not believe they know when the exploit began. Nor can they tell if their networks are truly free of salt typhoon activity. There are multiple vendors of LI console software. It's a standardized interoperable protocol to set up intercepts. So there's no one neck to wring.",

Especially in deferred rendering pipelines the rasterizer creates a bunch of buffers for depth map, normal map, color, etc but main shaders are running on those 2d buffers. That's the beauty of it parts operating with 3d triangles are kept simple simple and the expensive lighting shaders run once on flat 2d images with 0 overdraw. The shaders don't care whether normal map buffer came from 3d geometry which was rasterized just now, prerendered some time ago or the mix of 2. And even in forward rendering pipelines the  fragment shader is operating on implicit 2d pixels created by vertex shaders and rasterizer from \"real 3d\" data.The way I look at it if the input and math in the shader is working with 3d vectors its a 3d shader. Whether there is also a 3d rasterizer is a separate question.Modern 3d games are exploiting it in many different ways.

If you study game theory even a little one of the big lessons is that cooperation at scale is incredibly hard, and that most highly cooperative states are highly unstable. A small number of defectors can easily collapse the whole system back to a more stable tit-for-tat or all-defect state. All-defect states, meanwhile, are often stable.This probably explains why it took billions of years to get multicellular complex life. It took billions of years for evolution to figure out how to make something that doesn't instantly defect.It's related to the second law of thermodynamics. An all cooperate state is highly ordered, and thus higher energy and prone to collapsing into a lower energy less ordered state.A living system that wants to be all-cooperate is going to have to expend huge amounts of energy to maintain that state, which leads me to the final problem with anarchism: most anarchists I've read or met are at least to some degree anti-growth / anti-industry / primitivist types. That math doesn't math. If you want a society where everyone cooperates and is taken care of, that society is going to have huge energy needs, much larger than totalitarian-slum or crime-ridden-hellhole.I mean, poor people use less energy for starters. Dead people use even less.The last part is why all the most socially realistic depictions of societies like this are post-scarcity where they've mastered some kind of sci-fi energy source (cheap easy fusion, antimatter, tapping the zero point, etc.). They can create an all-cooperate utopia by using embarrassing amounts of energy to not just police and stamp out defection but render it unnecessary to begin with.",

Marx realized that socialism could only be build upon the massive development of productivity forces that would lead towards a post scarcity society.Which is also why actually existing socialism struggled so hard. A revolution is more likely to occur in the least developed parts of the world but that also means it will be one of the hardest places to implement socialism in. Especially while having to defend itself against the rest of the world.Many Marxists didn't even believe it could be possible to build socialism in such a condition but the Soviet Union proved otherwise. It brought many millions of people out of poverty but also had to make some hard and maybe sometimes wrong choices.The good news is that these days even the least developed parts of the world are vastly more developed than they were in the 19th or 20th century. Modern actually existing socialism will look vastly different. Plus the rot of the latest stage of capitalism is showing more and more.So socialism might be closer than we might think.",

The likelihood of defection is minimised by firstly the values passed onto younger generations in their education system, and secondly the lack of actual benefit (since few people would follow you and there's not much material wealth or power to gain).

          "content": "Static inline functions can sometimes serve as an optimisation barrier to compilers. Its very annoying. I've run into a lot of cases when targeting C as a compilation target where swapping something out into an always-inline function results in worse code generation, because compilers have bugs sadlyThere's also the issue in that the following two things don't have the same semantics in C:    float v = a * b + c;\n\nvs    static_inline float get_thing(float a, float b) {\n        return a*b;\n    }\n\n    float v = get_thing(a, b) + c;\n\nThis is just a C-ism (floating point contraction) that can make extracting things into always inlined functions still be a big net performance negative. The C spec mandates it sadly!uintptr_t's don't actually have the same semantics as pointers either. Eg if you write:    void my_func(strong_type1* a, strong_type2* b);\n\na =/= b, and we can pull the underlying type out. However, if you write:    void my_func(some_type_that_has_a_uintptr_t1 ap, some_type_that_has_a_uintptr_t2 bp) {\n        float* a = get(ap);\n        float* b = get(bp);\n    }\n\na could equal b. Semantically the uintptr_t version doesn't provide any aliasing semantics. Which may or may not be what you want depending on your higher level language semantics, but its worth keeping the distinction in mind because the compiler won't be able to optimise as well",

C作为后端语言真正的痛点在于垃圾回收。最优的GC方案需要与常规栈帧深度结合，使得普通栈遍历程序能同时提供精确GC所需数据（这是所有移动式GC设计的基础，即使更简单的分代收集器可以不依赖此功能）。若想实现既精确又快速的可移植栈扫描，当前最合理的方法是维护影子栈：在调用时传递前帧指针，该指针指向扁平数组末端，数组头部包含标识指针和前序帧指针（形成链式结构..."

Then the type inference engine was expanded to also specialise functions based on ownership/borrowing type of its arguments.

You type commands, results is displayed in your terminal or in less. There’s no \"keyboard shortcuts\" or \"environment\".

In other words, the human user sees everything as generic \"posts\" an approach not unlike many Nostr clients, to name something modern. It's the paradigm of saying \"in the end, what matters is the message\". As long as there's a readable amount of them, you don't need anything else; when they reach a certain volume, well, you need to be able to \"filter\" them somehow so that some are never seen/read, for others you only see the title at a glance, and some are actually read. This is the principle of scoring, which is even older, I think it was part of the first PARC Altos.What I meant is that I wonder how long it will take nowadays to go back to creating a decentralized model or, since overhead allows for it today, a distributed one, that serves modern forms of human communication:- blogs (e.g. Nostr's long-form notes in Habla, or WireFreely for the Fediverse)- non-synchronous short messages (e.g. Twitter/X style)- synchronous short messages, i.e. chatWith a decentralized/distributed network for distribution where everyone keeps what they want on their own hardware.On the sidelines, it would be nice today to also see synchronous audio and audio+video, meaning calls and conferences, all in a single UI and with at most two or three protocols on the network side (one for asynchronous messages and media, one for chat if the asynchronous one doesn't cut it, and one for calls).Without the end user having to make personal collages if they don't want to, using an app that is go-installable, pip-able, cargo-build-able, basically something that both those who want to try it and distro packagers can add quickly. This would help spread something among techies/nerds/geeks and also works for the end user, who would be introduced to this solution by the techies/nerds/geeks. To me, this is what's missing to see the big platforms currently in fashion get toppled.Seeing projects like Offpunk inspired the thoughts above; that was the point :)",

The only user input is a small search query. It's intentionally set up against building any kind of BBS/Forum. So you need a different way to write and upload, which - in my opinion - kills the whole project. YMMV.Lagrange - the most used browser - used to have something called \"Titan\" as user upload but that was never specified and nobody used it and I think it's removed from Lagrange now.edit: ah it still supports it (Titan). It just seems there is no server in the world that uses it.",

I don't see the need for social media through Gemini when there are loads of other protocols we can use for that.
