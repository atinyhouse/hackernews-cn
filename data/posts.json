      "abstract": "该讨论围绕电视图像设置展开，核心话题是电视制造商默认的“画面增强”功能（如动态插帧、鲜艳模式）是否破坏了创作者的原始意图。多数用户认同这些设置常导致不自然的“肥皂剧效应”或色彩失真，支持关闭不必要的图像处理以还原影视作品的本来面貌。\n\n讨论中提到，用户普遍批评电视厂商的设置命名模糊、功能说明不清，导致普通消费者难以正确配置。有人认为应优先使用“电影制作人模式”等专业预设，也有用户指出不同品牌差异显著，如LG的调校选项优于三星。分歧点在于对高帧率与动态插帧的态度：部分用户厌恶任何插帧效果，坚持传统24帧的观影体验；也有用户指出高帧率能减少画面抖动，偏好平滑的运动表现。\n\n此外，有用户抱怨电视智能功能（如自动切换模式）带来干扰，希望获得更简洁的显示设备。整体上，社区共识是电视图像设置应更透明化，并尊重创作者的视觉设计。",

          "content": "It would help if TV manufacturers would clearly document what these features do, and use consistent names that reflect that.It seems they want to make these settings usable without specialist knowledge, but the end result of their opaque naming and vague descriptions is that anybody who actually cares about what they see and thinks they might benefit from some of the features has to either systematically try every possible combination of options or teach themselves video engineering and try to figure out for themselves what each one actually does.This isn't unique to TVs. It's amazing really how much effort a company will put into adding a feature to a product only to completely negate any value it might have by assuming any attempt at clearly documenting it, even if buried deep in a manual, will cause their customers' brains to explode.",

Brands and models are displayed side-by-side.  The only way to stand out is to push the limits of over-enhancement along every possible axis (resolution, color, motion, etc.).Since consumers are not trained to critically discern image and video quality, the \"Wow!\" often wins the sale.  This easily explains the existence of local dimming solutions (now called miniLED or some other thing).  In a super bright Best Buy or Walmart viewing environment they can look fantastic (although, if you know what to look for you can see the issues).  When you get that same TV home and watch a movie in the dark...oh man, the halos jump off the screen.  Now they are starting to push \"RGB miniLED\" as if that is going to fix basic optics/physics issues.And don't get me started on horrible implementations of HDR.This is clearly a case of the average consumer not knowing enough (they should not have to be experts, BTW) and effectively getting duped by marketing.",

If every manufacturer does just that, then their screens will all look extremely similar.If your TV looks like everybody else's, how do you get people strolling through an electronics store to say, \"Wow!

Music tends to come out of multiple speakers, and so do a lot of explosions and sound effects.Most people don't have multi-channel setups at home. So you get everything coming out of 2 speakers or a sound bar.What that means, is that you get 4+ channels of music and sound effects mixed into 2 channels. So it ends up drowning out the single voice channel.When I play movies through Kodi, I generally go into the audio settings and turn up the center channel. This fixes the issue every time for me.",

Most native speakers seem to be convinced that vowels are the most important part of English, but I think it isn't true.  Sure, English has a huge number of vowels, but they are almost completely redundant. It's hard to find cases where vowels really matter for comprehension, which is why they may vary so much across accents without impeding communication. So what the actors do is that they focus on the vowels, but slur the consonants, and you are pretty much completely lost without the consonants.",

Like watching fast flowing end credits but instead of following the text, keeping the eyes fixed at some point.> Films are more like dreams than like real life. That frame rate is essential to them, and its choice, driven by technical constraints of the time when films added sound, was one of happiest accidents in the history of Arts.I wonder though, had the industry started with 60 fps, would people now applaud the 24/30 fps as a nice dream-like effect everyone should incorporate into movies and series alike?",

OpenAI, Anthropic, Google, Meta, Deepseek, etc. There's no evidence of a technological moat or a competitive advantage in any of these companies.The conclusion? AI is a world-changing technology, just like the railroads were, and it is going to soon explode in a huge bubble - just like the railroads did.

          "content": "Something nobody's talking about: OpenAI's losses might actually be attractive to certain investors from a tax perspective.\nMicrosoft and other corporate investors can potentially use their share of OpenAI's operating losses to offset their own taxable income through partnership tax treatment. It's basically a tax-advantaged way to fund R&D - you get the loss deductions now while retaining upside optionality later. This is why the \"cash burn = value destruction\" framing misses the mark. For the right investor base, $10B in annual losses at OpenAI could be worth $2-3B in tax shields (depending on their bracket and how the structure works). That completely changes the return calculation.\nThe real question isn't \"can OpenAI justify its valuation\" but rather \"what's the blended tax rate of its investor base?\" If you're sitting on a pile of profitable cloud revenue like Microsoft, suddenly OpenAI's burn rate starts looking like a pretty efficient way to minimize your tax bill while getting a free option on the AI leader. This also explains why big tech is so eager to invest at nosebleed valuations. They're not just betting on AI upside, they're getting immediate tax benefits that de-risk the whole thing.",

          "content": "I don't see a bubble, I see a rapidly growing business case.MS Office has about 345 million active users. Those are paying subscriptions. IMHO that's roughly the totally addressable market for OpenAI for non coding users. Coding users is another few 20-30 million.If OpenAI can convert double digit percentages of those onto 20$ and 50$ per month subscriptions by delivering good enough AI that works well, they should be raking in cash by the billions per month adding up to close to the projected 2030 cash burn per year. That would be just subscription revenue. There is also going to be API revenue. And those expensive models used for video and other media creation are going to be indispensable for media and advertising companies which is yet more revenue.The office market at 20$/month is worth about 82 billion per year in subscription revenue. Add maybe a few premium tiers to that at 50$/month and 100$/month and that 2030 130 billion per year in cash burn suddenly seems quite reasonable.I've been quite impressed with Codex in the last few months. I only pay 20$/month for that currently. If that goes up, I won't loose sleep over it as it is valuable enough to me. Most programmers I know are on some paid subscription to that, Anthropic's Claude, or similar. Quite a few spend quite a bit more than that. My Chat GPT Plus subscription feels like really good value to me currently.Agentic tooling for business users is currently severely lacking in capability. Most of the tools are crap. You can get models to generate text. But forget about getting them to format that text correctly in a word processor. I'm constantly fixing bullets, headings and what not in Google docs for my AI assisted writings. Gemini is close to ff-ing useless both with the text and the formatting.But I've seen enough technology demos of what is possible to know that this is mostly a UX and software development problem, not a model quality problem. It seems companies are holding back from fully integrating things mainly for liability reasons (I suspect). But unlocking AI value like that is where the money is. Something similarly useful as codex for business usage with full access to your mail, drive, spread sheets, slides, word processors, CRMs, and whatever other tools you use running in YOLO mode (which is how I use codex in a virtual machine currently, --yolo). That would replace a shit ton of manual drudgery for me. It would be valuable to me and lots of other users. Valuable as in \"please take my money\".Currently doing stuff like this is a very scary thing to do because it might make expensive/embarrassing mistakes. I do it for code because I can contain the risk to the vm. It actually seems to be pretty well behaved. The vm is just there to make me feel good. It could do all sorts of crazy shit. It mostly just does what I ask it to. Clearly the security model around this needs work and instrumentation. That's not a model training problem though.Something like this for business usage is going to be the next step in agent powered utility that people will pay for at MS office levels of numbers of users and revenue. Google and MS could do it technically but they have huge legal exposure via their existing SAAS contracts and they seem scared shitless of their own lawyers. OpenAI doing something aggressive in this space in the next year or so is what I'm expecting to happen.Anyway, the bubble predictors seem to be ignoring the revenue potential here. Could it go wrong for OpenAI? Sure. If somebody else shows up and takes most of the revenue. But I think we're past the point where that revenue is not looking very realistic. Five years is a long time for them to get to 130 billion per year in revenue. Chat GPT did not exist five years ago. OpenAI can mess this up by letting somebody else take most of that revenue. The question is who? Google, maybe but I'm underwhelmed so far. MS, seems to want to but unable to. Apple is flailing. Anthropic seems increasingly like an also ran.There is a hardware cost bubble though. I'm betting OpenAI will get a lot more bang for its buck in terms of hardware by 2030. It won't be NVidia taking most of that revenue. They'll have competition and enter a race to the bottom in terms of hardware cost. If OpenAI burning 130 billion per year, it will probably be getting a lot more compute for it than currently projected. IMHO that's a reasonable cost level given the total addressable market for them. They should be raking in hundreds of billions by then.",

In terms of competition, I don't think we've seen any groundbreaking new research or architecture since the introduction of inference time compute (\"thinking\") in late 2024/early 2025 circa GPT-o4.The majority of the cost/innovation now is training this 1-2 year old technology on increasingly large amounts of content, and developing more hardware capable of running these larger models at more scale. I think it's fair to say the majority of capital is now being dumped into hardware, whether that's HBM and research related to that, or increasingly powerful GPUs and TPUs.But these components are applicable to a lot of other places other than AI, and I think we'll probably stumble across some manufacturing techniques or physics discoveries that will have a positive impact on other industries.> that ends up in a race to the bottom competing on cost and efficiency of deliveringOne could say that the introduction of the personal computer became a \"race to the bottom.\" But it was only the start of the dot-com bubble era, a bubble that brought about a lot of beneficial market expansion.> models that have all reached the same asymptotic performance in the sense of intelligence, reasoning, etc.I definitely agree with the asymptotic performance. But I think the more exciting fact is that we can probably expect LLMs to get a LOT cheaper in the next few years as the current investments in hardware begin to pay off, and I think it's safe to assume that in 5-10 years, most entry-level laptops will be able to manage a local 30B sized model while still being capable of multitasking. As it gets cheaper, more applications for it become more practical.---Regarding OpenAI, I think it definitely stands in a somewhat precarious spot, since basically the majority of its valuation is justified by nothing less than expectations of future profit. Unlike Google, which was profitable before the introduction of Gemini, AI startups need to establish profitability still. I think although initial expectations were for B2C models for these AI companies, most of the ones that survive will do so by pivoting to a B2B structure. I think it's fair to say that most businesses are more inclined to spend money chasing AI than individuals, and that'll lead to an increase in AI consulting type firms.",

A theoretical Windows PE binary that was 100% statically linked (and so directly contained NT syscalls) wouldn’t be at-all portable between different Windows versions.Linux with glibc is the complete opposite; there really does exist old Linux software that static-links in everything down to libc, just interacting with the kernel through syscalls—and it does (almost always) still work to run such software on a modern Linux, even when the software is 10-20 years old.I guess this is why Linux containers are such a thing: you’re taking a dynamically-linked Linux binary and pinning it to a particular entire userland, such that when you run the old software, it calls into the old glibc. Containers work, because they ultimately ground out in the same set of stable kernel ABI calls.(Which, now that I think of it, makes me wonder how exactly Windows containers work. I’m guessing each one brings its own NTOSKRNL, that gets spun up under HyperV if the host kernel ABI doesn’t match the guest?)",

          "content": "> and why all modern native UI frameworks have a similar model these days.Personally I much rather the approach taken by solidjs / svelte.React’s approach is very inefficient - the entire view tree is rerendered when any change happens. Then they need to diff the new UI state with the old state and do reconciliation. This works well enough for tiny examples, but it’s clunky at scale. And the code to do diffing and reconciliation is insanely complicated. Hello world in react is like 200kb of javascript or something like that. (Smaller gzipped, but the browser still needs to parse it all at startup). And all of that diffing is also pure overhead. It’s simply not needed.The solidjs / react model uses the compiler to figure out how variables changing results in changes to the rendered view tree. Those variables are wrapped up as “observed state”. As a result, you can just update those variables and exactly and only the parts of the UI that need to be changed will be redrawn. No overrendering. No diffing. No virtual Dom and no reconciliation. Hello world in solid or svelte is minuscule - 2kb or something.Unfortunately, swiftui has copied react. And not the superior approach of newer libraries.The rust “Leptos” library implements this same fine grained reactivity, but it’s still married to the web. I’m really hoping someone takes the same idea and ports it to desktop / native UI.",

Devs hate middlemen who silently fuck up their software and leave upstream with the mess, users hate being restricted to whatever software was cool and current two years ago. If they use a rolling distro, they hate the constant brokenness that comes with it. Of the 1% of people who don't hate this situation 99% of those merely tolerate it, and the rest are Debian developers who are blinded by ideology and sunk costs.Good operating systems should:1. Allow users to obtain software from anywhere.2. Execute all programs that were written for previous versions reliably.3. Not insert themselves as middlemen into user/developer transactions.Judged from this perspective, Windows is a good OS. It doesn't nail all three all the time, but it gets the closest. Linux is a bad OS.The answers to your questions are:(1) It isn't backwards compatible for sophisticated GUI apps. Core APIs like the widget toolkits change their API all the time (GTK 1->2->3->4, Qt also does this). It's also not forwards compatible. Compiling the same program on a new release may yield binaries that don't run on an old release. Linux library authors don't consider this a problem, Microsoft/Apple/everyone else does. This is the origin of the glibc symbol versioning errors everyone experiences sometimes.(2) Maintaining a stable API/ABI is not fun and requires a capitalist who says \"keep app X working or else I'll fire you\". The capitalist Fights For The User. Linux is a socialist/collectivist project with nobody playing this role. Distros like Red Hat clone the software ecosystem into a private space that's semi-capitalist again, and do offer stable ABIs, but their releases are just ecosystem forks and the wider issue remains.(3) It hasn't change and it's still bad.(4) Docker: \"solves\" the problem on servers by shipping the entire userspace with every app, and being itself developed by a for-profit company. Only works because servers don't need any shared services from the computer beyond opening sockets and reading/writing files, so the kernel is good enough and the kernel does maintain a stable ABI. Docker obviously doesn't help the moment you move outside the server space and coordination requirements are larger.",

The human eye is most sensitive to green light, so that channel effectively carries the majority of the luminance (brightness/detail) data.\nIn many advanced demosaicing algorithms, the pipeline actually reconstructs the green channel first to get a high-resolution luminance map, and then interpolates the red/blue signals—which act more like \"color difference\" layers—on top of it. We can get away with this because the human visual system is much more forgiving of low-resolution color data than it is of low-resolution brightness data. It’s the same psycho-visual principle that justifies 4:2:0 chroma subsampling in video compression.Also, for anyone interested in how deep the rabbit hole goes, looking at the source code for dcraw (or libraw) is a rite of passage.

In that case I think there’s a well defined concept of “unprocessed” as it is a physical object.For digital photo, you require at least a rescaling to turn it to grayscale as the author did. But even that, the values your monitor shows already is not linear. And I’m not sure pedagogically it should be started with that, as the authors mention later about the Bayer pattern. Shouldn’t “unprocessed” come with the color information? Because if you start from gray scale, the color information seems to be added from the processing itself (ie you’re not gradually adding only processing to your “unprocessed” photo).To be fair, representing “unprocessed” Bayer pattern is much harder as the color filter does not nicely maps to RGB.

But that was uniform \"noise\" all over the picture.  Nowadays, noise reduction is impressive, but at the cost of sometimes changing the picture.  For example, the IP cameras I have, sometimes when I come home on the bike, part of the wheel is missing, having been deleted by the algorithm as it struggled with the \"grainy\" asphalt driveway underneath.Smartphone and dedicated digital still cameras aren't as drastic, but when zoomed in, or in low light, faces have a \"painted\" kind of look.

If you plan on getting down and dirty with colors and really grading, you generally shoot flat). The image that we handover to DIT/editing can be borderline grayscale in its appearance. The colors are so muted, the dynamic range is so wide, that you basically have a highly muted image. The reason for this is you then have the freedom to “push” the color and look and almost any direction, versus if you have a very saturated, high contrast image, you are more “locked” into that look. This matters more and more when you are using a compressed codec and not something with an incredibly high bitrate or raw codecs, which is a whole other world and I am also doing a bit of a disservice to by oversimplifying.Though this being HN it is incredibly likely I am telling few to no people anything new here lol",

Everything is an interpretation of the data that the camera has to do, making a thousand choices along the way, as this post beautifully demonstrates.A better discriminator might be global edits vs local edits, with local edits being things like retouching specific parts of the image to make desired changes, and one could argue that local edits are \"more fake\" than global edits, but it still depends on a thousand factors, most importantly intent.\"Fake\" images are images with intent to deceive. By that definition, even an image that came straight out of the camera can be \"fake\" if it's showing something other than what it's purported to (e.g. a real photo of police violence but with a label saying it's in a different country is a fake photo).What most people think when they say \"fake\", though, is a photo that has had filters applied, which makes zero sense. As the post shows, all photos have filters applied. We should get over that specific editing process, it's no more fake than anything else.",

Since you have a photography background you'll understand the tradeoff that you'd have to make if you could only choose one lens and f-stop combination but you needed everything in every scene to be in focus.You can get low-light IP cameras or manual focus cameras that do better.The second factor is the video compression ratio. The more noise you let through, the higher bitrate needed to stream and archive the footage. Let too much noise through for a bitrate setting and the video codec will be ditching the noise for you, or you'll be swimming in macroblocks. There are IP cameras that let you turn up the bitrate and decrease the denoise setting like you want, but be prepared to watch your video storage times decrease dramatically as most of your bits go to storing that noise.> Smartphone and dedicated digital still cameras aren't as drastic, but when zoomed in, or in low light, faces have a \"painted\" kind of look. I'd prefer honest noise, or better yet an adjustable denoising algorithm from \"none\" (grainy but honest) to what is now the default.If you have an iPhone then getting a camera app like Halide and shooting in one of the RAW formats will let you do this and more.

So when editing a photo, you may apply some processing to different areas to nudge the colors closer to how you’d “see” them.Ditto for black and white photos.  Your visual perception has pretty high dynamic range.  Not least because your eyes move and your brain creates a representation that gives you the illusion of higher dynamic range than what your eyes can actually deliver.

          "content": "> does applying the same transfer function to each pixel (of a given colour anyway) count as “processing”?This is interesting to think about, at least for us photo nerds. ;) I honestly think there are multiple right answers, but I have a specific one that I prefer. Applying the same transfer function to all pixels corresponds pretty tightly to film & paper exposure in analog photography. So one reasonable followup question is: did we count manually over- or under-exposing an analog photo to be manipulation or “processing”? Like you can’t see an image without exposing it, so even though there are timing & brightness recommendations for any given film or paper, generally speaking it’s not considered manipulation to expose it until it’s visible. Sometimes if we pushed or pulled to change the way something looks such that you see things that weren’t visible to the naked eye, then we call it manipulation, but generally people aren’t accused of “photoshopping” something just by raising or lowering the brightness a little, right?When I started reading the article, my first thought was, ‘there’s no such thing as an unprocessed photo that you can see’. Sensor readings can’t be looked at without making choices about how to expose them, without choosing a mapping or transfer function. That’s not to mention that they come with physical response curves that the author went out of his way to sort-of remove. The first few dark images in there are a sort of unnatural way to view images, but in fact they are just as processed as the final image, they’re simply processed differently. You can’t avoid “processing” a digital image if you want to see it, right? Measuring light with sensors involves response curves, transcoding to an image format involves response curves, and displaying on monitor or paper involves response curves, so any image has been processed a bunch by the time we see it, right? Does that count as “processing”? Technically, I think exposure processing is always built-in, but that kinda means exposing an image is natural and not some type of manipulation that changes the image. Ultimately it depends on what we mean by “processing”.",

My understanding is that gamma correction is effectively a optimization scheme during encoding to allocate bits in a perceptually uniform way across the dynamic range. But if you just have enough bits to work with and are not concerned with file sizes (and assuming all hardware could support these higher bit depths), then this shouldn't matter? IIRC unlike crts, LCDs don't have a power curve response in terms of the hardware anyway, and emulate the overall 2.2 trc via LUT. So you could certainly get monitors to accept linear input (assuming you manage to crank up the bit depth enough to the point where you're not losing perceptual fidelity), and just do everything in linear light.In fact if you just encoded the linear values as floats that would probably give you best of both worlds, since floating point is basically log-encoding where density of floats is lower at the higher end of the range.https://www.scantips.com/lights/gamma2.html (I don't agree with a lot of the claims there, but it has a nice calculator)",

Through a series of chemical reactions, you develop those specks.  Differences in chemistry, in temperatures, in agitation, in the film, all affect what for digital images is described as processing.  Then in printing, you have a similar process all over again.If anything, one might argue that the digital process allows a more consistent and quantitative understanding of the actual processing being done.

One of the reasons I think this might still work is that captured carbon can be used to create platform chemicals (various hydrocarbons) using the fischer tropsch process. Electrofuels are using direct air capture to generate fossil replacements.Only requirement is energy and there too it isn't all that expensive to pull air in from the atmosphere or to seperate CO2 from adsorbent via low grade heat (70-100c)So far into the future this method could allow us to continue produce critical hydrocarbon materials (used everywhere from plastics to pharamaceuticals) without having to depend upon concentrated and contested oil supplies.More than energy efficiency its volumetric efficiency that's the issue. At the moment (to the best of my knowledge) kg of capturing materials capture tens of grams of CO2. Pulling it from air is not that energy intensive but finding materials that can actually filter out CO2 from that air is difficult. If breakthroughs are made in this area it will have industrial applications. Then it won't be just sequestering.Of course the easier solution is to plant more trees and grasses but they grow very slowly and require valuable land. Still this approach is feasible in some uncultivable lands. Crops like cottongrass[1] can grow even in tundra climate and can be valuable source of both technically imp carbon via cellulose and a means to capture CO2. We don't have to make a choice. We can do both simultaneously.[1] https://www.fs.usda.gov/database/feis/plants/graminoid/eriva...",

That means you can calculate the volume of material required so sink a desired amount of atmospheric carbon.If you want to have a measurable impact on the atmosphere, say dialing it back to 1980 CO2 levels, you're talking not about making a pile of stuff but about making a mountain range that's a mile high and hundreds of miles long.Now figure out how many trucks you're going to need to move that much material from where your sequestering machine is to where your pile of stuff is.Or if you want to dump that material in the ocean (which someone else will certainly object to), extend your calculation to figure out how many container trucks worth of material you need to dump into the ocean every hour to accomplish your atmospheric cleanup in whatever amount of time you choose (a decade? If it takes a century, that's not fast enough).And finally think about surface to volume ratios. You're trying to sink it into a volume, but you can only get the gas into the volume through its surface, so the speed of your process is limited by surface area.If you want to do it with trees,\nmy personal spitball estimates are that you probably need to plant somewhere between the entire state of Connecticut and the entire state of Colorado to have the kind of impact one would want (there's more subtlety to tree calculations than one generally likes to admit, so feel free to come in with way higher numbers than I did).Which brings us back to economics. If you have a well-managed forest of that size and scale, someone is eventually going to come along, maybe in 100 years, maybe in 500 years, and say \"hey if we cut this down, we could burn the wood to heat our homes\" and all that carbon goes back into the atmosphere, so you actually need to sink it into something that is energetically unfavorable for recovery, which means you also need to expand a huge amount of energy to sink the carbon into that energetically unfavorable state.",

Let's assume that a decent indoor environment has 300 ppm more CO2 This means that our threshold for when people start getting drowsy even in decent indoor environments is when atmospheric CO2 reaches 700 ppm. For reference, it is currently around 420 ppm, and pre-industrial levels were 280 ppm.From https://www.climate.gov/news-features/understanding-climate/..., the pessimistic projections suggest that we may reach our 700 ppm threshold by roughly 2070; 45 years from now. (The graphs are hard to read precisely)The 300 ppm offset compared to the outside air is naturally just an arbitrary number, everything up to 1000 ppm (meaning everything up to 580 ppm more than atmospheric levels) is considered \"acceptable\". That means any increase in CO2 concentration will take an indoor environment which used to be considered \"acceptable\" and make it cross the threshold into \"unacceptable\". An indoor environment which would've been at 900 ppm around the industrial revolution (280 ppm) would've crossed the threshold when we surpassed 380 ppm (which was in 1965 according to https://www.statista.com/statistics/1091926/atmospheric-conc...).let's compare the past 20 years. In 2004, the concentration was ~377 ppm. That's 47 ppm lower than what was in 2024. An indoor environment which was \"borderline but acceptable\" at 955 ppm CO2 in 2004 would've crossed the arbitrary 1000 ppm threshold by now, and therefore would benefit from a CO2 scrubber. The next 20 years will likely have a higher increase than the past 20 years, so there will be a larger range of currently acceptable indoor environments which will cross the 1000 ppm threshold by 2045.TL;DR: It's complicated, 20 years is arbitrary, but as CO2 concentrations increase, indoor quality gets worse so indoor environments which were already bad will become worse. 45 years is a more realistic estimate for when your typical good indoor environment will become unacceptable, but it's a gradient.",

      "abstract": "该讨论围绕“2025年是Windows 11的灾难”这一标题展开，核心话题是用户对Windows 11系统设计方向及整体体验的争议。有人认为系统界面更新流于表面，如文件管理器右键菜单仅是旧功能的“新外衣”，且设置与控制面板功能重叠混乱，体现了微软长期以来的设计退化。也有用户指出，许多批评可能过于针对技术社区，而普通用户实际体验尚可，甚至有人表示全新安装后日常使用并无严重问题。讨论中普遍认同的是，微软强推微软账户登录、系统集成AI功能（如Copilot）且商业软件对Windows的依赖，让用户感到自主权受限。分歧点在于：一方认为Windows正背离“个人计算”初衷，转向企业控制的“公司计算”模式；另一方则肯定其生态价值，认为Linux游戏兼容性虽在进步，但专业软件支持不足使Windows仍不可替代。此外，有观点将微软、谷歌等巨头押注AI的行为比作“高管毒品”，质疑其牺牲核心产品的合理性。",

But it is a new coat of paint over the ones from 10 or before. Additional options from for example 7zip don't show up in it. You have to click \"more options\" at the bottom which them reveals the old menu. There is no benefit to the new menu except for the fact that it is aesthetically more \"modern\" to its detriment.",

I don’t use the built-in email client or the other features this article complains about and I don’t feel like I’m missing anything.The centered start menu isn’t my favorite, but it’s not like it’s unusable. I didn’t find it difficult to adjust the interface and hide things I didn’t like in the first few minutes.On the other hand, my experience with the latest macOS and iOS 26 has been incredibly frustrating. I’m almost to the point where my basic apps have worked around new macOS bugs. My iOS phone is stuttering and laggy for unclear reasons and searches show I’m not alone.

For example, I never see any ads. Maybe there is a setting I turned off long ago, but I cannot recall ever seeing an ad. The setting must be persistent with my Windows backups because no ads show when I reinstall Windows and restore the settings and configuration from a backup.\nThings are not always perfect, but the issues I have encountered are relatively minor all things considered.",

Pfff can’t do that on Linux”.Then the Steam Deck came out, and I was skeptical. I was wrong. Gaming on Linux could happen, it was happening. Proton and the strides made in Wine in the past decade or so have been amazing.A month ago I installed a few different distros to “try out gaming on Linux”. I was shocked when Cyberpunk with mods worked with a little tinkering. Not only that, but it performed extremely well.So if you’re on the fence, try it. Also all my tools still work ;).p.s.

I'm not sure what that might look like, but the easiest route is to probably rebase Windows atop Linux, with a WINE emulation layer to start with to keep compatibility with old apps, as they transition/port their cash cows to Linux/Rust. Rust has been in their sights for a long time now and seems MS is committed to it. They have a 4+ decade long legacy and it needs to be shed, not hauled into the future forever. It will breathe new life into MS. They know they need it. Question is, is Nadella the one to pull this off?",

It was a pretty easy move, and practically all software I needed has a Linux version. Plex, Agent DVR (security cams), and the LSI-Megaraid admin software for my RAIDs all runs on Linux. Moving the RAID was the easiest part, I just moved the LSI card from the Windows system to the Linux system and drives just showed up instantly. Of course they are formatted as NTFS, and it would be better for Linux if they were formatted as something else, but I'm working on moving ~35TB of stuff off to a backup server so I can reformat those RAID drives, then move all the data back.The last VM I need to move to Linux is a somewhat complex Windows 10 IIS webserver setup that is still running on a Windows VM. I have to figure out a bunch of stuff to make that move to Linux happen, but I will do that soon enough.Microsoft can fuck off, I'm done with them after 30 years. They have made it clear I am not their target audience anymore, and I won't recommend their products to anyone anymore.",

Windows 11 nags a lot more, whether it's about OneDrive or Copilot or whatever new thing Microsoft is trying to push. My same Windows 11 install from 2 years ago kept reinstalling and re-enabling the same crap I originally got rid of, and I feel like it's only getting worse.In short I think Windows 11 was actually really good when it first launched, minus the UI quirks at the time.

A private company, let's call it AgeVerify, issues scratch-off cards with unique tokens on them. They are basically like gift cards.2. AgeVerify's scratch-off cards are sold exclusively in IRL stores. Preferably liquor stores, adult stores, and/or tobacco/vape shops. Places that are licensed and check ID.3. Anyone who wants to verify their age online can purchase a token at a store. The store must only demand ID if the buyer appears to be a minor (similar to alcohol or tobacco purchases). The store must never store the ID in any form whatsoever.4. Giving or selling these tokens to a minor is a criminal offense. If a store does it, they lose their liquor or tobacco license. Treat it just like giving a minor alcohol or tobacco.4a. Run public service announcement campaigns to communicate that giving an AgeVerify token to a child is like handing them a cigarette. There should be a clear social taboo associated with the legal ban.5. The buyer of the AgeVerify token enters it into their account on whatever social media or adult website they want to use. The website validates the code with AgeVerify.6. Once validated, the code is good for 1 year (or 6 months or 3 months, adjust based on how stringent you want to make it) - then it expires and a new one must be purchased.7. A separate token is required for each website/each account.8. The website is responsible for enforcing no account sharing.No identifying information is stored anywhere.

They are also aware that people walk-around age verification checks with e.g. fake ID cards, possibly AI generated.I'm not sure if it is actually doable reliabily, and I'm not sure either that the MPs that will have to vote the law will know the topic as well as the MPs participating in these committees.I would personally consider other options like a one-button admin config for computers/smartphones/tablets that restricts access according to age (6-14, 15-18) and requiring online service providers to announce their \"rating\" in HTTP headers. Hackers will certainly object that young hackers could bypass this, but like copy-protection, the mission can be considered complete when the vast majority of people are prevented from doing what they should not do.Alternatively one could consider the creation of a top-level domain with a \"code of content\" (which could include things like \"chat control\") enforced by controlling entity. Then again, an OS-level account config button could restrict all Internet accesses to this domain.Perhaps an national agency could simply grant a \"child safe\" label to operating systems that comply to this.This type of solutions would I think also be useful in schools (e.g. school-provided devices), although they are also talking about severely limiting screen-time at school.For the french speakers, see:[1] https://videos.assemblee-nationale.fr/video.17950525_6942684...[2] https://videos.assemblee-nationale.fr/video.17952051_6942761...",

It's a last ditched effort bandaid solution to keep the dam from bursting.

They will never openly announce true motives as that would hinder the objective. The comments I am seeing are awfully similar to the confusion and fierce debate I see around wrestling control of TikTok, which have largely been blamed on China, but the concern around uncensored videos of atrocities committed in the middle east reaching hundreds of millions of young people that has shifted steadfast opinions of a certain country which for decades were positive, now show significant departure among age brackets within the same political camp which shocked a lot of old people from that same side.Perception is everything and the question \"asking for a source on if these bans popular\" completely misses the mark and irrelevant, rather the more interesting question is,\"will these bans that limit freedom of information and speech escalate and proliferate in the near future and whether France, Australia, Korea is just the start?\"\" will the countries reviewing ban like new zealand, greece, canada invite more countries to join the trend?\"\" why are these bans being accelerated in countries that have seen a large wave of migrations that are causing major frictions?\"",

It's a step beyond something like bare raylib or SDL2, but it's a far cry from Unreal, which lets you think in terms of game entities from the very start: \"here's the map, here's where the player will spawn, here, add some buildings and you can run around them\".With MonoGame/XNA/FNA, LOVE2D, libGDX, HaxeFlixel you are getting a bunch of tools instead, which is probably not bad if you like coding and your game doesn't fit into one of existing popular genres.",

Because the ChatGPT output wouldn't be reviewed!You buy books like these exactly because they are written by a professional, who has taken the time to divide it up into easily digestible chunks which form a coherent narrative, with runnable intermediate stages in-between.For example, I expect a raytracing project to start with simple ray casting of single-color objects. After that it can add things like lights and Blinn-Phong shading, progress with Whitted-style recursive raytracing for the shiny reflections and transparent objects, then progress to modern path tracing with things like BRDFs, and end up with BVHs to make it not horribly slow.You can stop at any point and still end up with a functional raytracer, and the added value of each step is immediately obvious to the reader. There's just no way in hell ChatGPT at its current level is going to guide you flawlessly through all of that if you start with a simple \"I want to build a raytracer\" prompt!",

          "content": "I had written and self-published three books, and in 2024 decided to publish the most successful one with O'Reilly. It went up for sale in December 2024.The whole experience was wonderful. I had basically none of the problems that this fellow experienced with his publisher, and I am delighted about how it went.I did some things differently. For one, I had already been selling the book on my own for a few years, and was essentially on the 3rd self-published edition.  Because of this, they were able to see what the almost-finished product was.I told them I would not make massive changes to the book, nor would I contort it to the AI trend (the book barely mentions AI at all), and they never pressured me once.Their biggest contribution was their team of editors. This book has code on just about every page. I had 3 technical editors go through it, finding many bugs. How many? Let's just say \"plenty\".And the feedback from the non-technical editors was, to my surprise, even more valuable. Holy crap, I cannot express to you how much they improved the book. There were several of these folks (I had no idea there were so many different specialties for editors), and all of them were great.(They also accepted my viewpoint when I disagreed with them, immediately, every time. The final published version of the book was 100% my own words.)From all of that, I made improvements on what must have been almost every page, and rewrote two chapters from scratch. I also added a new chapter (I volunteered for it, no one at any point pressured me to do that). The result was making a book that IMO is at least twice as good as what I was able to accomplish on my own.I do not resonate with the article author's comments about compensation. He negotiated a pretty good deal, I think; it's not realistic to get much better than what he did, since the publisher is a business with their own expenses to pay, etc.I was pretty disciplined about meeting deadlines that we agreed to for certain milestones. That helped my relationship with the publisher, obviously.All in all, it was a great experience, and I am glad I did it this way.Reading the article, it sounds like my publisher (oreilly) was better to work with than his, but I think he could have done some things differently also. In the end, though, I agree with him that it was best to walk away in his situation.",

The author can concede or (usually) give up the project.One important aspect to this is that a typical first-book technical author knows well the subject matter, and sometimes knows how to write too (but usually not, as was my case), but does not know  how to edit, typeset, publish, market, and sell well. That's what the publisher knows best.

Like Austin's book it contains a CHIP8 chapter and a couple chapters on making a programming language. The difference with regards to his experience and my experience in writing it with a traditional publisher, is that I was an experienced author so I felt comfortable finishing the entire book first before shopping it around to publishers. I didn't want too much scrutiny around the core concept and I was getting similar signals of \"every chapter must have AI.\"I wrote a similar blog post a month ago describing the process of creating the book and getting it published called \"Writing Computer Science from Scratch\":https://www.observationalhazard.com/2025/12/writing-computer...Some in this thread have wondered what publisher Austin was working with. Based on my experience working with three different technical publishers and the setup and terms Austin was offered, my educated guess would be Manning.I will critique the blog post a little bit. It's presented as a critique of the experience of working with the publisher, but ultimately I'm reading between the lines that the book failed because he was missing deadlines. He wrote that \"life got in the way\" and I think he lost his motivation only partially because the publisher wanted AI in more of the book. Many of the trials he had along the way: dealing with a development editor who wants to tailor your style to a particular audience, a technical editor who needs a couple chapters to warmup, back and forth on the proposal, etc. these are all really par for the course when writing a technical book. Ultimately you have to be self-motivated to finish because of course the development editor, technical editor, etc are going to disagree with you from time to time and try to push you in different directions. If that alone is so demotivating to you, it's just not for you to work with a publisher.PS I think his blog is really good and he should think about self publishing under a time frame and terms he is more comfortable with.",

It took many months of negotiating to finalize the agreement and then they wanted the manuscript in ~7 months from contract signing. I guess they also assumed that I'd miss at least one deadline but instead I took a bunch of time off to get it done. I think the most important lesson for me is that book publishing, unless you're focused on trying to be the top 1% (maybe even .1%) in a popular category, is not going to be very lucrative, especially with a publisher that takes a major cut. It's easier than ever to go direct, in my case because I had a niche book and I wasn't doing it for money, I valued the prestige (or perceived prestige anyways) of having a book with a name brand publisher as I thought it'd be more helpful for my career in other ways, and candidly was mostly a passion project that I didn't feel strongly about monetizing!If any folks want to talk about nonfiction publishing, I'm always happy to chat as many people were incredibly generous with their time for me and I'd like to try to pay it forward.",

It's so much more useful to identify behaviors to learn from - either to emulate or to avoid - than to debate whether various public figures are good or bad people.That said, it makes me a little sad that we've read the last of his annual letters.",

Buffett actually made money off it, and kept his hands off the direction of the paper. We all saw how much Bezos started leaning on it - which has had the effect of shedding subscribers as no one trusts it any more, and it's not attracting new readers of...  the Fox News persuasion I guess we can call it.It also seems he mostly stuck to what he knows in terms of kind of boring investments rather than flashy rockets and other showy things.And of course he's been good with giving his money away and convincing others to do likewise.",

Like many ultra wealthy people who are caught up in evaluating companies solely on financial grounds, Buffet ignores what the impact of his choices are. And let’s be real - there isn’t any “fair competition” in many parts of the American economy to fix these problems. The railways are especially problematic because the infrastructure they own creates monopolies in regions.",

The professionals who succeed are those who understand what the AI is doing, validate the output rigorously, and maintain clear mental models of their system.This becomes especially important for code quality and technical debt.

Regular 5.2 models, and 5.2 codex, are leagues better than GPT-4 when it comes to solving problems procedurally, using tools, and deep discussion of scientific, mathematic, philosophical and engineering problems.Models have increasingly longer context, especially some Google models. OpenAI has released very good image models, and great editing-focused image models in general have been released. Predictably better multimodal inference over the short term is unlocking many cool near-term possibilities.Additionally, we have seen some incredible open source and open weight models released this year. Some fully commercially viable without restriction. And more and more smaller TTS/STT projects are in active development, with a few notable releases this year.Honestly, the landscape at the end of the year is impressive. There has been great work all over the place, almost too much to keep up with. I'm very interested in the Genie models and a few others.For an idea:At the beginning of the year, I was mildly successful getting at coding models to make changes in some of my codebases, but the more esoteric problems were out of reach. Progress in general was deliberate and required a lot of manual intervention.By comparison, in the last week I've prototyped six applications at levels that would take me days to weeks individually, often developing multiple at the same time, monitoring agentic workflows and intervening only when necessary, relying on long preproduction phases with architectural discussions and development of documentation, requirements, SDDs... and detailed code review and refactoring processes to ensure adherence to constraints.

I’m sure the heads at GE wish they hadn’t sold that off now.On steam/gas turbine blade manufacturing there most certainly are more big players than 4 and many US based.

Multiple innovations enabled this incredible achievement, but the energy strategy was the most impressive.> Again, clever firms like xAI have found remedies.

If you don't build a FTS5 index and import without WAL (--unsafe-mode), import of every reddit comment and submission takes a bit over 24 hours and produces a ~10TB DB.SQLite offers a lot of cool json features that would let you store the raw json and operate on that, but I eschewed them in favor of parsing only once at load time. THat also lets me normalize the data a bit.I find that building the DB is pretty \"fast\", but queries run much faster if I immediately vacuum the DB after building it.

Because if your copy isn't local all those network pulls take a while.The sequence of shards you saw when you paginated to days is faciliated by the static-manifest which maps HN item ID ranges to shards, and since IDs are increasing and a pretty good proxy of time (a \"HN clock\"), we can also map the shards that we cut up by ID to the time spans their items cover. An in memory table sorted by time is created from the manifest on load so we can easily look up which shard we need when you pick a day.Funnily enough, this system was thrown off early on by a handful of \"ID/timestamp\" outliers in the data: items with weird future timestamps (offset by a couple years), or null timestamps. To cleanse our pure data from this noise, and restore proper adjacent-in-time shard cuts we just did a 1/99 percentile grouping and discarded the outliers leaving shards with sensible 'effective' time spans.Sometimes we end up fetching two shards when you enter a new day because some items' comments exist \"cross shard\". We needed another index for that and it lives in cross-shard-index.bin which is just a list of 4-byte item IDs that have children in more than 1 shard (2-bytes), which occurs when people have the self-indulgence to respond to comments a few days after a post has died down ;)Thankfully HN imposes a 2 week horizon for replies so there aren't that many cross-shard comments (those living outside the 2-3 days span of most, recent, shards).

If in the decision making the idea of an offering is added in then it brings up the possibility of gauging trust and building trust so that future actions can capture more value until an optimal infinite policy is attained. So, for instance, I look at all my possible options and I choose one based on how much I trust the other party AND how much I want to increase that trust in the future. So I give them an offering, select an option that gives them a little more but at a cost to me, to prove that I am willing to increase trust. If they reciprocate then I loose nothing and the next offering can be bigger. If they don't then I gained knowledge and my next offering is smaller. Basically, this is like tit for tat but over time and intended to get to the optimal solution instead of the min max solution. Clearly I'm not a mathematician, but I bet this could be refined to exact equations and formalized so that exact offerings could be calculated.",

How forgiving people are and how tolerant they are to deception, abuse and immorality. I hate to say it but a lot of people are attracted to abusers. They keep going back to the same kinds of people who will abuse them over and over. These same people who tolerate abuse often seem to show disrespect and look down on good, honest people. I cannot overstate how powerful this effect is; and it seems to be getting worse over time! And these people keep coming up with narratives to gaslight themselves about their abusers \"they're not so bad\"... People will especially do this when their abuser has power over them (Stockholm Syndrome).Once you factor these two things, cheating is the clear winning strategy. By a mile... It's objectively a superior strategy. If we just follow game theory; it will take us somewhere really dark. Game theory isn't what's keeping the world civilized. Society literally all rests on people's irrational emotions and moral principles.The desire to do the right thing is completely irrational and is a net loss to the individual. If we continue with the current system and current assumptions, all moral individuals will be wiped out because they are at a HUGE disadvantage. To solve our social problems, we need to be more moral; we need to learn to judge ourselves and other people through the lens of morality and be very firm about it.",

Especially when just sentences before the issue of climate change came up, which certainly is not a positive sum game and we would be lucky if it was a zero sum game, but given all evidence it is very obviously a negative sum game, where governments get to talk about who has to bear the most pain. (And it isn't clear that cooperation even is the best opportunity for survival)The optimism strikes me as so blindingly naive that it makes it hard to take anything said seriously. Maybe this is just a generational divide, many of the older people I know, in their 40s or older, seem much more optimistic about the state of the world.

Broad collaboration and institution building is always the only way out of the hole, although the hole can be very deep and collaboration can be very costly until you get out.You are right though, that for an individual living in a good collaborative system, often cheating is very effective, it's just that the system can only handle a certain amount of that behavior before it collapses.As is discussed in the first scene of Plato's The Republic (surprisingly entertaining to modern tastes), the best play tends to be \"to be unjust while seeming just\". If people are going to be assholes, it is actually much better if they are discrete about it and keep a pretense of civilization.

You are absolutely right about the \"Finite Game\".\nIf you can reset your reputation and start over, \"Cheating\" is indeed the winning strategy.However, here in Japan, we have a different operating system called \"Shinise\" (companies lasting over 1,000 years). They play an \"Infinite Game\".\nTheir reputation is tied to a \"Noren\" (shop curtain) or a family name that has been built over centuries. You cannot simply discard it and respawn.There is a movie hitting theaters here in Tokyo right now called \"KOKUHO\" (National Treasure). It depicts Kabuki actors who inherit a \"Name\" (Myoseki) with 400 years of history.\nWatching it, I realized: In their world, cheating doesn't just mean losing a job. It means \"killing the Name\" for all ancestors and future generations. The penalty is infinite.When the \"Reset Button\" is removed from the game, \"Honesty\" and \"Sanpo-yoshi\" (Three-way satisfaction) naturally become the mathematically dominant strategies.\nCheating only works when you plan to exit.",

Anyone in the world can already get cheap, mass-produced software to do almost anything they want their computer to do. Compilers spit out new build of any program on demand within seconds, and you can usually get both source code and pre-compiled copies over the internet. The \"industrial process\" (as TFA puts it) of production and distribution is already handled perfectly well by CI/CD systems and CDNs.What software developers actually do is closer to the role of an architect in construction or a design engineer in manufacturing. They design new blueprints for the compilers to churn out. Like any design job, this needs some actual taste and insight into the particular circumstances. That has always been the difficult part of commercial software production and LLMs generally don't help with that.It's like thinking the greatest barrier to producing the next great Russian literary novel is not speaking Russian. That is merely the first and easiest barrier, but after learning the language you are still no Tolstoy.",

If you look from first principles, it's clear that physical goods and software don't share the same properties and thus the analogy falls apart.Physical goods like clothes or cars have variable costs. The marginal unit always costs > 0, and thus the price to the consumer is always greater than zero. Industrialization lowered this variable cost, while simultaneously increasing production capacity, and thus enabled a new segment of \"low cost, high volume\" products, but it does not eliminate the variable cost. This variable cost (eg. the cost of a hand made suit) is the \"umbrella\" under which a low cost variant (factory made clothes) has space to enter the market.Digital goods have zero marginal cost. Many digital goods do not cost anything at all to the consumer! Or they are as cheap as possible to actively maximize users because their costs are effectively fixed. What is the \"low value / low cost\" version of Google? or Netflix for that matter? This is non-sensical because there's no space for a low cost entrant to play in when the price is already free.In digital goods, consumers tend to choose on quality because price is just not that relevant of a dimension. You see this in the market structure of digital goods. They tend to be winner (or few) take all because the best good can serve everyone. That is a direct result of zero marginal cost.Even if you accept the premise that AI will make software \"industrialized\" and thus cheaper to produce, it doesn't change the fact that most software is already free or dirt cheap.The version of this that might make sense is software that is too expensive to make at all because the market size (eg. number of consumers * price they would pay) is less than the cost of the software developer / entrpreneurs time. But by definition those are small markets, and not anything like the huge markets that were enabled by physical good industrialization.",

If we look at other sectors, we see that even those with the highest levels of industrialisation also still benefit from small-scale, human-led production as part of the spectrum of output.\n    > For example, prior to industrialisation, clothing was largely produced by specialised artisans, often coordinated through guilds and manual labour, with resources gathered locally, and the expertise for creating durable fabrics accumulated over years, and frequently passed down in family lines. Industrialisation changed that completely, with raw materials being shipped intercontinentally, fabrics mass produced in factories, clothes assembled by machinery, all leading to today’s world of fast, disposable, exploitative fashion. And yet handcrafted clothes still exist: from tailored suits to knitted scarves, a place still exists for small-scale, slow production of textile goods, for reasons ranging from customisation of fit, signalling of wealth, durability of product, up to enjoyment of the craft as a pastime.",

It is. But if you look at actual industrial design processes, their equivalent of \"writing the code\" is relatively small. Quality assurance, compliance to various legal requirements, balancing different requirements for the product at hand, having endless meetings with customer representatives to figure out requirements in the first place, those are where most of the time goes and those are exactly the places where LLMs are not very good.

From accounting to engineering to home budgets - there are few people who haven't used a spreadsheet to \"program\" the computer at some point.It's a fantastic tool, but has limits. It's also fair to say people use (abuse) spreadsheets far beyond those limits. It's a fantastic tool for accounting, but real accounting systems exist for a reason.Similarly AI will allow lots more people to \"program\" their computer. But making the programing task go away just exposes limitations in other parts of the \"development\" process.To your analogy I don't think AI does mass-produced paperbacks. I think it is the equivalent of writing a novel for yourself. People don't sell spreadsheets, they use them.

For a pool size of 30%, at least 24 confirmations should be required in Bitcoin, but 49 in Monero with its stricter ε=1e-6. You can see the table and the math at https://gist.github.com/impredicative/0907e1699f5ff97a9fed5d... and again it's all cleanly reproducible from the whitepaper.

          "content": "Part of this post addresses the economics of creating a 6 block re-org. This makes sense as 6-confimations is the standard for Bitcoin finality today.However, as Bitcoin's security inevitably weakens over the coming years due to diminishing miner rewards (denominated in BTC), I believe this \"6-confimation\" acceptance policy will change to include not only the number of confirmations, but the timing of those confirmations as well. Consider a scenario where an exchange deciding whether a tx with 6-confirmations that took 4 hours to arrive (this happens occasionally) is safe to consider finalized/settled. Even though 6-confimations may be considered safe by today's acceptance policies, this tx would still have a high probability of double spend due to the assumed 4-hour long wait for the 6 confirmations (as the attacker would have 4 hours to produce 7 blocks instead of the normal/expected 1 hour). Instead of ignoring block interarrival timing, it may make sense to include block timing as part of an acceptance policy.So, going forward Bitcoin acceptance policies may change from today's 6-confirmation standard to something more complicated that involves the amount of time those blocks took to arrive. This would significantly enhance Bitcoin's double spending resistance without adding/altering any code and may give the network a much needed security boost in the coming years to prevent the attack discussed in the post.",

Saves you from having to go to the trash bin every time.* Preheat watery vegetables in the microwave. Things like onions, mushrooms, etc. are mostly water, and you can avoid having to wait for them to reduce in a pan by nuking them for 2 minutes in the microwave first.* When boiling water or cooking almost anything in a pot, cover it with the lid! It will trap the heat inside the pot and boil/cook faster. So many people don’t use the lid just to save themselves from having to wash it. The only time not to use the lid is if you need to reduce the liquid or allow volatiles to escape.* Cooking bigger batches of food takes essentially the same amount of time as smaller batches. Make portions big enough that you can get at least two or three more meals from it.* Learn to use your oven! Too many people get enamored with single use gadgets when the oven already does so many things. People complain that it takes too long to heat up but it really doesn’t.* Keep your knives sharp: Do NOT use an electric sharpener, just a simple drag over a stone every few months is probably all you need. A sharp knife is SAFER than a dull one.* Throw away all cutting boards not made of wood or plastic (dump the plastic too if you’re concerned about it).

I thought these were just for people who frequently cook huge meals for large gatherings but we moved into a house with one, used the top oven constantly, and it became a must-have when it was time to replace the range.I got a gigantic weston vacuum sealer for Christmas one year.  Fortunately we have the counter space for it, and drawer space beneath it for the bags, in our pantry.  In the amounts we cook it's taken a long time to break even on any cost savings but it's a quality of life game changer.  Plus sous vide.  In a world where less-than-super-premium American butchery has gone from mediocre to downright sloppy in my lifetime, it's very, very nice being able to break down big roasts and subprimals into chops and steaks and smaller roasts etc and trim them up nicely and freeze whatever we're not going to use immediately.  I tie roasts before freezing them.Just buy the big box of sharpies for the kitchen.  They walk off and dry out and get that weird thing that happens when they touch something oily.  I mark things like super-duper-pasteurized dairy products with the date opened.  I'm not michelin-star disciplined about using painter's tape for other containers.

One-pot meals means less fussing with trying to get multiple dishes to be ready at the same time.I keep a Google doc of our dinner recipes. These are things that we know everyone likes, and usually I make tweaks to Internet recipes to either make them more to my taste, or easier to make. It also means I can split the effort -- my wife picks what we're having from our list and shops for the ingredients. Then I cook. If you have around 20 recipes you can just keep rotating and not get tired of them, and I like that I get to practice making the same recipes and make little changes to improve how I cook them each time.Basically dinner takes very little thought or effort right now. Which is great for the stage of my life I am in right now. It doesn't always have to be this structured but it's nice to have an easy fallback.",

          "content": "Our studio, LucasFonts, designed Calibri. Here are our CEO Luc(as) de Groot’s thoughts on the matter:Back to bad...Deciding to ditch Calibri as a ‘wasteful diversity’ font is both hilarious and sad. I designed Calibri to make reading on modern computer screens easier, and in 2006 Microsoft chose it to replace Times New Roman as the default font in the Office suite. Microsoft moved away from Times for good reasons. Calibri performs exceptionally well at small sizes and on standard office monitors, whereas serif fonts like Times New Roman create more visual disturbance. Although serif fonts work well on high-resolution displays, such as those found on modern smartphones, the serifs can introduce unnecessary visual noise on typical office screens and be particularly problematic for users with impaired vision, such as older adults.Professional typography can be achieved with serif or sans serif fonts. However, that is not very easy with Times New Roman, a typeface older than the current president. Originally crafted in Great Britain for newspaper printing, Times was optimised for paper, with each letterform meticulously cut and tested for specific sizes. In the digital era, larger-size drawings were repurposed as models, resulting in a typeface that appears too thin and sharp when printed at a high quality.Depending on the situation, fonts with serifs are often considered more classic, but they take more work to get right. While a skilled typographer can produce excellent results with Times New Roman, using the digital default version is not considered professional practice. This font only offers two weights, Regular and Bold, and the Bold version has a very different design that does not fit well. There are many better serif typefaces available. The digital version of Times New Roman, developed in the early days of computing, includes only minimal adjustments to letter pairs. This is particularly noticeable in all-capital words such as ‘CHICAGO’, where the spacing is inconsistent: the letters ‘HIC’ are tightly packed, while ‘CAG’ are spaced too far apart. By contrast, Calibri incorporates extensive spacing adjustments and language-specific refinements.This decision takes the administration back to the past and back to bad.(Microsoft could not rectify spacing issues in Times New Roman without altering the appearance of existing documents.)",

There is NO \"natural\" or \"universal\" formality or even authority without human social input.I would also argue that, though most users cannot distinguish between a serif and sans serif font, they DO understand the serif fonts connote formality. eg in high school they were told to submit their papers in a serif font, or where they read a court opinion they also read serif (even if not the same font).Sure, the State Department could have selected a different serif font.

I personally think Times isn't a great choice for the reasons articulated in that statement (something open and more legible seems better to me), but I don't think it's a horrible choice either (it's standard and efficient with space). If the State Department wants to use a certain font, it's their prerogative.What bothers me about the decision is their rationale. If they had just switched without any explanation, it would have seemed more judicious and politic, befitting a department of state. Even better would be to announce a thoughtful font choice with reasoning based on the font itself, without defaulting to some thoughtless option \"because that's the way it was done in the past\", and moving away from the existing choice \"because DEI\". As it is, in my opinion, they made themselves look like idiots by obsessing over fonts from the perspective of something like DEI, as if they are paranoid over any possible subatom of DEI infecting their presence. Rubio couldn't just make it about the font, so to speak, he had to get hung up on irrelevant details which makes him (in my opinion) look worse than anything he might be criticizing.If you read the original announcement, my impression was that the choice of Calibri was because it it made state department functions easier as Calibri was the default in commonly used software (which seems kind of a poor reason to me, but one I can respect on practicality grounds). Legibility was also a concern (as it should be in my opinion). So something functional about Calibri (legibility) becomes \"DEI\" which is almost like cooties for this administration. Even if you disagree about the legibility of Calibri, denouncing legibility as a criterion per se seems absurd to me.The whole decision seems like a joke to me and a lost opportunity to set a decent design standard.",

Higher quality TV dramas shoot at 24 FPS, intentionally forcing the 3:2 pulldown for TV presentation to signal \"no, compare me to a movie not those other TV shows\".There are many areas in our life where we're judging things by this signalling criteria, and not by any real objective measure, yet people will often invent objective measures to assuage themselves that their values aren't so easily manipulated.

Achieving that goal requires a different approach—different typefaces, different column widths, different writing conventions. Briefs are like books rather than newspapers.

          "content": "As indicated in the article, serifs come from how original letters were carved into stones: they were an artifact of the tool in use.Calligraphy developed similar traits by virtue of using a tool that produced an oval shape, and that you had to take care not to leave marks when pen/feather leaves the paper.With the printing press, when we became able to put many books out, we did start also doing some research about what makes a book easy to read.  Not least of because we could now easily put many characters on a single line and print it in the thousands.Serif or cursive fonts were the default \"content\" type, and sans-serif was reserved for titles, shop names and other \"short texts\" as a more \"modern\", cleaner look: serifs do indeed allow one to more easily track a single long line of text, as you can more clearly see the \"baseline\" and not accidentally skip into the line above or below.The next challenge is switching to the next line once you are done with the one you are on: while serifs help there too, the more important thing is the line length.  Thus the famous (is it? :) 60-70 word limit for a line, and why you also see many web pages that only take like 20% of our modern 32\"+ screens when browsers are made full screen.Now, columnar layout as popularized by newspapers does not really come from the same desire: like TMR, it actually comes from the desire to fit more on one page to save on costs.  With a wider column of text, all the last lines of paragraphs would average out at being half-empty, which is quite a bit with a wide column.Sure, low resolution screens made sans-serif inevitable even for documents, but compare that with the earliest segmented LCD screens: font was what you could get rendered with as little electronics as possible :)But today, serif fonts on high resolution screens (though there are still 32\" Full HD screens which are not really high-resolution), or with the use of subpixel rendering (antialiasing is no match, as you can see by connecting a modern Mac to a non-high res screen) are a great choice if you want to limit the space you use and maintain great readability.However, sans-serif fonts can work as well, and you may only need to go with a larger line spacing or shorter lines.  The trick is to aim for a number of words/letters, and not \"pixels\", though modern CSS treats them as a scalable unit.(Sorry for all of this being a bit rambly, just wanted to share a bit of the history along with how we can best apply it today)",

      "abstract": "该讨论围绕“2026年是否会成为Java在终端工具领域崛起之年”展开。核心争议在于Java是否适合开发命令行工具。有人认为Java因构建打包复杂、启动慢、依赖运行时环境而难以与Go、Rust等语言竞争，指出GraalVM虽能优化但仍带来额外复杂度。也有用户指出，Java 21已支持单文件直接运行，且Babashka等工具已证明其在终端中的实用性，新框架也变得更轻量。讨论中提到，技术选择不仅关乎理性优劣，也受文化因素影响，例如Python打包体验不佳却依然流行。部分共识认为，Java在终端开发中的性能问题常被夸大，实际使用中与C++、Rust差异不大，尤其非大型Web应用时启动速度并非关键瓶颈。分歧主要集中于Java的工具链成熟度与生态适应性。",

There were several check moments and data validation after that, but sales numbers remained as they were.The conclusion was that affiliate marketing claimed a lot of sales in their reporting, but the brand was strong enough (this company was #2 by market share in the country and #1 on most brand metrics) to get those customers without affiliate links.",

          "content": "In my experience, sometimes your employer blatantly lies to you about what you're making and how it'll be used. I was once recruited to work on a software installer which could build and sign dynamic collections of software which was meant to be used to conveniently install several packages at once. Like, here's a set of handy tools for X task, here are the default apps we install on machines for QA people, here is our suite of apps for whatever. It seemed to have genuine utility because it could pull data in real time to ensure it was all patched and current and so on. That could be great for getting new machines up and running quickly. Several options exist for this use case today, but didn't then as far as I recall. This was on Windows.Ultimately it was only used to install malware in the form of browser extensions, typically disguised as an installer for some useful piece of software like Adobe Acrobat. It would guide you through installing some 500 year old version of Acrobat and sneakily unload the rest of the garbage for which we would be paid, I don't know, 25 cents to a couple dollars per install. Sneaking Chrome onto people's machines was great money for a while. At one point we were running numbers of around $150k CAD per day just dumping trash into unsuspecting people's computers.At no point in the development of that technology were we told it was going to ruin countless thousands of people's browsers or internet experiences in general. For quite a while the CEO played a game with me where I'd find bad actors on the network and report them to him. He'd thank me and assure me they were on top of figuring out who was behind it. Eventually I figured out that the accounts were in fact his. They let me go shortly after that with generous severance.I don't miss anything about ad tech. It was such a disheartening introduction to the software world. It's really the armpit and asshole of tech, all at once.",

Beyond object-level research, Scry a good tool for exploring and acquiring intuitions about embedding-space.2) An agent-native text-to-SQL + lexical + semantic deep research workflow. We have a prompt that's been heavily optimized for taking full advantage of our machine and Claude Code for exploration and answering nuanced questions. Claude fires off many exploratory queries and builds towards really big queries that lean on the SQL query planner. You can interrupt at any time.

When my dog had a reaction to one of them, I asked ChatGPT about the symptoms, which ultimately prompted me to take her to the emergency vet.A couple of weeks ago, I also asked about the symptoms of sodium overdose. I had eaten ramen and then pho within about twelve hours and developed a headache. After answering my question, ChatGPT cleared the screen and displayed a popup urging me to seek help if I was considering harming myself.What has been genuinely transformative for me is getting actual answers—not just boilerplate responses like “consult your vet” or “consider talking to a medical professional.”This case is different, though. ChatGPT reinforced someone’s delusions. My concern is that OpenAI may overreact by broadly restricting the model’s ability to give its best, most informative responses.",

Intent is a crucial part of the law, and I wonder if we will see \"Yes we built this thing, but we had no idea it could do THIS\" as a legal defense.Or, more formally, \"these machines have an unprecedented, possibly unlimited, range of capabilities, and we could not have reasonably anticipated this.\"There was a thread a few weeks ago (https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45922848) about the AI copyright infringement lawsuits where I idly floated this idea. Turns out, in these lawsuits, no matter how you infringed, you're still liable if infringement can be proved. Analogously, in cases with death, even without explicit intent you can still be liable, e.g. if negligence led to the death.But the intent in these cases is non-existent! And the actions that led to this -- training on vast quantities of data -- are so abstracted from the actual incident that it's hard to make the case for negligence, because negligence requires some reasonable form of anticipation of the outcomes. For instance, it's very clear that these models were not designed to be \"rote-learning machines\" or \"suicide-ideation machines\", yet that turned out to be things they do! And who knows what weird failure modes will emerge over time (which makes me a bit sympathetic to the AI doomers' viewpoint.)So, clearly the questions are going to be all about whether the AI labs took sufficient precautions to anticipate and prevent such outcomes. A smoking gun would be an email or document outlining just such a threat that they dismissed (which may well exist, given what I hear about these labs' \"move fast, break people\" approach to safety.) But absent that it seems like a reasonable defense.While that argument may not work for this or other cases, I think it will pop up as these models cause more and more unexpected outcomes, and the courts will have to grapple with it eventually.",

It felt efficient, after all you only replace a i < len check with buf[i] != null inside your loop right?But of course it doesn't actually work that way, copying one byte at a time is inefficient so instead we copy as many as possible at once, which is easy to do with just a length check but not so easy if you need to find the null byte.

This is the ethos of \"parse, don't validate\".And you're correct that in that case you don't need the check to be close to the consumer, in fact you want the opposite, for the check to be as close to the software edge as possible such that tainted data has limited to no presence inside the system and it's difficult or impossible to unwittingly interact with it.But of course the farther into that direction you head the more expressive a type system you need. And some constraints are not so easily checked as there's a multitude of consumers each with their own foibles, or as in this case you need to check the interaction of multiple runtime objects.",

          "content": "Projects like this and Docker make me seriously wonder where software engineering is going. Don't get me wrong, I don't mean to criticize Docker or Toro in parcicular. It's the increasing dependency on such approaches that bothers me.Docker was conceived to solve the problem of things \"working on my machine\", and not anywhere else. This was generally caused by the differences in the configuration and versions of dependencies. Its approach was simple: bundle both of these together with the application in unified images, and deploy these images as atomic units.Somewhere along the lines however, the problem has mutated into \"works on my container host\". How is that possible? Turns out that with larger modular applications, the configuration and dependencies naturally demand separation. This results in them moving up a layer, in this case creating a network of inter-dependent containers that you now have to put together for the whole thing to start...  and we're back to square one, with way more bloat in between.Now hardware virtualization. I like how AArch64 generalizes this: there are 4 levels of privilege baked into the architecture. Each has control over the lower and can call up the one immediately above to request a service. Simple. Let's narrow our focus to the lowest three: EL0 (classically the user space), EL1 (the kernel), EL2 (the hypervisor). EL0, in most operating systems, isn't capable of doing much on its own; its sole purpose is to do raw computation and request I/O from EL1. EL1, on the other hand, has the powers to directly talk to the hardware.Everyone is happy, until the complexity of EL1 grows out of control and becomes a huge attack surface, difficult to secure and easy to exploit from EL0. Not good. The naive solution? Go a level above, and create a layer that will constrain EL1, or actually, run multiple, per-application EL1s, and punch some holes through for them to still be able to do the job—create a hypervisor. But then, as those vaguely defined \"holes\", also called system calls and hyper calls, grow, won't so the attack surface?Or in other words, with the user space shifting to EL1, will our hypervisor become the operating system, just like docker-compose became a dynamic linker?",

          "content_cn": "这类项目和Docker让我不禁认真思考软件工程的发展方向。别误会，我并非特意批评Docker或Toro。真正令我困扰的是业界对此类方案的日益依赖。Docker诞生的初衷是解决\"在我机器上能运行\"而别处无法运行的问题，这通常由依赖项的配置和版本差异导致。其解决方案很简单：将应用程序与配置、依赖项打包成统一镜像，并以原子单元形式部署这些镜像。\n\n然而不知从何时起，问题演变成了\"在我的容器主机上能运行\"。这怎么可能？事实证明，对于大型模块化应用，配置和依赖项天然需要分离。这导致它们向上迁移了一个层级，形成相互依赖的容器网络——现在必须组装这些容器才能启动整个系统……我们又回到了原点，只是中间环节变得更加臃肿。\n\n现在谈谈硬件虚拟化。我很欣赏AArch64的架构设计：它内置了四个特权级别。每个级别都能控制下级，并可调用紧邻的上级请求服务。这种设计很简洁。让我们聚焦最低的三个层级：EL0（传统用户空间）、EL1（内核）、EL2（虚拟机监控程序）。在大多数操作系统中，EL0本身能力有限；其唯一目的是执行原始计算和请求I/O……"

They grow from tools like chroot, BSD jails, and Solaris Zones. Containers allow to deploy dependencies that cannot be simultaneously installed on a traditional Unix host system. it's not a UNIX architecture limitation but rather a result of POSIX + tradition; e.g. Nix also solves this, but differently.Containers (like chroot and jail before them) also help ensure that a running service does not depend on the parts of the filesystem it wasn't given access to. Additionally, containers can limit network access, and process tree access.These limitations are not a proper security boundary, but definitely a dependency boundary, helping avoid spaghetti-style dependencies, and surprises like \"we never realized that our ${X} depends on ${Y}\".Then, there's the Fundamental Theorem of Software Engineering [1], which states:  \"We can solve any problem by introducing an extra level of indirection.\" So yes, expect the number of levels of indirection to grow everywhere in the stack. A wise engineer can expect to merge or remove a some levels here and there, when the need for them is gone, but they would never expect that new levels of indirection should stop emerging.[1]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fundamental_theorem_of_softwar...",

One can also realize that the surface area exposed by Linux is fundamentally much larger than that exposed by most hypervisors, and that the Linux `unshare` mechanism is insecure by default. It's kind of funny - the invocation of Linux really undermines this argument; there's no _reason_ a process / container isolation based system should be completely broken, but Linux _is_, and so it becomes a very weak opponent.I really don't think I can agree with the debugging argument here at a conceptual level, either. Issues with debugging unikernels are caused by poor outside-in tooling, but with good outside-in tooling, a unikernel should be _easier_ to debug than a container or OS process, because the VM-owner / hypervisor will often already have a way to inspect the unikernel-machine's entire state from the outside, without additional struggle of trying to maintain, juggle, and restore multiple contexts within a running system. There is essentially an ISP/ICE debugging probe attached to the entire system end to end by default, in the form of the hypervisor.For example, there is no reason a hosting hypervisor could not provide DTrace in a way which is completely transparent to the unikernel guest, and this would be much easier to implement than DTrace self-hosted in a running kernel!If done properly, this way a uni-application basically becomes debugging-agnostic: it doesn't need cooperative tracepoints or self-modifying patches (and all of the state juggling that comes with that, think like Kprobe), because the hypervisor can do the tracing externally. The unikernel does not need to grow (in security surface area, debug-size, blast radius, etc.) to add more trace and debug capability.",

Both ultimately lead to the host OS servicing the request. There isn't any notable difference between the kernel/hypervisor and the user/kernel boundary in modern processors either; most of the time, privilege escalations come from errors in the software running in the privileged modes of the processor.Technically, in the former case, besides exploiting the application, a hypothetical attacker will also have to exploit a flaw in QEMU to start processes or gain further privileges on the host, but that's just due to a layer of indirection. You can accomplish this without resorting to hardware virtualization. Once in QEMU, the entire assortment of your host's system calls and services is exposed, just as if you ran your code as a regular user space process.This is the level you want to block exec() and other functionality your application doesn't need at, so that neither QEMU nor your code ran directly can perform anything out of their scope.

At least, compared to pulling off an exploit in the first place.I would think that merging kernel and user address spaces in a unikernel would, if anything, make it more vulnerable than a design using similar kernel options that did not attempt to merge everything into the kernel. Since now every application exploit is a kernel exploit.",

But in reality probably always in an incomplete or odd way, and now you're using someone's hand crafted set of compatibility libraries instead of a battle tested operating system.I just think we haven't seen the right system, yet, which would probably be some specific application development mostly from the ground up in the context of unikernel, not the other way around.

Further down the article, the author suggests bubbling up the error with a result type, but you can only bubble it up so far before you have to get rid of it one way or another. Unless you bubble everything all the way to the top, but then you've just reinvented unchecked exceptions.At some level, the simplest thing to do is to give up and crash if things are no longer sane.

I \nfinally finished compiling mesa, xorg-server, ffmpeg, mpv, gtk3 + gtk4 -\nand the prior dependencies (llvm etc...). So I am almost finished finally.I had to invest quite a lot of time hunting for dependencies. Most recent\none was glad2 for libplacebo.

The project project at pip website was\nvirtually useless; respectively I installed \"pip install glad\" which was \ntoo old. Also took me perhaps one full minute or more to realise it.I am tapping into LFS and BLFS webpage (Linux from scratch), which helps a\nlot but it is not perfect. So much information is not described and people\nhave to know what they are doing. You can say this is fair, as this is more\nfor advanced users. Ok. The problem is ... so many things that compilers do,\nis not well-described; or at the least you can not easily find high quality\ndocumentation. Google search is almost virtually useless now; AI just hallucinates\nand flat out lies to you often. Or tells you things that are trivia and you already\nknow it. We kind of lose quality here. It's as if everything got dumbed down.Meanwhile more and more software is required to build other software. Take\nmesa. Now I need not only LLVM but also the whole spirv-stack. And shaderc. And\nlots more. And also rust - why is rust suddenly such a huge dependency? Why is\nthere such a proliferation of programming languages? Ok, perhaps C and C++ are\nno longer the best language, but WHY is the whole stack constantly expanding?We worship complexity. The compilers also become bigger and bigger.About two days ago I cloned gcc from https://github.com/gcc-mirror/gcc.\nThe .tar.xz sits at 3.8 GB. Granted, regular tarball releases are much\nsmaller, e. g. 15.1.0 tar.xz at 97MB (at https://ftp.gnu.org/gnu/gcc/?C=M;O=D).\nBut still. These things become bigger and bigger. gcc-7.2.0.tar.xz from 9 years ago had a size of 59M. Almost twice the size now in less than 10 years. And\nthat's really just like all the other software too. We ended up worshipping\nmore and more bloat. Nobody cares about size. Now one can say \"this is just\nstatic code\", but this is expanded and it just keeps on getting bigger. Look\nat LLVM. How to compile this beast: https://www.linuxfromscratch.org/blfs/view/svn/general/llvm.... - and this will\nonly get bigger and bigger and bigger.So, back to the \"are compilers your best friend\"? I am not sure. We seem to \nhave the problem of more and more complexity getting in at the same time. And\neveryone seems to think this is no issue. I believe there are issues. Take\nslackware; basically it was a one person maintains it. This may not be the\nprimary reason, but slackware slowed down a lot in the last some years.

My typical setup is this:1. Make a list of invariants. (Eg if Foo is set, bar + zot must be less than 10)2. Make a check() function which validates all the invariants you can think of. It’s ok if this function is slow.3. Make a function which takes in a random seed. It initializes your object and then, in a loop, calls random mutation functions (using a seeded RNG) and then calls check(). 100 iterations is usually a good number.4. Call this in an outer loop, trying lots of seeds.5. If anything fails, print out the failing seed number and crash. This provides a reproducible test so you can go in and figure out what went wrong.If I had a penny for every bug I’ve found doing this, I’d be a rich man. It’s a wildly effective technique.",

It's hard to do this cleanly with procedural programming because where you want to draw the module boundaries (e.g.: so as to separate logic and infrastructure concerns) doesn't line up with the sequential or hierarchical flow of the program. In that case you have to bring in some more powerful tools. Usually it means polymorphism. Depending on your language that might be using interfaces, typeclasses, callbacks, or something more exotic. But you pay for these more powerful tools! They are more complex to set up and harder to understand than simple straightforward procedural code.In many cases judicious splitting of a \"mixed-concern function\" might be enough and that should probably be the first option on the list. But it's a tradeoff. For instance, you then could lose cohesion and invariance properties (a logically singular operation is now in multiple temporally coupled operations), or pay for the extra complexity of all the data types that interface between all the suboperations.To give an example, in \"classic\" object-oriented Domain-Driven Design approaches, you use the Repository pattern. The Repository serves as the interface or hinge point between your business logic and database logic. Now, like I said in the last paragraph, you could instead design it so the business logic returned its desired side-effects to the co-ordinating layer and have it handle dispatching those to the database functions.

Then another function would execute the effects based on the returned flags (kind of like the example you gave of processing a pending charges table).The value of that level of abstraction is less clear though. Maybe better testability? But it's hard to justify what would essentially be tripling the lines of code (one function to pull the data, one pure function to compute actions, one function to execute actions).Additionally, there's a performance cost to pulling all relevant data, instead of being able to progressively filter the data in different ways depending on partial results (example: computing charges for all users at once and then passing it to a pure function that only bills customers whose billing date is today).Would be great to see some more complex examples of \"functional core imperative shell\" to see what it looks like in real-world applications, since I'm guessing the refactoring I have in my head is a naive way to do it.",

In Swift, by defining an Enum, you give those states a name and a purpose. This forces you to handle cases exhaustively and intentionally.

Some people themselves resell OVH servers or white-sell it, they are chill in this mannerI think one of the benefits of OVH is its unlimited egress policy. Upcloud and OVH are the only two which offer something similar I suppose and I think OVH is on the more cheaper side but Upcloud support team did feel phenomenal to me (I wish I was sponsored by them)Pro tip but I have heard from people to talk to OVH through their twitter. I don't use twitter but yeah, also another idea for support could be to join their discord too, I think one of the core people once answered my simple question there (how to run docker in ovh servers/automate it) but they didn't answer some other question regarding the tos of ovh or similar which I can admit could be not sure if we should ask a developer about such things idk but overall all of these are pretty good options to pick!There is just something fun about optimizing about server prices and support and just this grid-like optimization that takes place in your head when you are interested in things like this.",

The simplicity of 21 MB is mind boggling to me. Makes one really wonder what bloat really is I suppose, definitely a fun experience.Oh also I love alpine because I ran it in my phone using UserLand and I loved it although running python in alpine was a bit of mess on my phone and I think I ended up doing some wizard magic or something using g-compat in the end as well to run it.

          "content": "Do note thought that X25519 and Ed25519 were designed so they wouldn’t need those checks at all.  It’s only when you’re trying to design fancier protocols on top of Curve25519 or Edwards25519 that you can run into subgroup issues.And for those use cases, I personally try my best to just reproject everything back into the prime order subgroup whenever possible.  Monocypher has a number of such fancy functions:  crypto_x25519_dirty_fast()\n  crypto_x25519_dirty_small()\n  crypto_elligator_map()\n  crypto_elligator_rev()\n  crypto_elligator_key_pair()\n\nThe dirty functions explicitly produce public keys that cover the entire curve, so that random such keys are truly indistinguishable from random when converted with `crypto_elligator_rev()`.  But instead of just removing the clamp operation, I instead add random low-order point, so that when we later use the point in an X25519 key exchange, the shared secret is exactly the same as it would have been for a genuine X255119 key.That’s where I thank DJB for designing a key exchange protocol that project the shared secret to the prime order subgroup, even when the public key it processes is not.  The original intent may have been to make checks easier (low order keys all end up yielding zero), but a nice side effect is how it enabled a nice API for Mike Hamburg’s Elligator2.> Accepting points outside the prime-order subgroup can quietly undermine higher-level assumptions, even if no immediate exploit is obvious.If on the other hand we can prove that all computed results are low-order-component-independent (as is the case for X25519), then we know for sure we’re safe.  In the end, Ristretto is only really needed when we can’t tweak the protocol to safely reproject to the prime order subgroup.Don’t get me wrong, having a prime order group abstraction does help.  But if someone is qualified to design a protocol that may require this, they’re qualified to try and make it work with a non-trivial cofactor as well — that, or prove it cannot be done.",

(in particular, the FCC limited the total signal power, which means not all 64000 combinations of bits in a second of audio would be allowable)I worked with modem modulation folks when I was a co-op student in the mid-80s. They had spent their lives thinking about the world in terms of analog channels, and it took some serious out-of-the-box thinking on someone's part to realize that the channel was no longer analog, and that you could take advantage of that.A few years later those same folks all ended up working on cable modems, and it was back to the purely analog world again.",

The telco uses digital internally (remember you and your ISP probably aren't at the same exchange), which puts a hard limit on data rate - there is no trick you can do to get more bits through than the bits used in the digital part of the call.If you (as the ISP) buy enough lines you can get them delivered in digital format. A T1 is designed to carry 24 simultaneous phone calls, acting virtually as a bundle of 24 analog phone cables. So the obvious next stage was to have a modem that can handle 24 simultaneous connections on one cable.Now you have ISP\\_modem←Ax24→ISP\\_muxer←Dx24→Telco←→Telco←A→UserThe ISP's modem generates analog signals for up to 24 simultaneous incoming calls, and they pass into a multiplexer that connects 24 analog lines to a T1 line and they go through the telco digitally to users. The maximum bandwidth is still as before - the modem has to generate an analog signal that will still be receivable at the other end after A2D and D2A conversion. Even though the digital bandwidth for the digital part is 56kbps, the maximum achievable bandwidth through this digital-bottlenecked analog call was found to be 33.6kbps.But the industry had an idea: by convincing the telco to install the modems into the user's exchange, the analog portion would only be between the telco and the user, without a digital segment in the middle of it, and therefore wouldn't be bottlenecked the same way. The same digital backhaul from the ISP through the telco was used, but instead of transmitting a digitised analog modem signal and therefore causing degradation of quality, it transmitted your actual internet traffic bits, up to 56kbps. The analog signal was made at the user's side of the telco and didn't have to fit within 56kbps when digitised.Pedantically, the digital circuits are 64kbps but one bit in some bytes is used for call status signaling, which is okay for voice, but the ISP equipment can't predict which bytes have a bit overwritten (and it could be multiple if there are several hops) so it just used 7 bits in each byte.",

One fact of note was that the the team responsible for spacecraft navigation had already observed anomalous trajectory data but their reports were ignored because they didn't follow program guidelines for filling out the paperwork to document the observations, so the insertion burn went ahead heedless of what the spacecraft's behavior was trying to tell them.Ultimately, the loss of mission was a result of unclear responsibility for ownership of the orbital maneuvering software, including the mission requirements that traced to the software, the development of the software derived from those requirements, tests to validate the software, and reports from users of the software that it was behaving unexpectedly.I was trying to be funny, and turned the statement around from \"clear lines of responsibility\" to \"clear lines of blame\".",

He later moved to California to attend college, graduating from the University of Southern California in 1960 with degrees in Mathematics and Psychology. He went on to earn his law degree from Harvard Law School.In 1967, Stewart met his future wife, Peta Kennedy, while the two were working at CBS News in Paris. They returned to the United States and married later that year. Stewart's career in television production took them around the world, and they lived together in the Samoan Islands, Hawaii, San Francisco, and Los Angeles, before eventually settling back in Philadelphia.Stewart and Peta had two children, Stephanie and Jonathan.Stewart is best known for producing and hosting the nationally broadcast PBS television programs Computer Chronicles and Net Cafe. Computer Chronicles aired from 1984 to 2002, producing more than 400 episodes that documented the rise of the personal computer from its earliest days. Net Cafe, which aired from 1996 to 2002, explored the emergence of the internet. Both programs were widely regarded as visionary, capturing the evolution of personal computing and the early development of the digital age.Stewart's professional interests and talents were wide-ranging. After leaving television production, he worked as a consultant for the Internet Archive, helping to preserve and provide public access to cultural and technological media, including Computer Chronicles and other technology programs. He also shared his knowledge as an educator, teaching broadcast journalism at the Donald W. Reynolds School of Journalism at the University of Nevada, Reno. After retirement, he spent his remaining years enjoying time with Peta, his children, his grandchildren, and his brothers.Stewart is survived by his brothers Lanny and Bruce, his children Stephanie and Jonathan, and his grandchildren Gussy, Josephine, Benjamin, Freya, and Penny.Services will be held for immediate family only.",

      "abstract": "该讨论围绕大英帝国海底电报网络的遗产展开。核心话题是这一历史通信系统在技术、社会及地缘政治方面的影响。有人认为电报网络堪称“维多利亚时代的互联网”，它不仅推动了技术革新，还迫使人们重新理解信息传递与时空概念。也有用户指出，电报对全球金融（如“cable”成为货币对代号）和时钟同步产生了深远影响，并催生了像澳大利亚爱丽斯泉这样的中转站定居点。讨论中提到，部分用户分享了相关书籍、纪录片和遗迹信息，以说明历史技术常被当代人忽视其革命性。分歧点在于对网络韧性的质疑，有用户指出现有地图与原文所述的可靠性声称不符。普遍共识是，这一网络在19世纪末被视为近乎魔法的技术，极大地缩短了全球通信距离，其历史意义值得深入探讨。",

Vulcanized rubber was the other option but performed poorly in cables and was harder to work with.https://atlantic-cable.com/Article/GuttaPercha/The above is a fascinating and depressing history of the Gutta Percha factory that made all these cables, after joining with the cable company that supplied the actual wires. There's an 1853 travelogue piece embedded here of an author visiting the factory, where he notes in the worst parts of the factory where boiling and heat are applied, it was staffed with boys who barely made more than a dollar a week. By boys I thought it was slang for young men then I realized 1850s England was heavily using child labor.Those cables are the product of child labor, like much of the Victorian age's industrial and textile output. Children often made up significant portions of factory workforces, sometimes 25-50% in certain textile sectors, with many under 14. I wish the stories of child labor were better told and more prominent. This abuse and exploitation of children gets quite whitewashed during this age and its nice to see it acknowledged, albeit briefly.",

Normal read system call gets the data from disk hardware into the kernel page cache and then copies it into the buffer you provide in your process memory. With mmap, the page cache is mapped directly into your process memory, no copy.All running processes share the mapped copy of the file.There are a lot of downsides to mmap: you lose explicit error handling and fine-grained control of when exactly I/O happens.

More?This should be brought to the top and the actual compromises can then be understood, \"we\" can then decide if it's \"better\" for our context. In some cases faster with lossy output is actually better, in others absolutely not. The difference between the new and the old solutions isn't binary and have no visibility on that is what makes such a process nothing more than yet another showcase that LLMs can indeed produce \"something\" that is absolutely boring while consuming a TON of resources, including our own attention.TL;DR: there should be test \"harness\" made by 3rd parties (or from well known software it is the closest too) that an LLM generated piece of code should pass before being actually compared.",

The Zig standard library offers a lot of structures like hash maps, SIMD primitives, and allocators with different performance characteristics to better fit a given use-case. C application code often skips on these things simply because it is a lot more friction to do in C than in Zig.",
