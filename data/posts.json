      "abstract": "该HackerNews帖子讨论了苹果产品中一系列长期存在且令人困扰的软件缺陷。核心话题聚焦于用户在日常使用中频繁遭遇的各种系统错误，涉及macOS的Finder、iOS的自动更正、闹钟功能以及账户验证等多个方面。\n\n社区观点呈现明显分歧。许多用户表达了强烈不满，有人认为Finder的文件管理逻辑混乱，其残留的“空间管理器”特性反而导致操作不便；也有用户指出iOS的自动更正功能过于顽固，甚至在发送信息时强行修改内容，体验极差；讨论中还提到iPhone闹钟响起时屏幕不亮、按电源键反而误触贪睡等具体问题。部分用户对此感到沮丧，表示这些缺陷每周都会浪费其时间，甚至因此考虑转向其他平台。\n\n尽管存在批评，但也有共识。用户普遍认为，鉴于苹果产品的巨大用户基数，修复其中任何一个问题都能产生巨大价值。同时，不少用户希望此次公开讨论能促使苹果公司正视并修复这些长期存在的缺陷。",

You just cant make this sh*t up it's so bad.Example sidebar:Applications - Always shows as iconsDocuments - Shows as icons if you last clicked on Applications. Shows as details if last you clicked on DownloadsDownloads - Always shows as detailsFinder is the absolute worst we could write a book about it. Once a year or so all my sidebar folders randomly vanish and I have to re-add them.Also\nThe most annoying \"it's a feature, not a bug\" - That instant  drop down of the title bar in full screen if the mouse cursor hits the top edge of the screen. So obnoxious with remote desktop sessions. No delay, no way to disable it, no way to change anything about it.",

It was restored from a backup taken on an iPhone X that had two physical SIM slots (Chinese version). The new phone now seems to think it has two physical SIM slots: it shows an IMEI2 in About, but any attempt to use the eSIM functionality just fails (scanning a code does \"nothing\"; no \"add\" button is visible, etc.).If this was an Android phone, I'd root it and just fix the offending network configuration file. I believe it's possible to tamper with a backup of the phone to fix the issue, but this would mean a full backup+restore cycle and some specialized tooling to go mucking with the backup.I filed a Radar on it ages ago, but I'm assuming nobody ever picked it up.",

At other times, it’s a big joke on “it just works”.Text selection and the trials to just move the cursor quickly and accurately: it’s like Apple has no senior management that cares enough (looking at you, Craig Federighi), no QA (this is obvious truth to every user) and no money to spend on making things better (don’t let the stock prices fool you).

It never came. There was an email alternative, but that also didn't work properly (maybe only on certain devices, IIRC?). Apparently in the settings you can request a 2FA code, though, so I did that... but that only had five digits, whereas I needed to give six for the code to work. Eventually I figured out that Apple had just forgotten to zero-pad the 2FA code out to six digits, so I needed to add a leading zero to make things work.The worst part of this is that now my Apple TV account is linked to a laptop that I don't always have on me. And even if I did have it on me, I don't want to get a laptop out and turn it on just to do 2FA. I already have a TOTP app on my phone, just let me put everything in there and leave me be.My experience with MacOS is generally that it's about as buggy as my home Linux setup.

You repeat, again a trifling piece gets unselected, but this time the partial selection remains in tact after the highlight popup prompt is dismissed, and you try to expand the selection, but it either doesn’t react or cancels the entire selection, just for fun.It can take a few times to get the selection right, but by that time you forgot why you wanted to highlight that passage in the first place.It totally breaks my flow of consciousness while reading and marking.It happens on iPhones and iPads, with and without the Pencil.",

The sanctions were introduced after the court issued an arrest warrant for Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu.The concrete consequences of the sanctions extend far beyond a travel ban to the US. \"The sanctions affect all aspects of my daily life. They prohibit all US individuals or legal entities, all persons or companies, including their foreign subsidiaries, from providing me with services\", Guillou explains.All his accounts with US companies such as Amazon, Airbnb, PayPal, and others have been closed. \"For example, I booked a hotel in France through Expedia, and a few hours later, the company sent an email canceling the reservation citing the sanctions. In practice, you can no longer shop online because you don't know if the packaging your product comes in is American. Being under sanctions is like being sent back to the 1990s\", he says.\"Overnight, you find yourself without a bank card, and these companies have an almost complete monopoly, at least in Europe. US companies are actively involved in intimidating sanctioned individuals – in this case, the judges and prosecutors who administer justice in contemporary armed conflicts\", he notes.He emphasizes that sanctions can last for more than a decade or even longer.https://nordictimes.com/world/how-french-icc-judge-faces-us-...",

          "content": "> However, that compatibility also weakens its own copyleftKeep in mind that within EU the GPL's copyleft is as strong as EUPL's or LGPL while at the same time EUPL takes into account network access like AGPL. In practice though, software is distributed outside of the EU and while GPL relies on local laws to \"maximize\" its copyleftness, EUPL specifically refers to either the EU country of the developer or Belgium if the developers from outside the EU, where the laws do not distinguish between static or dynamic linking (check \"More details on the case of linking\" from [0] about license compatibility). Also FWIW while FSF suggests that \"license hopping\" (i.e. changing to some compatible licenses from EUPL to something else) weakens the copyleft, a European Commision lawyer who worked on EUPL has commented doing so would be copyright infringement because the purpose of the compatibility list in EUPL is for interoperability (so that multiple projects with different licenses can coexist) and the purpose would matter in court.Though in practice since software is often distributed outside of EU, e.g. to US where (it seems) such distinction does exist, people do respect (L)GPL's dynamic vs static linking requirements and from a worldwide perspective EUPL is something like LGPL with a dash of AGPL (making some program functionality available even remotely is considered as distribution). Or in other words, EUPL is basically AGPL within the limitations of EU law.[0] https://interoperable-europe.ec.europa.eu/collection/eupl/li...",

It compares the callers prompt with the proposed callee's prompt to determine if we are making a reasonable effort to reduce the problem into workable base cases. If the two prompts are identical we deny the request with an explanation. In practice, this works so well I can allow for unlimited depth and have zero fear of blowing the stack.

Then Claude Code steamrolled everyone; they win because they can do RL on the whole agentic scaffold.Any multi-agent system will have the same properties, i.e. whatever traits (e.g. the GUPP) and tool expertise (e.g. using Beads) are required to effectively participate in a swarm will get RL'd into the coding model, and any attempts to build alternate scaffolds will hit impedance mismatches because they do not fit the shape of what was RL'd (just like using non-CC UIs with Anthropic models gives you worse results than using the CC UI).I say this with love - Yegge is putting forth some excellent ideas here. Beads seems like a great concept to add to CC ASAP; storing the TODO state in a repo would mean we don't need MCPs onto issue trackers.

It seems quite good at the basic task of writing working code, but it sucks at architecture and you need occasional code review rounds to keep the codebase tidy and readable.

I wonder if this has to do with eBay's search ranking algorithm or some other irrational behavior that I don't understand. At any rate, bidding with 5 or less seconds left to go seems to defeat the above behaviors.

This is a marked difference from the expectation that, like a real-world in-person auction, the extending deadline might encourage further spur-of-the-moment bidding.Whether it makes much difference to the final price or not is immaterial though if the buyers believe that it does. This is one of the (several) reasons why eBay won out against similar competition in the early days: buyers felt they were getting a better deal by being able to snipe so favoured eBay with more of their attention and this brought more sellers to the platform (which attracted more buyers, and so on round the loop). It is telling that to deal with the extra load imposed on the system by external bots refreshing pages and putting in automated bids, instead of switching to an extending auction model they implemented what is almost a built-in sniping feature.Auction sites have to be very careful (or just very lucky) in their messaging, to convince both sellers and buyers that they are getting a good deal - any major change to how eBay works could upset the balance that they currently have in that regard and start a flood in the other direction (the more people leave, the more other people will think about leaving) to the building toward critical mass that was how they won out in those early days.",

Since this was an automated system, you could beat any human to take advantage of the deal.I made a ton of in game currency doing this.After a few months they changed the auction rules to prevent this… add-ons could no longer directly bid on items, and you had to sit there and click “buy” whenever the script found a good deal.

If the nibbler thought he could get the item for 30€, you would only have to pay 30.50€ to beat him.

It does, in fact, work much better. There is still an advantage to bidding very late: there is no disadvantage, and it lowers bids in cases of irrational or imperfect opposing bidders.

Meaning that they just wipe away all of their potential bargain and get it for their valuation. Leaves a sour taste; feels like they're bidding against themselves.As somebody who auctions things, I use a required greater than \"≈10%\" of the current bid amount bid increment, and the auction doesn't end on an item until there hasn't been a bid for 10 minutes. Works great. \"≈10%\" means to just drop the last digit of the current bid to know the minimum next bid.

However, in my opinion some changes still need to be made, particularly for machines without hardware acceleration support:- Let users opt out of storing recovery keys online during setup.- Let users choose between TPM or password based FDE during setup and let them switch between those options without forcing them to deal with group policies and the CLI.- Change the KDF to a memory-hard KDF - this is important for both password and PIN protected FDE. It's 2026 - we shouldn't be spamming SHA256 anymore.- Remove the 20 char limit from PIN protectors and make them alphanumerical by default. Windows 11 requires TPM 2.0 anyway so there's no point in enforcing a 20 char limit.- Enable TPM parameter encryption for the same reasons outlined above.",

I don't think it's a secret. The whole schtick is that you get to manage windows computers in a corporate fleet remotely, that includes being able to lock-out or unlock volumes. The only other way to do that would be for the person using the device to store the keys somewhere locally, but the whole point is you don't trust the people using the computers, they're employees. If they get fired, or if they lose the laptop, them being the only people who can unlock the bitlocker volume is a very bad situation.

Seth is the one researching the suppliers \"with the help of\" Claude. Seth is presumably the one deciding when to prompt Claude to make decisions about if they should plant in Iowa in how many days. I think I could also grow corn if someone came and asked me well defined questions and then acted on what I said. I might even be better at it because unlike a Claude output I will still be conscious in 30 seconds.That is a far cry from sitting down at a command like and saying \"Do everything necessary to grow 500 bushels of corn by October\".",

(I live the next county over, but I bike to Polk county all the time)  This is not a good location to run this because the farm land is owned by farmer/investors or farmer/developers - either way everybody knows the farm will become a suburb in the next 20 years and has priced accordingly (and if the timeline is is less than 5 years they have switched to mining mode - strip out the last fertility before the development destroys the land anyway). Which is to say you can get much better land deals elsewhere (and by making your search wider) - sometimes the price might be higher but that is because the land/soil is better.Overall I don't think this is useful. They might or might not get good results. However it is really hard to beat the farmer/laborer who lives close to the farm and thus sees things happen and can react quickly.  There is also great value in knowing your land, though they should get records of what has happened in the past (this is all in a computer, but you won't always get access to it when you buy/lease land). Farmers are already using computers to guide decisions.My prediction: they lose money.  Not because the AI does stupid things (though that might happen), but because last year harvests were really good and so supply and demand means many farms will lose money no matter what you do.  But if the weather is just right he could make a lot of money when other farmers have a really bad harvest (that is he has a large harvest but everyone else has a terrible harvest).Iowa has strong farm ownership laws. There is real risk he will get shutdown somehow because what he is doing is somehow illegal. I'm not sure what the laws are, check with a real lawyer.

The tractors themselves do most of the driving themselves if you choose to get those packages added. You can get services that monitor storm damage and predict losses on your fields, and updated satellite feed information on growth patterns, soil moisture, vegetation loss, and more. Simply put super high automation is already available for farming. I tell my uncle his job is to make sure the tractor has diesel in it, and that nothing is jammed in the plow.When it comes to animal farming in the mid-west, a huge portion of it is done by contracts with other companies. My uncle owns the land and provides the labor, but the buildings, birds, food, and any other supplies. A faceless company setting up the contract like now, or an AI sending the same paperwork really may not look too much different.",

If you are building a feature that’s similar to something you built before, then it’s very possible to give accurate estimates to, say, p80 or p90 granularity.You just need to recognize that there is always some possibility of uncovering a bug or dependency issue or infra problem that delays you, and this uncertainty compounds over longer time horizon.The author even gestures in this direction:> sometimes you can accurately estimate software work, when that work is very well-understood and very small in scope. For instance, if I know it takes half an hour to deploy a serviceSo really what we should take from this is that the author is capable of estimating hours-long tasks reliably. theptip reports being able to reliably estimate weeks-long tasks. And theptip has worked with rare engineers who can somehow, magically, deliver an Eng-year of effort across multiple team members within 10% of budget.So rather than claim it’s impossible, perhaps a better claim is that it’s a very hard skill, and pretty rare?(IMO also it requires quite a lot of time investment, and that’s not always valuable, eg startups usually aren’t willing to implement the heavyweight process/rituals required to be accurate.)",

In a functioning org, there are lot of professionals depending on correct estimation to do their job.For us, an accurate delivery date on a 6 month project was mandatory. CX needed it so they could start onboarding high priority customers. Marketing needed it so they could plan advertising collateral and make promises at conventions. Product needed it to understand what the Q3 roadmap should contain. Sales needed it to close deals. I was fortunate to work in a business where I respected the heads of these departments, which believe it or not, should be the norm.The challenge wasn't estimation - it's quite doable to break a large project down into a series of sprints (basically a sprint / waterfall hybrid). Delays usually came from unexpected sources, like reacting to a must have interruption or critical bugs. Those you cannot estimate for, but you can collaborate on a solution. Trim features, push date, bring in extra help, or crunch. Whatever the decision, making sure to work with the other departments as colaborators was always beneficial.",

I've seen teams compare their estimates against their capacity, report that they can't do all this work; priorities and expected timelines don't change. Teams find a way to deliver through some combination of cutting scope or cutting corners.The results are consistent with the author's estimation process - what's delivered is sized to fit the deadline.

Someone says \"3 points\", and someone points out they haven't thought about how it will require X, Y, and Z. Someone else says \"40 points\" and they're asked to explain and it turns out they misunderstood the feature entirely. After somewhere from 2 to 20 minutes, everyone has tried to think about all the gotchas and all the ways it might be done more easily, and you come up with an estimate. History tells you how many points you usually deliver per sprint, and after a few months the team usually gets pretty accurate to within +/- 10% or so, since underestimation on one story gets balanced by overestimation on another.It's not magic. It prevents you from estimating things longer than a sprint, because it assumes that's impossible. But it does ensure that you're constantly delivering value at a steady pace, and that you revisit the cost/benefit tradeoff of each new piece of work at every sprint, so you're not blindsided by everything being 10x or 20x slower than expected after 3 or 6 months.",

          "content": "This is clever advice, to first find out what estimate is tolerable to management and then adapt your design to fit. It's sort of like what the makers of Basecamp, in their book Getting Real, say in chapter 7, \"Fix Time and Budget, Flex Scope\"<https://basecamp.com/gettingreal/02.4-fix-time-and-budget-fl...>.I wonder if it was a mistake to ever call it \"engineering\", because that leads people to think that software engineering is akin to mechanical or civil engineering, where you hire one expensive architect to do the design, and then hand off the grunt work to lower-paid programmers to bang out the code in a repetitive and predictable timeline with no more hard thinking needed. I think that Jack Reeves was right when he said, in 1992, that every line of code is architecture. The grunt work of building it afterward is the job of the compiler and linker. Therefore every time you write code, you are still working on the blueprint. \"What is Software Design?\"<https://www.bleading-edge.com/Publications/C++Journal/Cpjour...>Martin Fowler cites this in his 2005 essay about agile programming, \"The New Methodology\"<https://www.martinfowler.com/articles/newMethodology.html>. Jeff Atwood, also in 2005, explains why software is so different from engineering physical objects, because the laws of physics constrain houses and bridges and aircraft. \"Bridges, Software Engineering, and God\"<https://blog.codinghorror.com/bridges-software-engineering-a...>. All this explains not only why estimates are so hard but also why two programs can do the same thing but one is a thousand lines of code and one is a million.I came into programming from a liberal arts background, specifically writing, not science or math. I see a lot of similarities between programming and writing. Both let you say the same thing an infinite number of ways. I think I benefitted more from Strunk and White's advice to \"omit needless words\" than I might have from a course in how to build city hall.",

PERT-estimates are even three-point estimates of work (best case, expected case, worst case), so you model the uncertainty explicitly rather than by some alchemist formula (\"double and add 20%\").Incidentally, I found out empirically that the best technical people tend to be the worst at estimating their own time needed to complete a task. That's because the best are often also a bit over-confident, perhaps. Letting each team member estimate a task and adding a 20% correction for unforseen issues has worked well to make my projects be delivered on time.Tip: Push back if management tells you how long you have; either explain to them what you can give to them in the time they dictate or reject their task order and say you will come back when you have calculated how long the project takes, which can only be rationally determined once the scope is clear(er).Check out/google: PMI PMP methodology and also PMBOK (project management body of knowledge) > \"Organizational Process Assets\" (OPAs) > \"Lessons Learned Repository\"",

It doesn't matter if it's 2 days work for a senior engineer or 4 days for junior devs, it's still the same number of points, e.g. 8 points. This is intentional. Skill is accounted for in the fact that a team of all senior devs might deliver 200 points a sprint, whereas if half the senior devs got replaced with junior devs the team might only deliver 100. This is intentional, so that estimation is about the team, not any person.And yes, when there's a task that one person happens to know most, people will often defer to them. But that in itself is educational, as the experienced dev explains why the given task is easy/hard. And every task is different, so the person you're deferring to will be different, and you still often get the two or three people who know the task best disagreeing until they hash it out, etc. And very often it's another person who can point out \"well it would be that easy except three sprints ago I did x and so you'll now need to do y...\". And of course plenty of tasks really are brand-new so everyone's figuring it out together.If you're really not having actual discussions around complexity in planning poker, then the facilitator/lead/manager might be doing it wrong. You do have to create an environment where people are expected to speak up and disagree, to demonstrate that this is welcomed and expected and rewarded, and not just some kind of checkbox exercise where the most senior dev gives their estimation and everyone agrees. This is also a reason why it's literally done with cards where everyone is forced to put their number on the table at the same time, so that you don't wind up with some senior person always going first and then everyone else just nodding and agreeing.",

It was mostly ignored, and at first I was surprised.  A multi million dollar organization of people making negative EV plays, which I chalked up to the political pressures being more important than the wastage.  More on that later.As far as estimates go, I've also struggled with the industries cult(ural) rituals.  I tried to put forward a Gaussian based approach that took into account not only the estimate of time, but the expected uncertainty, which is still probably off the mark, but at least attempts to measure some of the variance.  But again, the politics and the rigidity of the clergy that has built around software development blocked it.On the bright side, all this has helped me in my own development and when I think about software development and estimating projects.  I know that outcomes become more chaotic as the number of pieces and steps compound in a project (i.e. the projects normal curve widens).  You may not even get the project at all as defined at the outset, so my normals approach is still not quite the right tool.I think this kind of thinking can be helpful when working solo or in a small group who are exposed to market forces.  But for solo and small groups, the challenge isn't so much about the estimates, it's about how you're going to fight a battalion of mercenaries hired by big VC money and Big Tech.  They can often afford to be inefficient, dump in the market, because their strategy is built around market control.  These aren't practices small players can afford, so you need to get creative, and try to avoid these market participant kill boxes.  And this is why, coming back to my earlier point, that often times, inefficient practices and politics plays a big role.  Their trying to marshal a large number of troops into position and can afford to lose a few battles in order to win the war.

          "content": "Worth knowing in this context:Telephones only want a twisted pair. Ethernet, popular with businesses for decades, also wants a twisted pair. Now, that pair must meet much stricter criteria to be suitable, such as Category 5 (for 100Mbit) or Category 5e (1000Mbit ie Gigabit) - but it really is just twisted pair cable, merely a tighter specification than your phone.Suppose you are a sparky (electrician) and you have some jobs where you are to install telephone connections, some where you put in \"Ethernet\" (presumably 100baseT would be fine) and some they specifically want you to wire for Gigabit.You could go to your wholesaler and buy a reel of Cat3 phone cable, a reel of Cat5 100baseT Ethernet, and a third reel of Cat 5e Gigabit cable, and take the right one for each job. So long as you do this flawlessly you can probably save a few pounds every year by using a slightly cheaper cable for some jobs.Or, you can buy one reel of Cat5e and use that for all these jobs and since it's the same reel you can't have the wrong one and don't need to check paperwork to know you've put the correct cable in a duct etc. Thought that was a phone line but now the client insists it's data? No problem, they're the exact same cable, just smile and agree.When I bought the place where I live now I wanted GigE to this desk, even though the DSL comes into a different room. I didn't love the idea of cutting holes in walls but I was resigned to maybe needing that, except there's a phone extension in this room (like the author says, we do love phone extensions) and so that room the DSL comes into has a twisted pair to here. I opened up the box, and I'm like huh, that's Cat5e, and sure enough this entire building was wired with Cat5e because like I said, why not, it's basically the same cable, why carry a separate reel?So I changed the face plates from telephone to Ethernet, and I'm done.",

It can do 1gbps with a RJ45 connection, just replace the plug and connect tou your device to check, yo ucan get a cheap ethernet cable tester too. If it has just 3 pairs, it can probably do 100mbs automatically with most ethernet capable devices.\n- If you just need to connect 2 devices, you may probably just use existing cables to do it. More than 2 devices would not work.\n- If it doesn't work, all those cables probably go to a box, find it and check if they are connected, if not yo ucan just crimp the ends together.Other alternatives:\n- As others mentioned, MoCA devices are also able to deliver 1gbps, and there is a higher chance that you may find them in most rooms, and they are almost always connected, so it shoudl be plug&play.\n- Powerline adapters novadays not too bad as well. I was able to use them in a 30 eyar old home, 3 floors up to provide 500mbs.",

TFA doesn't mention it but it is possible (although hacky) to gang up two four conductor phone wires into an 8 wire Ethernet run. It's a hack because those phone wires aren't even shielded as well as basic Cat5 but it can still work for relatively short runs. With more people using mobile phones, wireless phones or IP phones instead of POTS, that's leaving increasing amounts of in-wall RJ11 dormant.

Its a lot of heavy equipment and a lot of dudes to operate it all.The good news is if they're already down the road they'll come by and bore for like $20/foot because its a small job (usually they only charge $10/foot for long runs)Permitting depends a lot on where you live, some places treat it as a cash cow and they will brutally milk you, others don't require a permit at all.  The equipment takes up a fair amount of space on each side, probably more than you'd expect.  Scheduling is like dealing with an arborist.  \"OMG I need this partially collapsed tree removed immediately its an emergency I have homeowners insurance please arrive in the next hour\" well thats multiple kilobucks \"Meh please remove this tree sometime and I don't care when\" well thats like $250, probably less if cash.I've seen people spend thousands of dollars on DB or crazy laser/wireless comm gear to avoid spending hundreds of dollars on a stone mason.  Try not to pay someone to DB under a stone wall, its usually cheaper to hire a stone mason twice and he will leave the wall in better condition than before you started.  All masonry is temporary unless its maintained.  Similar logic might apply to driveways, most concrete cracks so if you're hiring a guy to fix the crack you may want to bury a conduit before he fixes it.  Replacing an entire driveway is expensive, replacing a sidewalk sized path is surprisingly cheap.  If you want sidewalk poured (like for a walkway in your garden or around a swimming pool) its about $50/foot and a driveway would have to be thicker and better prepped, but the section could be narrower than a sidewalk.

It wasn't even a cost thing, as the difference was negligible. It was just practical reality. None of the runs are very long and I should be able to get up to 10gbps on 6A, although I doubt I'll ever use more than 2.5gbps (only using 1gbps today). One factor is the property is off-grid except for AC, so data is via StarLink anyway and fiber won't ever happen out there. While LEO satellite and terrestrial cellular speeds will increase in coming years, when more than 2.5gpbs is available - it'll almost certainly be priced to maximize B2B profit and we probably wouldn't pay that for a vacation house (because this is the US, not someplace that prices broadband rationally like Korea).",

I was fitting switches which were state of the art at the time (IPv6 experiments), and they didn't have a 100Mbit option because that was legacy, so you'd plug this ancient looking 1980s cable designed for 10baseT into a switch, and in most cases once it's connected the switch and the network card at the far end both go \"Aha link, can I do 1000baseT over this?\" and conclude yeah, Gigabit just works. There is a setting to say \"No, only do 10baseT\" but why set it?

You've got a pretty good chance for it to work on a short run, even with poor cables.The alternatives being discussed ADSL/VDSL/G.hn actually detect the capability of the medium and adjust the transmission rates and frequency to give the maximum possible speed. IMO they are much more advanced technologically and much more interesting. (Ethernet is doing exactly 250 Mbps on one pair, G.hn can do up to 1700 Mbps on the same pair, automatically adjusted, the article is getting 1300 Mbps which is insane!)",

The progress is really good and more importantly, I can follow it. I can read the output, test it, and understand what changed and why. I don't see much upside in swarms. But I do see the downside which is losing the ability to keep the whole system in my head. The codebase starts growing in directions I didn't choose and it seems decisions will get made I didn't review. Early AI autocomplete that could finish a function already felt like a big productivity win and then AI that could write whole files was an even bigger jump. Like pretty massive. Running one agent at a time, watching what it does, and vetting the output still works well for me and still feels like a strong multiplier. But now there's so much more ceremony: AGENTS.md, SKILLS.md, delegation frameworks. I guess I'm not convinced that leads to better outcomes but I'm probably missing something.

This workflow allows for more effective independent work without context management issues (if you have subagents, there is also an issue with how the progress of the task is communicated by introducing things like task board, it is possible to manage this state outside of context).

Claude is a lot more ... fun/personable to work with? Codex is a force of nature.Another important thing I will do is now that launching plans clear context, it's good to get out of planning mode early, hit an underspecified bit, go back into planning mode and say something like \"As you can see the plan was underspecified, what will the next agent actually need to succeed?\" and iterate that way before we actually start making moves.

If a human is not a decision maker in the production of the code, where does responsibility for errors propagate to?I feel like software engineers are taking a lot of license with the idea that if something bad happens, they will just be able to say \"oh the AI did it\" and no personal responsibility or liability will attribute. But if they personally looked at the code and their name is underneath it signing off the merge request acknowledging responsibility for it - we have a very different dynamic.Just like artists have to re-conceptualise the value of what they do around the creative part of the process, software engineers have to rethink what their value proposition is. And I'm seeing a large part of it is, you are going to take responsibility for the AI output. It won't surprise me if after the first few disasters happen, we see liability legislation that mandates human responsibility for AI errors. At that point I feel many of the people all in on agent driven workflows that are explicitly designed to minimise human oversight are going to find themselves with a big problem.My personal approach is I'm building up a tool set that maximises productivity while ensuring human oversight. Not just that it occurs and is easy to do, but that documentation of it is recorded (inherently, in git).It will be interesting to see how this all evolves.",

This hits the perfect \"sweet spot\" of detail with clear \"cartoon\" coloring.I see a lot of criticism here that this isn't \"pixel art\", so maybe there's some better term to use.

Aesthetically and philosophically, what AI does for \"pixel art\" is very off. And once you see the AI you can't really unsee it.But I didn't want to call it a \"SimCity\" map, though that's really the vibe/inspiration I wanted to capture, because that implies a lot of other things, so I used the term \"pixel art\" even though I figured it might get a lot of (valid) pushback...In general, labels and genres are really hard - \"techno\" to a deep head in Berlin is very different than \"techno\" to my cousins. This issue has always been fraught, because context and meaning and technique are all tangled up in these labels which are so important to some but so easily ignored by others. And those questions are even harder in the age of AI where the machine just gobbles up everything.But regardless, it was a fun project! And to me at least it's better to just make cool ambitious things in good faith and understand that art by definition is meaningful and therefore makes people feel things from love to anger to disgust to fascination.",

You are notating what notes to play, when and for how long they play, what instrument plays them, and any modifications to the default sound of that instrument. Is writing sheet music tedious? Sure, it can be, when the speed of notating by hand can't keep up with the speed your brain is thinking through ideas. But being tedious is not mutually exclusive with being creative despite the attempt to explicitly contrast them as such, and the solution to the process of notating your creativity being tedious is not \"randomly generate a bunch of notes and instruments that have little relation with the ones you're thinking of\". This excerpt supposes that generative AI lets you automate the tedious part while keeping \"the quality of your decisions\", but it doesn't keep your decisions, it generates its own \"decisions\" from a broad, high-level prompt and your role is reduced to merely making decisions about whether or not you like the content generated, which is not creativity.",

I mean, technically that's true, and a lot of what I do daily can certainly be considered mundane. But from an outsiders perspective, both mundane and creative tasks may look identical.I play around with image/video gen, using both \"single prompt to generate\" à la nano banana or sora, and also ComfyUI. Though what I create in ComfyUI often pales in comparison to what Nano or Sora can generate given my hardware constraints, I would consider the stuff I make in ComfyUI more creative than what I make from Sora or Nano, mainly because of how I need to orchestrate my comfy ui workflow, loras, knobs, fine tuning, control net, etc, not to mention prompt refinement.I think creativity in art just boils down to the process required to get there, which I think has always been true.

However, for existing code, the introduction of exceptions has implications on all dependent code. If exceptions can be propagated beyond a new project, it also becomes problematic to integrate the new project into existing exception-free code. Because most existing C++ code at Google is not prepared to deal with exceptions, it is comparatively difficult to adopt new code that generates exceptions.Given that Google's existing code is not exception-tolerant, the costs of using exceptions are somewhat greater than the costs in a new project. The conversion process would be slow and error-prone. We don't believe that the available alternatives to exceptions, such as error codes and assertions, introduce a significant burden.Our advice against using exceptions is not predicated on philosophical or moral grounds, but practical ones. Because we'd like to use our open-source projects at Google and it's difficult to do so if those projects use exceptions, we need to advise against exceptions in Google open-source projects as well.

In 2016 if you'd said \"Initializing my Doodad is too expensive, what do I do?\" you might be pointed at the (unsafe) core::mem::uninitialized() which \"initializes\" any variable, such as your Doodad but er, doesn't actually initialize it.But that's a foot gun, there are niche cases where this crazy stunt actually is correct (ZSTs are one), but in general the compiler was in effect licensed to cause absolute mayhem because this isn't a Doodad at all, which isn't what you wanted. So, they did three things:1. Made a new type wrapper for this purpose, MaybeUninit<Doodad> might not be a Doodad yet, so we can initialize it later and until then the compiler won't set everything on fire but it's the same shape as the Doodad.2. Marked core::mem::uninitialized deprecated. If you use it now the compiler warns you that you shouldn't do that.3. De-fanged it by, despite its name, scrawling the bit pattern 0x01 over all the memory. The compiler can see this has some particular value and for common types it's even valid, a bool will be true, a NonZeroU32 will be 1, and so on. This is slow and probably not what you intended, but we did warn you that it was a bad idea to call this function still so...",

Shorter lunches, clock in 5 minutes early, etc” speech to the base employees, they will absolutely feel resentment and do LESS work, not more.For more than one reason.A quite small few will be pushed over the edge and spend their energy trying to find a new position altogether. But the impact of losing them and having an open position for months will have a huge impact. The impact of losing even a below average worker is nearly always underestimated by uppers who see their 200+ indirects as just numbers on an HR chart. And the employees who hop jobs over bad management are usually in the top half of performance, not bottom.Another handful of over-achievers will realize that their “extra mile” approach is clearly being ignored or not having any effect, and simply become achievers. This alone can have an impact that outweighs any potential gain from whip cracking.The one thing that nearly all employees will do when this happens though: talk to each other and bitch about it. This will tank morale yes, but it more literally just takes a bunch of time and energy. A very large distraction from the actual work.I’ve seen this now at several jobs in a few fields. The negative impact is so much larger than I ever would have guessed starting out.If you want to get more work out of the same workers, you cannot use negative reinforcement. It will backfire.

          "content": "This article hits close to home. Recently management provided some 'training' for everybody at where i work, specially focused at team leaders/supervisors, about being courteous based on a training that Disney offers around the world. The focus was not only to be courteous to your end-users, but also to those who you manage and are on your team.I'm really good at my job, and a few years ago i became a supervisor. But not because i was good with people, simply because i am technically competent. My company was (and still is) rather small (less than 20 on the technical side, but almost 200 overall) and there was no one else remotely apt for the job. I was always a 'cold' person, didn't care much about closeness at work, didn't cared about birthdays, company parties (people absolutely love those where i work, and the company spends a good money on it), and i had to make an effort to remind myself to say 'Good morning' to everybody, because it didn't felt necessary. While i treated everybody with the same respect i wished for myself, eventually i found that that wasn't enough.\nFast forward a few years i got better at the basics, but I'm still struggling on the people aspect of it. My team's productivity is good and so is mine, everybody receives good pay and they are happy on that aspect. The only reason to why my team may not have fallen apart, is probably because we still closely interact with other people from other teams, who are way better at this.> \"An easy place to start is simply acknowledging what’s important to people outside of their jobs: birthdays, graduations, marriages, a new baby, death of a loved one, or religious observances. Doing so makes them feel valued as human beings, not just human capital.\"For a long time i never considered others would find that important, not at the workplace anyway. When you don't care about that stuff yourself, caring for the sake of work feels fake and people can spot it which may backfire. Is it a case of \"fake it until you make it\", or just brute-force until you get better on it? I admit it is exhausting. I love my work and what i do on the technical side, and i cannot complain about the company or the pay, but i do sometimes regret accepting that offer.",

There are a few names for this, Theory X and Theory Y mainly.And don't be snide and just say that the current economy forces you to work due to wages. A lot of people I know would just create their own creative work if they had all the money in the world. So yeah, I think if you frame a persons job and purpose in the company right, you can trust them to work. This may not work in all industries, but in tech it seems to hold.An example where this is in my experience a good guidance: Someone starts slipping their metrics, whatever those are. Comes in late, is hard to reach remotely. Naturally they should get slapped with the book right? Nah. If you assume they want to work well, the first question should be: Why, what is going on?In a lot of cases, there will be something going on in their private life they are struggling with. If you help them with that, or at least help them navigate work around this, you will end up with a great team member.Like one guy on the team recently had some trouble during the last legs of building a house and needed more flexible time. We could've been strict and told him to punch it and take their entire annual vacation to manage that, even if he just needs to be able to jump away for an hour or two here and there. Instead we made sure to schedule simple work for him and have him work with a higher focus on educating his sidekicks, tracked the total time away and then booked it as 3-4 days at the end. Now it's a fun story in the teams lore they are fond of having navigated that, instead of one guy sulking about having lost all of his vacation in that nonsense.",

          "content": "I hear you on the line of thought that here at work we do work and we keep personal things to ourselves.I also commend you on your concern for doing things that appear fake, because people indeed are good at spotting fakeness. And I bet they appreciate that you are not acting fake, because that’s often refreshing to see, and they probably value what you have to say more as a result, and quite likely respect you considerably because of that.For birthdays, wish the employees a happy birthday. You don’t need to get a cake or throw a party (getting cakes for birthdays stops scaling past 10 employees). But everyone should feel a little bit special on their birthday. If you don’t feel that way on your birthday, or you grew up in a family that didn’t celebrate birthdays (e.g. in a Jehovah’s Witness cult), it can be difficult to understand why it matters. But look at it as a technical challenge: can your manager “database” of people hold a birthday field? And can you trigger a smile and a “happy birthday!” greeting on each employee’s birthday? You probably can. The risk for fakeness is quite low (so don’t get a cake and make a big deal out of it), your effort is very low, but the upside for employees is a higher feeling of you caring about them as a person.Death of a loved one is a really important thing to be aware of. Grief fucks people up and it takes at least a year to come back for it. Grieving employees will need more time and space, and are likely to struggle more. They will come back. And they will stick around more if they felt supported. Offer them to take some time off right away and support them by making sure they can take at least a few days off right away. So if someone tells you of a death of a loved one, you must take note! There’s no good advice to give, so don’t feel pressure to give any advice. Offer condolences and acknowledge that it really sucks (“I’m so sorry for your loss, I can’t imagine how difficult it is right now”). You have to be aware of this as a people manager, because your people.Religious observances? I’m meh on that one. You can try to develop curiosity about it if the employee talks about it. Ask them why is the observance important to them? If they don’t talk about it, I leave it. For winter time, it’s happy holidays, and done with it.Okay, a new baby is another one that’s important because your employee will have reduced sleep or be sleep-deprived and have a whole lot of new worries. Be more forgiving with the schedule, let them leave work ad hoc for baby emergencies. You do that, they are much more likely to make up work on their own time as gratitude. Ask them how they feel they are handling the workload—-is there an opportunity to change the type of tasks they are doing? Maybe they are not in a position to be writing deep design docs while they are sleep-deprived. I don’t know, but you can check in when you do your one-on-ones.Write down their spouse or partner’s names, and write down their children’s names. Keep it in your personal manager file. You probably don’t have people with 5+ children. It’s not a lot. It’s hard to remember. But if the employee feels like they don’t have to say “my son” or “my daughter” or “my wife”, but can just say their names to you and you know who they are, it makes them feel more comfortable and more like a human being. This is another one where it’s hard to be fake—-nobody expects you to remember these things, but it sure feels nicer if you do.Regarding feeling like you have to fake it till you make it, it’s like picking up a new habit. You have to practice. You will get better at it. It’s part of your job as a manager.If you find it exhausting, adopt things incrementally. What’s most exhausting? Why is it exhausting? Is it because it’s on top of everything else you’re already doing for 40 hrs a week?As a manager, you have to care about the people, because they are human beings. It’s a part of your job. You can’t not do your job. If it means you spend less time being technical, so you can spend more time managing people as people and not feel exhausted, then that’s what it means. Push back on your manager to make room to do more people stuff and less technical stuff. You can’t spend 90% of your time being technical and 10% managing, unless you have completely self-directed staff. You’re a person too—-and if you job is to manage, you must make time for it, and if there’s not time for it, then that’s your boss’s problem. If your boss doesn’t think it’s a problem, that’s on you because you haven’t told them.Managing engineers is like herding cats. They won’t respond to lashing. And cats don’t show that they are sick because they don’t want to show weakness. So if you don’t ask about what’s going on in their personal lives, you’ll be blind to how it’s affecting their work. And because ultimately they get paid to do work, it is therefore in your interest (and company’s interest) to not be blind to how their personal life is impacting their work.Going back to “fake it till you make it” or brute-forcing until you get better at it—-what you’re not considering is the additional information you will get or increased personal response/appreciation from your people. It might feel like brute force at first, but consider the very real possibility that it can start feeling like a smart thing to do because of the results.",

          "content": "Thank you for the thoughtful reply and all the tips. Truly appreciated.> I hear you on the line of thought that here at work we do work and we keep personal things to ourselves.For me that is precisely it. It's how i always worked to avoid possible conflicts, but also because i like to focus on the tasks. At least where i work (and have worked for the past decade) people are somehow personal, and i believe that it is good for them since they seem to like it, but they do find it weird when others aren't like that. I guess that's where culture plays a big role.> I also commend you on your concern for doing things that appear fake, because people indeed are good at spotting fakeness. And I bet they appreciate that you are not acting fake, because that’s often refreshing to see, and they probably value what you have to say more as a result, and quite likely respect you considerably because of that.Thanks. Being honest is something i always valued, i really dislike doing things for appearances, and i believe people (including yourself) only grow if you show them the truth. I stopped showing on casual company events/hangouts because i didn't want just to be there as work while not having fun at all. People still expect you to do it tho.> If you don’t feel that way on your birthday, or you grew up in a family that didn’t celebrate birthdays (e.g. in a Jehovah’s Witness cult), it can be difficult to understand why it matters.Also that's spot on. My family was never actually religious (although that was the only church they ever went), as far as i remember, and i never correlated the not caring about birthdays with that. But indeed, i forget my own most of the time. The company do provide simple birthday gifts and even a day off, so that is covered i suppose, people do appreciate it. And it was the day my upper manager handed me over my gift that i got called out, because apparently my reaction to it wasn't \"human enough\" upon receiving a gift, i was so focused in something else that i didn't even thought about a reaction, and took me a second to understand what was the gift for. But the call out was not because of only that.> If you find it exhausting, adopt things incrementally. What’s most exhausting? Why is it exhausting? Is it because it’s on top of everything else you’re already doing for 40 hrs a week?Both in and outside of work i do tech related stuff, that ranges from creating scripts for games as a hobby to finding firmware bugs in devices of popular vendors. My whole drive is to solve problems and create things, and make both my life better and improve what (and who) is around me, and for most of the time is also fun. The whole process of people managing is exhausting because, even as a human, i don't understand how to deal with other humans entirely. It's exhausting because that one aspect of my professional life is something i haven't been able to improve despite years trying, as i feel i would need to be somebody else entirely to have a chance on it. It's a \"unsolvable problem\" that i have to deal day after day, 'punching the nail with my bare hands' as a popular saying goes. I have known lots of engineers who refused management positions because of that same thing, but also a few that accepted because they believed it was a problem they could solve and the offer was too good to pass.> Push back on your manager to make room to do more people stuff and less technical stuff.In that aspect i am at fault. Management does give me a lot of room, despite still having technical tasks, but it's up to me to make my team able to solve the tasks that i would have to otherwise. Failing to manage and delegate tasks results in a pile of tasks that i need to finish anyway.In order to improve my management skills i did many courses, including the Dale Carnegie one (paid by the company). While i don't think those courses are 100% useful, i didn't find them worthless either. You get to see different point of views from people like you, with problems similar to yours, which will make you think different on how you approach them. After those i think i understand the basics, at least in theory, on how to manage people properly but the challenge still in making it natural as to type on a keyboard. You don't look at the keys, you just know where they are and how to do it.",

All the ones that let you go hands free cost a subscription of around $500 a year (Ford BlueCruise, GM SuperCruise). And even those only let you use hands free mode on pre-mapped roads, typically only interstates.Becasue most cars with lane follow still lose lock on the lane when the lines are hard to see (rains, snow, etc) or missing due to exists and other things.Becasue most cars with lane follow fail to keep well when the turn gets too sharp.Comma.ai lets you go completely hands free with no wheel nags. It also works just fine when there are no lane lines or poorly visible lines.  It also supports lane change by signaling, and then nudging the wheel when it's clear to move.There is also an experimental mode which stops and goes at stop signs and stop lights.If the driver monitoring camera in the comma detects you fell asleep or something, it will slow the car down and pull over. All the stock lane keep that I have used in cars, if you fail to nudge the wheel they just disengage and you keep going at full speed in a straight line...Then we delve into OpenPilot forks like SunnyPilot that let you do things like decouple gas/break control from steering control, so you can control the gas/brake yourself and let comma just always steer for you.  Comma can also steer more aggressively in turns than any lane keep I have seen, and when it can't you will see the limit being reached on the little display so you know you will need to help out on that tight curve.Experimental mode isn't the best all the time, and SunnyPilot allows hybrid mode which uses regular mode and dynamically switches to experimental mode for stop signs and stop lights.With SunnyPilot it can even read your car's blind spot monitors to automatically make the lane change hen clear without you having to nudge the wheel.Some have been playing with concepts of auto navigation too where the car will take exits and turn through intersections for you.The comma.ai devices have 10W of compute power and the current driving models only use 1W, so there is room to scale to better models with teh current comma devices. There is also talk of supporting more cameras for side views and external GPUs addons with 100W compute for potential FSD level models.",

So we cannot seek or skip forward/backward if we miss a sentence. the time display on the media player is also minimal. Wish these were a more accessible standardized feature set available on demand and not limited by what the web designer of each site decides.I asked \"Claude on Chrome\" extension to fix the media player to the top. It took 2 attempts  to get it right. (It was using Haiku by default -- may be a larger model was needed for this task). I think there is scope to create a standard library for such client side tweaks to web pages -- sort  of like greasemonkey user scripts but at a slightly higher level of abstraction with natural language prompts.",

Anything that looks like general web search is getting pushed behind enterprise gates.I haven’t seen much discussion about this yet, but for anyone who built a small search product on Programmable Search, this feels like a pretty big shift.Curious if others here are affected or already planning alternatives.UPDATE: I logged into Programmable Search and the message is even more explicit: Full web search via the \"Search the entire web\" feature will be discontinued within the next year.

Use adversarial interop via services like SerpAPI (though Google is already taking legal action there)\n3.

But of course the issue is there isn’t really a right tool for that, as to my knowledge nobody has bothered building a fast DOM-style library for Python.If you approach lxml as what ElementTree was designed as it’s very intuitive: an element is a sequence of sub-elements, with a mapping of attributes. It’s a very straightforward model and works great for data documents, as well as fits great within the langage.

Since almost no new projects are choosing XML nowadays, you don't get an influx of new projects that skip the schema part to ship faster, like you get with JSON.

XSLT was the first purely functional language that enjoyed mass adoption in the industry. (It was also homoiconic, like Lisp, amenable to metaprogramming.) Namespaces were a lifesaver when multiple XML documents from different sources had to be combined. XPath was also quite nice for querying.XML is noisy because of the closing tags, but it also guarantees a level of integrity, and LZ-type compressors, even gzip, are excellent at compacting repeated strings.Importantly, XML is a relatively human-friendly format. It has comments, requires no quoting, no commas between list items, etc.Complexity killed XML. JSON was stupid simple, and thus contained far fewer footguns, which was a very welcome change. It was devised as a serialization format, a bit human-hostile, but mapped ideally to bag-of-named-values structures found in basically any modern language.Now we see XML tools adopted to JSON: JSONSchema, JSONPath, etc. JSON5 (as used in e.g. VSCode) allows for comments, trailing commas and other creature comforts.

Even when we get to the very binding of WSDL, there are way too many variations on SOAP: RPC-Encoded? RPC-Literal? Document-Literal? Wrapped Document-Literal?The problem is part of the same myth many people (like the OP author) have about XML and SOAP: There was \"One True Way™\" from the beginning, XML schemas were always XSD, SOAP always required WSDL service definition and the style was always wrapped document-literal, with everything following WS-I profiles with the rest of the WS-* suite like WS-Security, WS-Trust, etc. Oh, and of course we don't care about having a secure spec and avoiding easy-to-spoof digital signatures and preventing XML bombs.Banking systems are mature and I guess everybody already settled and standardized they way they use soap, so you don't have to get into all this mess (And security? Well, if most banks in the world were OK with mandatory maximum password lengths of 8 characters until recently, they probably never heard about XMLdDsig issues or the billion laughs attack).But you know what also gives you auto-generated code that works perfectly without a hitch, with full schema validation? OpenAPI. Do you prefer RPC style? gRPC and Avro will give you RPC with 5% of the wire bloat that XML does. Message size does matter some times after all.All of the things that you mentioned are not unique to XML and SOAP. Any well-specified system that combines an interchange format, a schema format, an RPC schema format and an RPC transport can do the achieve the same thing. Some standards had all of this settled from day one: I think Cap'n Proto, Avro and Thrift fit this description. Other systems like CORBA or Protocol Buffers missed some of the components or did not have a well-defined standard[1].JSON is often criticized by XML-enthusiasts for not having a built-in schema, but his seems like selective amnesia (or maybe all of these bloggers are zoomers or younger millennials?). When XML was first released, there was nothing. Yes, you could cheat and use DTD[2]. But DTD was hard to use and most programmers eschewed writing XML schemas until XSD and Relax-NG came out. SOAP was also very basic (and lightweight!) when it first came out. XSD and WSDL quickly became the standard way to use SOAP, but it took at least a decade to standardize the WSDL binding style (or was it ever standardized)?\nDoing RPC in JSON now is still as messy as SOAP has been, but if you want RPC instead of REST, you wouldn't be going to JSON in the first place.---[1] IIRC, Protocol Buffers 2 had a rudimentary RPC system which never gained traction outside outside of Google and has been entirely replaced by gRPC after version 3 was released.[2] DTD wasn't really designed for XML, but since XML was a subset of SGML, you could use the SGML DTD. But DTD wasn't a good fit for XML, and it was quickly replaced by XSD (and for a while - Relax-NG) for a reason.",

Also namespaces are super annoying, pretty sure I documented the ughsauce necessary to deal with them somewhere.

Or there's various flavors of markdown which do not give you the semi-mythical semantic web but can be banged out easily enough in vi or whatever and don't require schemas and validation or libraries with far too many security problems and I wouldn't write my documentation (these days) using S-expressions anyhow.This being said there probably are places where something that validates strictly is optimal, maybe financial transactions (EDIFACT and XML are different hells, I guess), at least until some cheeky git points out that data can be leaked by encoding with tabs and spaces between the elements.

The hilarious part is that he doesn't recognize the problem when he gives his example of \"or with attributes\".The other thing, is that the JSON model doesn't just give you a free parser/serializer in JavaScript.  It actually maps to the basic data model of the entire generation of dynamic languages that the Web grew on: perl, Python, JS, PHP and Ruby.  Arrays and maps are the basic way to represent structured data in these languages, and JSON just serializes that.  Which means that getting data in and out of your language is just a single line.The author seems to think that XML maps a proper conceptual model and JSON doesn't, but the model of \"nodes with attributes and content\" is a worse match for structured data than JSON's model of \"arrays and maps of values\".Other than that, it's really a question of how much tooling you want to use.

Have you heard of a single Amazon Prime Original Movie[1]?

But it's effectively the opposite of games, movies and other creative media where you have to trust a single person or small group of people with a vision.

So the Prime Video app has been painful to navigate and use.

Or how search will return a match for just about anything because they will happily sell it to you vs having as a default \"show any free results first because I'm not looking to spend more right now.\"That's a product/vision failure (or just mismatch with what you and I want) not an engineering/engineering culture thing.",

Same with presentation layers, the actual view XML is escaped into one line within one attribute of the metadata file. The \"view\" xml may be thousands of lines but it is escaped into a single like of the export file so any change at all just shows that line as being changed in a diff.

I did like exploring with GraphQL which is totally missing in forgejo.

Even with our setup, we split the build and test phases so that CUDA hardware slots aren't wasted on running compilers. It also lets us test a single build under different environments easily.So, yeah, I can see fighting with the feature spectrum, but you need to restrict yourself in most other cases with that kind of stuff too.

Think about it more like GitHub : Forgejo :: Twitter : Mastodon and possibly Filesharing : BitTorrent :: Software Development : Radicle.With Forgejo, every instance has its own database of user accounts, and controls who may log in or not (and so on). This is not the case with Radicle. Since there is no such authority, user accounts are self-certifying.For repositories, since there is no \"standard location\" like \"the server\", Radicle has developed a way to abstract from the user namespaces of the maintainers of a repo, to a canonical namespace. This is how references are lifted from individuals to a project. Not by having a copy on some particular server with access control. Of course, Radicle also has access control, but it is tied to the self-certifying identities, not to some server.",

This makes it extremely performant for day-to-day work and fully functional offline.Tangled to my understanding is federated in theory but centralized in practice. It relies on \"knots\" (servers that host Git repos) and a central AppView at tangled.sh that aggregates the network. Issues and social artifacts live on Personal Data Servers, not locally.

(Mirroring nixpkgs, for example)- is there a mechanism to control syncs so it can be used on low-bandwidth, unreliable networks, or ad-hoc bluetooth networks?- is offline seeding possible or in the works?- language package managers often can reference a git or github. Would I be able to directly reference my local radicle node and have it manage (or perhaps even discover) the correct repos? (Or maybe this is a different problem and package repos themselves could be decentralized and sovereign)On that last point, I mean that the whole build chain and supply chain can be made sovereign: I see radicle is written in Rust, which means dependencies on Cargo, the Rust toolchain, and so forth.",

          "content": "Thanks for your detailed response.I guess what I mean is that trust is a hard problem, and a lot of solutions to trust involve transmuting a presupposed trust problem into a different trust problem with a slightly different security model.For example: with a centralized service, I assume that a given identity is integral so long as the service is secure. I don't need cryptographic identity for that centralized service, but that assumes I trust the service to be secure.With a distributed service, I need some way to ensure the integrity of identities. One way to do that is to TOFU, i.e. take a claimant identity on face value on first observation and then trust it going forwards. This works well for schemes like SSH, but it doesn't work super well for distributed user networks (because users like to lose their keys, and there's a larger potential surface area for undetectable key substitution).Another solution is a \"web of trust\" architecture, where you take an initial trusted core and transitively extend trust outwards. The problems with this are (1) that trust isn't actually transitive, and (2) it still presupposes a trusted core, which needs to be bootstrapped somehow.A third solution is a traditional PKI, where you have one or more pre-established identity \"authorities\" that sign for end user identities. This is the solution that HTTPS picks, and is arguably the most empirically proven of the decentralized identity schemes. But it's only as decentralized as the authorities themselves are, and there's a meaningful argument to be had about that (particularly in schemes that are smaller than the Web PKI).It sounds like Radicle is going with a mixture of (1) and (2), which is interesting and worth proving out. But my experience is that \"someone's SSH key\" is much less of a stable identity than we'd all like it to be, and schemes that involve delegating trust via unstable identities eventually run into architectural limitations that end users solve by just subverting the scheme itself (i.e. falling back to TOFU).> That aside, how do you know which people to trust when you meet them? And how do you signal trust in those you've met? In Radicle holding stable cryptographic identities doesn't resolve the zero-to-some trust problem but it does resolve the some-to-more trust problem, I can continue trusting once I recognise and know an identity.This is a good example both of how (1) social trust isn't easy to encode in cryptographic claims, and (2) how the transitivity of trust breaks down.In the real world, I trust my barber to cut my hair and my dentist to look at my teeth. But I only trust them for their apposite roles, and my trust in my barber doesn't necessarily mean anything to my friend who doesn't like my haircut.",

There's probably only like 5 stories ever that just keep getting re-written this way.But in non-fiction, academic research and the like, stealing ideas without attribution is a problem, because ideas are the whole point. Nobody reads a research paper for the plot.But in school, and especially with non-fiction, we're so often told to \"just re-word it to make it your own\" which is actually the most insidious form of plagiarism. If I get an idea from you and want to include that in my paper, that's great, but I have to give you credit. Great non-fiction books I've read are riddled with citations and have 100-page bibliographies. The value of the book/paper is (often) in the synthesis of those ideas into something new, with maybe it's own ideas added on top.

          "content": "> It’s also common to find long-running idle queries in PostgreSQL. Configuring timeouts like idle_in_transaction_session_timeout is essential to prevent them from blocking autovacuum.Idle transactions have been a huge footgun at $DAYJOB… our code base is full of “connect, start a transaction, do work, if successful, commit.” It means you’re consuming a connection slot for all work, even while you’re not using the database, and not releasing it until you’re done. We had to bump the Postgres connection limits by an order of magnitude, multiple times, and before you know it Postgres takes up more RAM than anything else just to support the number of connections we need.The problem permeated enough of our (rust) codebase that I had to come up with a compile time check that makes sure you’re not awaiting any async functions while a Postgres connection is in your scope. Using the .await keyword on an async function call, but not passing the pg connection to that function, ends up being a nearly perfect proxy for “doing unrelated work while not releasing a connection”. It worked extremely well, the compiler now just straight up tells us where we’re doing it wrong (in 100+ places in fact.)Actually getting away from that pattern has been the hard part, but we’re almost rid of every place we’re doing it, and I can now run with a 32-connection pool in load testing instead of a 10,000 connection pool and there’s no real slowdowns. (Not that we’d go that low in production but it’s nice to know we can!)Just decreasing the timeout for idle transactions would have probably been the backup option, but some of the code that holds long transactions is very rarely hit, and it would have taken a lot of testing to eliminate all of it if we didn’t have the static check.",

          "content": "Postgres can really scale well vertically (and horizontally for read-only workloads) as the post shows.However, I'm still surprised about the reasons for not sharding. They have been mentioned before, but I haven't seen a substantial rationale.Sharding is almost only analyzed from the perspective of write scaling. But sharding may not only be about write scaling, but a path to reducing blast radius. And this is something that triggers much earlier than write scaling needs (especially given how well Postgres scales vertically and reads).When you shard your database, you end up having N clusters (for HA purposes, each \"shard\" must be a primary-replica(s) cluster itself), each holding 1/Nth of the data.There are certain scenarios which, while unlikely, may hit you: data corruption in the WAL replication stream, a problem during a major upgrade, a situation that requires a whole cluster restore from a backup, you name it. For those cases, the whole cluster may experience notable downtime.If you have a single cluster, 100% of your users experience downtime. If you sharded into N clusters, only 1/Nth of your users experience downtime. For a company servicing 800M users the difference from both scenarios is dramatically different. Even for much much smaller companies.I'm puzzled why this is not perceived as a risk, and if it is not, how it is mitigated.While I wouldn't advocate to shard \"too early\", given that it comes with notable caveats, I believe more and more in sharding your workloads when possible more earlier than later. Way before truly needing it from a write scaling perspective. Because apart from reducing the blast radius, it applies implicitly the principle of \"divide-and-conquer\", and your problems become much more manageable (your number of connections per cluster decreases at will, backup restore times can be a fraction of the time, logical replication can be considered as a true option for replication/upgrades/etc if you keep shards relatively small and many other operational procedures are greatly simplified if now you have much smaller databases, even if you have many more of them).",

So, I simply just used PostgreSQL. My chat app has basic RAG, not ground breaking or anything - but the most important feature I made was ability to add different chat models into one group chat.

I didn't notice a single hint of the volume the Postgres was handling, granted - I'm the only user, but there's always a lot going on - RAG, mostly that requires searching of the database for context before multiple agents send you a response (and respond amongst themselves). Absolutely zero performance degradation.I'm convinced that Postgres is a killer database that doesn't get the attention it deserves over the others (for chat).

So that function that calls that slow external service, also takes a &PgConnection as an argument, because it wants to bump a timestamp in a table somewhere after the call is complete. Which means you need to already have a connection open to even call that function, etc etc.If the codebase is large, and full of that kind of pattern (interleaving db writes with other work), the compiler plugin is nice for (a) giving you a TODO list of all the places you’re doing it wrong, and (b) preventing any new code from doing this while you’re fixing all the existing cases.One idea was to bulk-replace everything so that we pass a reference to the pool itself around, instead of a checked-out connection/transaction, and then we would only use a connection for each query on-demand, but that’s dangerous… some of these functions are doing writes, and you may be relying on transaction rollback behavior if something fails. So if you were doing 3 pieces of “work” with a single db transaction before, and the third one failed, the transaction was getting rolled back for all 3. But if you split that into 3 different short-lived connections, now only the last of the 3 db operations is rolled back. So you can’t just find/replace, you need to go through and consider how to re-order the code so that the database calls happen “logically last”, but are still grouped together into a single transaction as before, to avoid subtle consistency bugs.",

The locks might be short lived (for example, just a catalogue update to add a column), but they are nevertheless heavyweight and both block and are blocked by other work.SELECT or DML operations take a lightweight lock on the table that doesn't block most other work, but it does block these schema changes. While the schema change is waiting to acquire the table lock, all new operations (like new SELECTs, for example) get blocked until the schema change completes.So the following scenario can be pretty disastrous:* Start a long-running SELECT operation on table* Attempt to apply schema change to the table* All new work on the table is blocked until the SELECT completes and the schema change can apply.* Production outageWhat the ChatGPT folks do is set a lock timeout when applying the schema change to make it 'give up' after a few seconds. This works to avoid truly excessive impact (in their case, they may have micro-outages of up to 5s while trying to apply schema), but has problems - firstly, they then need to retry, which may lead to more micro-outages, and secondly there's no guarantee on a system with mixed workload that they will be able to force the change through, and the schema change just ends up getting starved out.A better alternative for most workloads is to build a system that detects what workload is blocking your schema change and kills it, allowing the schema change to go through quickly and unblock all the work behind it. You'd still use a lock timeout with this to be on the safe side, but it shouldn't be necessary in most cases.Side note on transactional DDL - for Postgres systems with high throughput, most people just use autocommit. Table level locks that get taken to perform the schema change get held for the duration of the transaction, and you generally want to really minimize the amount of time you hold them for.",

Some time back I commented on the behaviour: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45758543You could use asynchronous WAL shipping, where the WAL files are uploaded to an object store (S3 / Azure Blob) and the streaming connections are only used to signal the position of WAL head to the replicas. The replicas will then fetch the WAL files from the object store and replay them independently. This is what wall-g does, for a real life example.The tradeoffs when using that mechanism are pretty funky, though. For one, the strategy imposes a hard lower bound to replication delay because even the happy path is now \"primary writes WAL file; primary updates WAL head position; primary uploads WAL file to object store; replica downloads WAL file from object store; replica replays WAL file\". In case of unhappy write bursts the delay can go up significantly. You are also subject to any object store and/or API rate limits. The setup makes replication delays slightly more complex to monitor for, but for a competent engineering team that shouldn't be an issue.But it is rather hilarious (in retrospect only) when an object store performance degdaration takes all your replicas effectively offline and the readers fail over to getting their up-to-date data from the single primary.",

I want to make it so HTTP calls are “purple”, and any function that gets a database connection is “pink”, and make it so purple can call pink but not vice-versa.The rule I ended up with in the lint, is basically “if you have a connection in scope, you can only .await a function if you’re passing said connection to that function” (either by reference or by moving it.) It works with rust’s knowledge of lifetimes and drop semantics, so that if you call txn.commit() (which moves the connection out of scope, marking the storage as dead) you’re now free to do unrelated async calls after that line of code. It’s not perfect though… if you wrap the connection in a struct and hold that in your scope, the lint can’t see that you’re holding a connection.

However, it's very clear that it's absolutely not a priority for the HTML5 working groups, and there's a statement that future features will not necessarily be supported by the XHTML5 variant.* XHTML5 does not have a DTD, so one of the main advantages of XHTML - that you can validate its correctness with pure XML functionality - isn't there.* If you do a 'view source' in Firefox on a completely valid XHTML 1.0/1.1 page, it'll redline the XML declaration like it's something wrong.

Because they can't use the C library directly, they had to use a Rust-to-C binding library, that uses Protobuf for portability reasons. Problem is that it is slow.So what they did is that they wrote their own non-portable but much more optimized Rust-to-C bindings, with the help of a LLM.But had they written their software in C, they wouldn't have needed to do any conversion at all. It means they could have titled the article \"How we lowered the performance penalty of using Rust\".I don't know much about Rust or libpg_query, but they probably could have gone even faster by getting rid of the conversion entirely. It would most likely have involved major adaptations and some unsafe Rust though. Writing a converter has many advantages: portability, convenience, security, etc... but it has a cost, and ultimately, I think it is a big reason why computers are so fast and apps are so slow. Our machines keep copying, converting, serializing and deserializing things.Note: I have nothing against what they did, quite the opposite, I always appreciate those who care about performance, and what they did is reasonable and effective, good job!",

Serialization/deserialization is often a hidden bottleneck, especially in microservices where you're doing it constantly\n2. The default implementation of any library is rarely optimal for your specific use case\n3. Benchmarking before optimization is critical - they identified the actual bottleneck instead of guessingFor anyone dealing with Protobuf performance issues, before rewriting:\n- Use arena allocation to reduce memory allocations\n- Pool your message objects\n- Consider if you actually need all the fields you're serializing\n- Profile the actual hot pathRust FFI has overhead too.

That use case runs in the background, and as such is much less performance critical.pg_query actually initially used a JSON format for the parse output (AST), but we changed that to Protobuf a few major releases ago, because Protobuf makes it easy to have typed bindings in the different languages we support (Ruby, Go, Rust, Python, etc). Alternatives (e.g. using FFI directly) make sense for Rust, but would require a lot of maintained glue code for other languages.All that said, I'm supportive of Lev's effort here, and we'll add some additional functions (see [0]) in the libpg_query library to make using it directly (i.e. via FFI) easier. But I don't see Protobuf going away, because in non-performance critical cases, it is more ergonomic across the different bindings.[0]: https://github.com/pganalyze/libpg_query/pull/321",

You need to know which pointers can be NULL or just plain invalid. You need to know which pointers you get from C code or pass to it along with ownership, and which are just borrowed. It maybe (and often is) unclear from the documentation, so you are going to read a lot of C code, trying to guess what the authors were thinking when writing it. Generating hypotheses about the library behavior (like 'library never does THIS with the pointer') and trying to prove them by finding all the code dealing with the pointer.It can be easy in easy situations, or it can be really tricky and time consuming.

I assume similar things happen regularly in Iran and China. Europe is incredibly late to the game, and doing random experiments in small towns is not even nearly enough. Weaning off government services is also not enough, physical networks have to be prepared for it, commercial services have to follow, and the general populace has to be incentivized to use them. Otherwise, the damage from a blackout will still be unsustainable. It doesn't sound democratic, but this should be treated as a matter of national security.

By the hearing alone, you may spot problems.And it also could involve manual manipulation of things holding the data.I may not have ever worked with lots of switches or cards or big reel-to-reels, but for our family’s first computer we had a Radio Shack cassette player that I could hook to it to load software. It was an ordeal to put in a tape, rewind if necessary and coordinate pressing play on the cassette tape player with the load command I had to enter in to load a program. Those were the days!I could also record and load my own programs from the tapes. Press the record and play buttons at the same time and hit enter on that keyboard!Granted our first computer also had cartridges, but I only had a few for it.It was like Christmas (or literally was Christmas) whenever we got new software from anywhere, whether it was from Radio Shack or a bookstore that had a few or more tapes available.That’s why I started to program. It was fun, and it was the only way to get new software whenever I wanted it. Early on it was entering programs from the manual, but I learned quickly to write my own.When I later got a 5 1/4” floppy drive, it was so awesome, especially once I got an Apple and could trade/copy disks from others, stores, a local college, and the library.Even once we got a modem, you still had put the data somewhere, so it went on floppies.Everything was physical and novel then.

I often see Fastmail recommended too.- Use a standalone email client that allows you to connect to multiple email servers. This makes it easy to continue to monitor your old email account while you use the new one. I use Thunderbird on desktop and FairEmail on Android (though Thunderbird also has an app for Android).- Transfer all of your most important accounts over initially. As long as you continue to have access to your old account, you don't need to transfer absolutely everything all at once, you can do it over time.- Use a custom domain name so if you decide to change providers again in future you just need to update your DNS records rather than changing your email address in all your accounts.- You may also want to set up a catch-all email address or use a service like https://addy.io/ to generate email aliases on the fly, and create a new alias for each service you use (for example, your email for GitHub could be github.com@mydomain.com). This helps protect your actual personal email address from spam.",

So no privacy gains there either.Ya, there's no way of not letting google know what your new address is, but you're going to be emailing a lot of gmail addresses anyway so there's no way around that, really.  But with the forwarding they only know incoming mail.I switched off gmail 3.5 years ago and all I can say is that it wasn't anywhere near as scary as I thought it would be.  I setup an auto-responder that would hound people to update their contacts for me and slowly switched over services I cared about (and closed others!)  An important point, though, is that I don't really care about old emails.  I do still have access to my gmail account, of course, but I have yet to go back.

My experience is that, very quickly, I only need to occasionally check the old email. I still get a few useful emails here and there, but it's manageable.

Set up the IMAP link so that anything sent to your gmail gets delivered to fastmail. Doing so also allows you to send email from your gmail address (with valid spf/dkim) if you want to.3. Import all your old mail using fastmail's import tool, which Just Works.4. Set up a vacation autoresponder in gmail that responds only to people in your contacts with a note telling them your new address.5. Set up a label and filter in fastmail for anything that was addressed to your gmail, so you can easily see what is still sending you email on your old address to assist with migrating services.--It worked a charm. I was completely convinced of it within a week, long before the 30 day free trial ran out. I have been an immensely happy customer since then. Could not imagine going back.",

I've always been a big fan of TUI applications like lazygit, k9s, and dive. And then the idea came to build a TUI application that shows devices on your LAN. I am by no means a networking expert, but it was fun to figure out how ARP works, and discovery protocols such as mDNS and SSDP.Example usage:---# install via HomeBrew\nbrew tap ramonvermeulen/whosthere\nbrew install whosthere# or with go install\ngo install github.com/ramonvermeulen/whosthere@latest# run as TUI\nwhosthere# run as daemon\nwhosthere daemon --port 8080---I'd love to hear your feedback, if you have ideas for additional features or improvements that is highly appreciated!

What disks does the IA use? Any specific variety or like Backblaze a large variety?* magnetic is bloody slow: I'm not the Internet Archive so I'm just going to have a couple of machines with a few hundred TiB. I'm planning on making them all a big zfs so I can deduplicate but it seems like if I get a single disk failure I'm doomed to a massive rebuildI'm sure I can work it out with a modern LLM, but maybe someone here has experience with actually running massive storage and the use-case where tomorrow's data is almost the same as today's  - as is the case with the Internet Archive where tomorrow's copy of wiki.roshangeorge.dev will look, even at the block level, like yesterday's copy.The last time I built with multi-petabyte datasets we were still using Hadoop on HDFS, haha!",

The library used to be the only place where you could just read swaths of magazines, newspapers, and books, and also check out music- for free.Also, I love random stuff. IA has digitized tape recordings that used to play in K-Mart. While Wikipedia spends time culling history that people have submitted, IA keeps it. They understand the duty they have when you donate part of human history to them, instead of some person that didn’t care about some part of history just deleting it.IA is not just its storage and the Wayback machine, even though those things are incredible and a massive part of its value to humanity. It’s someone that just cares.At the end of the day, big companies just need to make profit. Do big companies care about your digitized 8-track collection you have in cloud storage? One day maybe they will take it away from you to avoid a lawsuit or to get you to rent music from them.And your local NAS and backups? Do you think your niche archive will survive a space heater safety mechanism failure, a pipe bursting, when your house is collateral damage in a war, or your accidental death? I understand wanting to keep your own copies of things just-in-case, but if you want those things to survive, why not also host them at IA if others generally would find joy or knowledge from them?",

One may choose tapes for better reliability even for amounts of data that are insufficient to amortize the initial cost for tape drive + SAS HBA card + SAS cables.This is especially true when you take into account that regardless whether you use HDDs or tapes, you should better duplicate them and preferably not keep the copies in the same place.The difference in cost between tapes and HDDs becomes significantly greater when you take into account that data stored on HDDs must be copied on new HDDs after a few years, due to the short lifetime of HDDs. The time after which you may need to move data on new tapes is not determined by the lifetime of tapes (guaranteed to be at least 30 years) but by the obsolescence of the tape drives for a given standard, and it should be after at least 10 to 15 years.If you keep on a SSD/HDD a database of the content of the tapes, containing the metadata of the stored files and their location on tapes, the access time to archived data is composed of whatever time you need for taking the tape from a cabinet and inserting it into the drive, plus a seeking time of around 1 minute, on average.Once the archived data is reached, the sequential transfer speed of tapes is greater than that of HDDs.LTO-9 cartridges have a significantly lower volume and weight than 24-TB HDDs (for storing the same amount of data), which simplifies storage and transport.",

You can just do the most boring thing and it will be fine. I'm just running 1, tho. The hard parts are having it be efficient, quiet and cheap which always feels like an impossible triangle.Yeah, resilvers will take 24h if your pool is getting full but with RAIDZ2 it's not that scary.I'm running TrueNAS scale. I used to just use Ubuntu (more flexible!) but over many years I had a some bad upgrades where kernel & zfs stopped being friends. My rack is pretty nearby so for me, a big 4U case with 120mm front fans was high priority, it has a good noise profile if you replace with Noctuas, you get a constant \"whoosh\" rather than a whine etc.Running 8+2 with 24tb drives. I used to run with 20 slots full of old ex-cloud SAS drives but it's more heat / noise / power intensive. Also, you lose flexibility if you don't have free slots. So eventually ponied up for 24tb disks. It hurt my wallet but greatly reduced noise and power.  Case: RM43-320-RS 4U\n\n  CPU: Intel Xeon E3-1231 v3 @ 3.40GHz (4C/8T, 22nm, 80W TDP)\n  RAM: 32GB DDR3 ECC\n  Motherboard: Supermicro X10SL7-F (microATX, LGA1150 socket)\n    - Onboard: Dual Intel I210 1GbE (unused)\n    - Onboard: LSI SAS2308 8-port SAS2 controller (6Gbps, IT mode)\n    - Onboard: Intel C220 chipset 6-port SATA controller\n\n  Storage Controllers:\n    - LSI SAS2308 (onboard) → Intel RES2SV240 backplane (SFF-8087 cables)\n    - Intel C220 SATA (onboard) → boot SSD\n\n  Backplane:\n    - Intel RES2SV240 24-bay 2U/3U SAS2 Expander\n    - 20× 3.5\" hot-swap bays (10 populated, 10 empty)\n    - Connects via Mini SAS HD SFF-8643 to Mini SAS SFF-8087 Cable, 0.8M x 5\n\n  Boot/Cache:\n    - Intel 120GB SSD SSDSC2CW120A3 (boot drive, SATA)\n    - Intel Optane 280GB SSDPED1D280GA (ZFS SLOG device, NVMe)\n\n  Network:\n    - Intel 82599ES dual-port 10GbE SFP+ NIC (PCIe x8 add-in card)\n\nIt's a super old box but it does fine and will max 10Gbe for sequential and do 10k write iops / 1k random read iops  without problems. Not great, not terrible. You don't really need the SLOG unless you plan to run VMs or databases off it.I personally try to run with no more than 10 slots out of 20 used. This gives a bit of flexibility for expanding, auxiliary pools, etc etc.  Often you find you need twice as much storage as you're planning on directly using. For upgrades, snapshots, transfers, ad-hoc stuff etc.Re: dedup, I would personally look to dedup at the application layer rather than in the filesystem if I possibly could? If you are running custom archiving software then it's something you'd want to handle in the scope of that. Depends on the data obviously, but it's going to be more predictable, and you understand your data the best. I don't have zfs de-dup turned on but for a 200TiB pool with 128k blocks, the zfs DDT will want like 500GiB ram. Which is NOT cheap in 2026.I also run a 7-node ceph cluster \"for funsies\". I love the flexibility of it... but I don't think ceph truly makes sense until you have multiple racks or you have hard 24/7 requirements.",

I am not quick to the point but you need to split your storage up. use 18+ SMR disks, shingled magnetic recording hard drives, for larger stuff that you don't need to transfer very fast. 4k video for consumption on a 4k televsion fits here. Use faster, more reliable disks for data used a lot, &cHot or fast seeks & transfers is different, but i didn't get the idea that's what you were after. Hadoop ought be used for hot data, imo.

The full workflow would look like this:1. Accept comments via email, CGI scripts, server-side program or by any other means that suits you.  A simple hack that requires no server-side scripting: if you run your own web server, you can submit comments as GET query parameters logged in access.log, then extract them using grep, sed, etc.  Personally, I use a server-side program to accept POST requests and write comments to a text file on the web server.2. Review submitted comments.  Delete spam.3. Add comments to your website source repository as .md, .html or whatever format you use, similar to how you add blog posts as content files to your source.4. Render comments alongside the rest of your site using your static site generator.  Depending on the nature of your static site generator, this may require using or creating a template or layout that iterates over the comments and renders them.It is a fairly hands-on workflow, so it may not suit everybody, but this is how I do it for my personal website.  I see two main benefits of this approach.  Since the review is manual in step 2, no spam can ever make it to my website.

          "content": "Having done a similar \"rendition\" to a book of poetry, I agree it is not the same as translating directly. It does open up a question about the fuzziness of \"what is even translation?\"Especially when we talk about translating historic writing. Yes, not knowing the source language is a huge barrier. But so is not knowing specific cultural touchstones or references in the text. In-depth translations usually transliterate as a part of the process. Many words and language patterns are untranslatable, which is why perfect translations are impossible.When translating poetry, issues of meter and rhythm are even more important. It comes down to what the purpose of a translation is meant to achieve. Yes, there are ideas and themes but there is no hiding the fact that translators always imprint their own perspective on a work - it's unavoidable and personally shouldn't even be the goal.Most translators of popular texts look closely at other translations to \"triangulate\" on meaning and authorial intent. Older translations may use archaic writing but have historical understanding, well-researched translations may be more precise about tricky words or concepts. More \"writerly\" translations tend to rebuild the work from the building blocks and produce a more cohesive whole. None of these are wrong approaches.I like the term \"rendition\" because it throws away the concept of the \"authoritative translation\". I like to think of translations the same way as cover songs. The best covers may be wildly different from the original but they share the same roots.As a reader, if you can't ever \"hear\" the original because you don't know thr language you can still appreciate someone's \"cover version\", or triangulate the original by reading multiple translations.",

I don't really understand it but I can speak and read Chinese and it doesn't make much sense to Chinese people either. It is the weirdest thing that it has become famous.This is kind of how it translates in English:'Light light moon\ngreen grass mountain\nsnow sun together'For an entire book. It's totally nonsensical but the writing in Chinese at that time was just a bit like that. Classical Chinese sort of seems to have been written more like the way rappers put together their battling rhymes sometimes - you aren't meant to understand it",

I first saw it as \"the way that can be described is not the Way\", but also \"the way that can be traveled is not the eternal Way\". That is, the eternal (spiritual) Way cannot be concretized, just as a name is not the real thing. Or, given that this is HN, \"the software development methodology that can be executed like a program is not software development methodology\". (\"The Agile that can be PM'd is not Agile.\")However, I think it might require some life maturity to recognize that. Certainly a recovery from Englightenment rationalism. My person experience is that an understanding that \"the name that can be named/identified is not the eternal Name\" and \"the way that can be walked is not the eternal Way\" took me until around my 40s to appreciate.Daoism also appears to have taken a literalist turn (ironically). The book \"Taoism: the Parting of the Ways\" [1], by (former) Harvard Professor Holmes Welch, interprets the text as being a guide to a mystical way of living, similar to St. John of the Cross (minus the Christian part), which is fascinating. Then he describes how the two main factions took the text literally, and how that evolved.[1] I have a summary at http://geoffprewett.com/BookReviews/TaoismThePartingOfTheWay...",

      "url": "https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46696283",
      "content": "I usually build web games in C++, but using Emscripten always felt like overkill for what I was doing. I don't need full POSIX emulation or a massive standard library just to render some stuff to a canvas and handle basic UI.The main thing I wanted to solve was the JS/WASM interop bottleneck. Instead of using the standard glue code for every call, I moved everything to a Shared Memory architecture using Command and Event buffers.The way it works is that I batch all the instructions in WASM and then just send a single \"flush\" signal to JS. The JS side then reads everything directly out of Shared Memory in one go. It’s way more efficient, I ran a benchmark rendering 10k rectangles on a canvas and the difference was huge: Emscripten hit around 40 FPS, while my setup hit 100 FPS.But writing DOM logic in C++ is painful, so I built Coi. It’s a component-based language that statically analyzes changes at compile-time to enable O(1) reactivity. Unlike traditional frameworks, there is no Virtual DOM overhead; the compiler maps state changes directly to specific handles in the command buffer.I recently benchmarked this against React and Vue on a 1,000-row table: Coi came out on top for row creation, row updating and element swapping because it avoids the \"diffing\" step entirely and minimizes bridge crossings. Its bundle size was also the smallest of the three.One of the coolest things about the architecture is how the standard library works. If I want to support a new browser API (like Web Audio or a new Canvas feature), I just add the definition to my WebCC schema file. When I recompile the Coi compiler, the language automatically gains a new standard library function to access that API. There is zero manual wrapping involved.I'm really proud of how it's coming along. It combines the performance of a custom WASM stack with a syntax that actually feels good to write (for me atleast :P). Plus, since the intermediate step is C++, I’m looking into making it work on the server side too, which would allow for sharing components across the whole stack.Example (Coi Code):component Counter(string label, mut int& value) {    def add(int i) : void {\n        value += i;\n    }\n\n    style {\n        .counter {\n            display: flex;\n            gap: 12px;\n            align-items: center;\n        }\n        button {\n            padding: 8px 16px;\n            cursor: pointer;\n        }\n    }\n\n    view {\n        <div class=\"counter\">\n            <span>{label}: {value}</span>\n            <button onclick={add(1)}>+</button>\n            <button onclick={add(-1)}>-</button>\n        </div>\n    }\n}component App {\n    mut int score = 0;    style {\n        .app {\n            padding: 24px;\n            font-family: system-ui;\n        }\n        h1 {\n            color: #1a73e8;\n        }\n        .win {\n            color: #34a853;\n            font-weight: bold;\n        }\n    }\n\n    view {\n        <div class=\"app\">\n            <h1>Score: {score}</h1>\n            <Counter label=\"Player\" &value={score} />\n            <if score >= 10>\n                <p class=\"win\">You win!</p>\n            </if>\n        </div>\n    }\n}app {\n    root = App; \n    title = \"My Counter App\"; \n    description = \"A simple counter built with Coi\"; \n    lang = \"en\"; \n}Live Demo: https://io-eric.github.io/coiCoi (The Language): https://github.com/io-eric/coiWebCC: https://github.com/io-eric/webccI'd love to hear what you think.

Your product is borderline optimized to run C++ code on Web (and Coi is a cherry on top of that). Where Emscripten is made to make native C++ application to run on Web - without significant changes to the original source itself.Now, the `webcc::fush()` - what are your thoughts about scalability of the op-codes parsing? Right now it's switch/case based.The flushing part can be tricky, as I see cases when main logic doesn't care about immediate response/sharing data - and it would be good to have a single flush on the end of the frame, and sometimes you'd like to pass data from C++ while it's in its life scope. On top of that, I'd be no surprised that control of what flushes is lost.(I'm speaking from a game developer perspective, some issues I'm thinking aloud might be exaggerated)Last, some suggestion what would make developers more happy is to provide a way to change wasm compilation flags - as a C++ developer I'd love to compile debug wasm code with DWARF, so I can debug with C++ sources.To wrap up - I'm very impressed about the idea and execution.

But:> It’s way more efficient, I ran a benchmark rendering 10k rectangles on a canvas and the difference was huge: Emscripten hit around 40 FPS, while my setup hit 100 FPS.This sounds a bit suspicious tbh.For instance in this Emscripten WebGL2 sample I can move the instance slider to about 25000 before the frame rate drops below 120 fps on my 2021 M1 MBP in Chrome:https://floooh.github.io/sokol-html5/drawcallperf-sapp.htmlEach 'instance draw' is doing one glUniform4iv and one glDrawElements call via Emscripten's regular WebGL2 shim, e.g. 50k calls across the WASM/JS boundary per 120Hz frame, and I'm pretty sure the vast bulk of the execution time is inside the WebGL2 implementation and the actual call overhead from WASM to JS is negligible (also see: https://hacks.mozilla.org/2018/10/calls-between-javascript-a... - e.g. wasm-to-js call overhead is in the nanoseconds area since around 2018).Still, very cool idea to have this command batching, but I doubt that the performance improvement can be explained with the WASM-JS call overhead alone, there must be something else going on (maybe it's as simple as the command buffer approach being more cache-friendly, or the tight decoding loop on the JS side allowing more JIT optimizations by the JS engine - but the differences you saw are still baffling, because IME 10k fairly simple operations in 25 or 10 milliseconds (e.g. 40 or 100fps) are not enough too see much of a difference by CPU caches or inefficient JIT code generation, and by far most of the time should be spent inside the WebGL2 implementation, and that should be the same no matter if a traditional shim or the command buffer approach is used).",

I'm actually using it myself to port my game engine, currently in the process of ripping out Emscripten entirely.On the opcode parsing - the switch/case approach is intentionally simple and surprisingly fast. Modern compilers turn dense switch statements into jump tables, so it's essentially O(1) dispatch.Your flush timing concern is understandable, but the architecture actually handles this cleanly. Buffered commands accumulate, and anything that returns a value auto-flushes first to guarantee correct ordering. For game loops, the natural pattern is batch everything during your frame logic, single flush at the end. You don't lose control, the auto-flush on sync calls ensures execution order is always maintained.DWARF debug support is a great call",

          "content": "Thanks for the feedback! You're absolutely right to question this.Just to clarify, my benchmark was using Canvas2D, not WebGL, that's why the numbers are much lower than your WebGL2 example. Based on your comment I actually removed the command batching to test the difference, and yeah, the batching optimization is smaller than I initially thought. WebCC with batched commands hits ~100 FPS, without batching it's ~86 FPS, and Emscripten is ~40 FPS. So the batching itself only contributes about ~14 FPS.The bigger performance difference compared to Emscripten seems to come from how Canvas2D operations are handled. Emscripten uses their val class for JS interop which wraps each canvas call in their abstraction layer. WebCC writes raw commands (opcode + arguments) directly into a buffer that the JS side decodes with a tight switch statement. The JS decoder already has direct references to canvas objects and can call methods immediately without property lookups or wrapper overhead. With 10k draw calls per frame, these small per-call differences (property access, type boxing/unboxing, generic dispatch) compound significantly.",

As the Rabbi looked closer, he saw that every person had wooden slats splinted to their arms, stretching from their shoulders to their wrists. Their arms were perfectly straight and stiff; they could pick up a spoon, but they could not bend their elbows to bring the food to their own mouths. They sat in front of a feast, starving in bitterness.The Rabbi then visited Gan Eden (Heaven). To his surprise, he saw the exact same hall, the same tables, and the same magnificent food. Even more shocking, the people there also had wooden slats splinted to their arms, keeping them from bending their elbows.\n But here, the hall was filled with laughter and song. The people were well-fed and glowing. As the Rabbi watched, he saw a man fill his spoon and reach across the table, placing the food into the mouth of the man sitting opposite him. That man, in turn, filled his spoon and fed his friend.The Rabbi returned to Hell and whispered to one of the starving men, \"You do not have to starve! Reach across and feed your neighbor, and he will feed you.\"\n The man in Hell looked at him with spite and replied, \"What? You expect me to feed that fool across from me? I would rather starve than give him the pleasure of a full belly!\"",

Essentially, Miami was handling Bogota's subnets. This is not an issue.- because you don't normally advertise arbitrary prefixes via BGP, policies were used. These policies are essentially if/then statements, carrying out certain actions (advertise or not, add some tags or remove them,...) if some conditions are matched. This is completely normal.- Juniper router configuration for this kind of policy is (simplifying):set <BGP POLICY NAME> from <CONDITION1>set <BGP POLICY NAME> from <CONDITION2>set <BGP POLICY NAME> then <ACTION1>set <BGP POLICY NAME> then <ACTION2>...- prior to the incident, CF changed its network so that Miami didn't have to handle Bogota subnets (maybe Bogota does it on its own, maybe there's another router somewhere else)- the change aimed at removing the configurations on Miami which were advertising Bogota subnets- the change implementation essentially removed all lines from all policies containing \"from IP in the list of Bogota prefixes\". This is somewhat reasonable, because you could have the same policy handling both Bogota and, say, Quito prefixes, so you just want to remove the Bogota part.HOWEVER, there was at least one policy like this:(Before)set <BGP POLICY NAME> from is_internal(prefix) == Trueset <BGP POLICY NAME> from prefix in bogota_prefix_listset <BGP POLICY NAME> then advertise(After)set <BGP POLICY NAME> from is_internal(prefix) == Trueset <BGP POLICY NAME> then advertiseWhich basically means: if you have an internal prefix advertise it- an \"internal prefix\" is any prefix that was not received by another BGP entity (autonomous system)- BGP routers in Cloudflare exchange routes to one another. This is again pretty normal.- As a result of this change, all routes received by Miami through some other Cloudflare router were readvertised by Miami- the result is CF telling the Internet (more accurately, its peers) \"hey, you know that subnet? Go ask my Miami router!\"- obviously, this increases bandwidth utilization and latency for traffic crossing the Miami router.",

You’re simply removing one condition, leaving all ssh traffic to be discarded. That’s essentially what happened with the BGP outage, only here you have no BGP communities to save you.That’s why I re-read the RCA, because this kind of incident is way more general than BGP-specific misconfigurations.",

It should not be that much extra work to add like 10% more route changes (again - you’d batch the new route advertisements in one cohort rather than updating each individual route back and forth).And stuck routes are a problem but not one this would make worse since those routes would get stuck from normal changes anyway.The propagation problem isn’t real because clearly most route advertisements that handle most of the traffic actually happen quickly. You shouldn’t care about the long tail - you want to minimize the risk of your new route. The old route being present isn’t a problem and the new route disappearing back to the old also shouldn’t be a problem UNLESS the new route was buggy in which case you wanted to rollback anyway.TLDR: these don’t feel like risks unique to advertising and then undoing it given the route publishing already has to be handled anyway AND cloudflare is a major Tier 1 ISP and handles a good chunk of the entire internet’s traffic. This isn’t about a strategy for some random tier 2/3 ISP.",

Other BGP config changes leading to problems are often global changes, but you can check diffs and apply the config change one host at a time. You can't really make a simultaneous change anyway. Maybe one host changing is ok, but the Nth one causes a problem... CF has a lot of BGP routers, so maybe checking every diff is too much, but at least check a few.Is that something out of the box on routers? I don't know, people with BGP routers never let me play with them. But given the BGP haiku, I'd want something like that before I messed around with things. For the price you pay for these fancy routers, you should be able to buy an extra few to run sandboxed config testing on.
