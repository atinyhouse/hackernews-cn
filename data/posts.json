      "abstract": "该讨论围绕美元是否正在失去全球主导地位这一核心话题展开。有用户指出，去美元化正在局部发生，例如美元在全球储备中的占比已降至约58-60%，外国持有的美国国债比例也下降到30%。然而，也有用户强调，美元的核心主导地位依然稳固，目前尚无明确替代方案，人民币、黄金或石油等选项均难以撼动其地位。讨论中提到，黄金价格走势反映出市场对货币贬值和政策不确定性的担忧，部分观点认为美元地位是被刻意削弱而非自然衰落。尽管存在分歧，但多数用户认同美元影响力正缓慢减弱，同时普遍认为这并不等同于美国全球主导地位的衰退，两者不宜直接挂钩。",

This is likely to continue.Making inferences about the US global dominance based on this fact is misguided. US global dominance is as strong as ever and, if anything, getting stronger. US has very successfully managed to move the game a level above currency, to direct governance via financial, legal, political and military means.

In the colonial era, Germany as a fairly new state and unlike the UK, Spain, France, even Portugal or the Netherlands, they didn't have colonies to exploit. Worse, in the industrialization era they didn't have access to oil.This created a paranoia in Germany, an insecurity that were between Great Powers and were dependent on imports and poorer than their neighbours. They felt like they'd eventually get swallowed unless they did something and the end result was WWI. And WW2 if you think about it.The cost of victory against Germany (twice) was huge. All those Great Powers lost their colonies and they impoverished themselves with war economies while enriching the United States who, at times, sold arms to all sides.The US is that Great Power now, complete with colonies. It's energy independent too. So it's nohting like Germany. In fact it's turned Europe into a client state (ie through NATO). These aren't colonies in the British Empire sense of occupying India, for example. It's economic colonialism. The Global South is controlled via the IMF and World Bank. The developed world is controlled with security gurantees.But where I agree with you is that an absolutel moron has come along and threatens to dismantle this entire system. That's what's happening. Splintering NATO, abolishing USAID, etc all diminish American soft (and hard) power.China's foreign policy has become to sit and wait while the US destroys itself. They don't have to do anything anymore. It's why i laugh when people predict China will invade Taiwan. No they won't. Why? Because they don't have to. As a reminder, One China is the official policy of the US government.My problem is that empires don't die quietly. They die violently. And we're going to see a wave of fascism.

Triffin covered this at length in his address to the Joint Economic Committee of Congress in 1959, but in short, the USD acting as world reserve currency creates demand for the dollar, which the US has to be able to supply, which pre-1971 meant extreme strain on her gold supply, and post-1971 means greater monetary inflation.",

You are always trading one currency for another eg selling GBP to buy USD. What that means is currencies are always about the value of one currency relative to other currencies.In that sense they do fundamentally relate to trust and in particular specifically in this case about trust of the US economy and financial system's stability as opposed to other economies and financial systems.So there have been times (eg during the financial crisis) where people think all currencies are bad but you can't just sell all of them so typically they would sell the other ones for dollars.

I buy and sell both stocks and bullion on long-term (years), and am typically only selling when I get over-extended on a project (construction renovations) and absolutely need liquidity [e.g: today's visit]. Young-forty-something.But today at my US coin store (in a no-tax state), you could buy/sell a Canadian Mapleleaf (an ounce of 99.99% gold in easily-recognizable coin format) for 2.5% spot. For real physical gold that you can hold & hear (isn't fake/heavily-leveraged \"paper gold\").I never recommend anybody transacts less than an ounce because the fees rapidly increase on smaller denominations (e.g. tenths are fee-prohibitive, other than as less-expensive gifts for recent graduates). Buy ounce coins, long-term, at regular intervals (no timing the market, only time IN the market!).Silver is a wildcard, at least at my local shops. Today it cost me 6.5% to unload a few hundred ounces — which sucks, but shops are buying lots of silver right now given its recent increases; this increases their risk (should the market correct, which it probably will around $100 IMHO). Typically this would have been about 4.5% — still, I more than quadrupled my original investment (from just a few years ago).So definitely you shouldn't be buying/selling bullion short term (fees will eat you alive!) — but it is always nice to have an emergency fund that isn't fiat (i.e. losing value guaranteed) but is also immediately convertible back into currency (no mail / ACH / bank delays).I have about a year of my normal income in physical bullion. Most I've been holding on to for years — which is how you should transact physical metals. Timing any market is impossible... it doesn't always even rhyme.[•] https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dollar_cost_averagingDisclaimer: I am a forty-something electrician — not your financial advisor — and am the type of risk-taker that has \"stupidly\" taken 10% of his paycheck in bitcoin/bullion, since 2013.",

No foreign entity can afford to absorb $2 trillion of new paper every year. That's equal to the total holdings of China + Japan. Going forward you might as well regard all US Govt borrowing as domestic, as that will essentially be the case given the scale. The UK holds $885b of treasuries, what are they going to buy annually that will make a difference at this point?Every nation has a limitless ability to borrow internally via currency debasement, with obvious consequences. That USD debasement is why gold has gone up 10x in 20 years when priced in dollars. It's why healthcare and housing is so expensive - when priced in dollars. Cash pushed into gold in 2005, $100k, would now buy you a million dollar house. It's the dollar of course that has been hammered (among other currencies, the Euro has not done well against gold either).The US won't stop being able to debase its currency and buy its own debt. What the US is doing is eating its hand. If it continues to get worse, it moves on to eating its arm, and so on (the US is de facto consuming its national wealth through stealth confiscation via currency destruction, rather than paying the bills with taxation directly).",

We have a curious company car tax regime where CO2 emissions are used to define the tax rates so hybrids are somewhat lower, although it's still onerous compared to just buying a car personally.However, pure EVs are taxed at very low rates in comparison, so if you own a company or have the ability to do a \"salary sacrifice\" for a car with your employer, it becomes very tax advantageous to get an EV. Your company can also pay for your insurance, EV charge installation, public charging costs (even for private mileage) and so forth, so it's very common to see small business owners in EVs compared to private buyers. Porsches also tend to have particularly low monthly payments compared to their value since I guess they hold their value well and can be traded back in at the end of the financing period.

I have driven many cars in my life, from very cheap to very expensive. For me personally, Porsche is in my opinion comparable to using a Mac - they're one of the few who \"get it right\":- The entire workmanship is fantastic—nothing wobbles and nothing rattles. \n- Everything looks very harmonic, from interior to usability. Every button is where it has to be. Even the built-in entertainment system is highly usable (which in my opinion others like Mercedes never got right).\n- And, most importantly, despite being ICE or EV, the whole driving experience is just lightyears away from many competitors. Whether it's a 911 or a 718, they are just a joy to drive. Even a Cayenne just doesn't feel like a bulky SUV. There seems to be a lot of engineering going into all of that, weight distribution, chassis tuning, etc.Apart from that - again, having owned many cars in my life - they're the most service-unintense cars ever. They just - work. You change the oil, sometimes the tires and that's it. I never had a single bigger problem with them.Is there a lot of stuff which they didn't get? Agreed. Would it be nice to have better self-driving options? Without a doubt, but that's just a question of time.But at least you have to give them that they, in strong contrast to many other German car manufacturers, didn't miss the trend and started to produce sexy EVs (hello Taycan) from very early on.As long as I can, I will stay a loyal customer to them. If you have never driven a Porsche, get a test drive. I can only highly recommend it.PS: And double points if you can do it on the German Autobahn. Try driving 240+ km/h with any other large-volume-production car, you'll be sweaty. With a Porsche, it just feels joyful.",

Classic case of 'we've tried nothing and we're all out of ideas'.Unions sabotaged automation efforts and limited hours worked. Quarterly financial pressures kept research investments to a minimum. Nations refused to scale up nuclear, and cost of electricity kept rising. The one well-run EV company (Tesla) decided to destroy its brand value overnight. Toyota went on a pig-headed hydrogen tangent and Honda still hasn't tried to make an EV. Korea has done surprisingly well. But, they're the exception that proves the rule.China's rise as a manufacturing superpower was inevitable. But its rise as an automotive superpower involved major capitulation by the primary competition.",

Currently have a Audi, been looking at various BYD models, particularly the new Touring one.One important feature, that I didn't know I needed before I tried it, was in-seat AC, where the air from the AC hits the back and bottom, instead of just your arms and face. Living in a warm country, and spending most of the time in the car during the summer, this feature is something I really want now.Heading to Audi and asking what the cheapest model available with that feature? Around 70K EUR. Doing the same but going to BYD: 35K EUR. And that's just considering that single feature, the same happens for almost everything. Want a HUD in the windshield? Audi adds 5K to the price, with BYD it's in the middle variants and up.Basically, you get the same amount of \"features\" for half the price, and it's hard to just say \"Well, I'm a fan of Audi so that's worth the markup\". Still, there are many decisions that go into purchasing a car, not just the features, but I think that explains why you see that argument come up, because they do offer more features for cheaper than at least what the European car makers do.",

Mobile games from that era had cultural impact. I bought $2 apps without a thought.But Apple incentivized monetization above all else and killed that excitement. Now you can’t find a tip calculator that doesn’t charge a monthly subscription. A popular flight tracker is $60/year (or a $300 purchase). A flash card app costs the same. Apple’s curated list of “essential utilities” includes a birthday countdown that costs $5/wk.I know every app will cost me hundreds over the span of just a few years for marginal utility so I simply stopped buying them.

TikTok was the top 'ad' result for all of them. Then i did a search for TikTok and got some random app i've never heard of as the 'ad' result. Its like it doesn't want the same app to fill both of the top two slots, but there is always an ad. So what you are looking for is always second on the list.

Generally it occurs just after widespread monetary debasement and just before major, world shaking disasters. (You Are Here.)Reference: Andrew Dickson White (first president of Cornell) \"Fiat Money Inflation In France\", published 1896:\"The government now began, and continued by spasms to grind out still more paper; commerce was at first stimulated by the difference in exchange; but this cause soon ceased to operate, and commerce, having been stimulated unhealthfully, wasted away.Manufactures at first received a great impulse; but, ere long, this overproduction and overstimulus proved as fatal to them as to commerce. From time to time there was a revival of hope caused by an apparent revival of business; but this revival of business was at last seen to be caused more and more by the desire of far-seeing and cunning men of affairs to exchange paper money for objects of permanent value.  As to the people at large, the classes living on fixed incomes and small salaries felt the pressure first, as soon as the purchasing power of their fixed incomes was reduced. Soon the great class living on wages felt it even more sadly.Prices of the necessities of life increased: merchants were obliged to increase them, not only to cover depreciation of their merchandise, but also to cover their risk of loss from fluctuation; and, while the prices of products thus rose, wages, which had at first gone up under the general stimulus, lagged behind. Under the universal doubt and discouragement, commerce and manufactures were checked or destroyed. As a consequence the demand for labor was diminished; laboring men were thrown out of employment, and, under the operation of the simplest law of supply and demand, the price of labor--the daily wages of the laboring class--went down until, at a time when prices of food, clothing and various articles of consumption were enormous, wages were nearly as low as at the time preceding the first issue of irredeemable currency.\"",

If you are a football/baseball/soccer player and you bet your team will lose, you have an obvious way to drastically increase your odds (especially if you are a top player) - playing bad. Other people are completely unaware of this deal.Having fire insurance and burning your car is in most jurisdictions illegal. Yes, you should be paid if your car is burned, but if you do it intentionally, you are obviously increasing the chances of getting paid, unless of course the insurance company finds out you did it.\nAnd so on.I don't see why these situations would be illegal and, say, betting against the survival of a regime when you're actually working against it, would be legal.Things are even harder if you coordinate multiple people. For example, let's say 100 people bet that there will be a riot in town X by the end of the year. X is normally a quiet town so most people bet against. These 100 people bet this will happen 10 minutes before actually starting a riot themselves. Yes, someone could observe last minute trends and might predict reality, but last minute or huge bets are not necessarily true - someone could bet on random things for a variety of reasons. So it's not even useful as a way to get insights into the reality.",

This then puts the prediction market in a place where it is the \"arbiter\" of reality - in a world where media has become so corrupt and full of noise, finding out what actually happened can be really hard.So then, a market such as this seems inevitable to me because you can then point to markets and say \"see, it resolved this way.\" It does not perfectly align with truth but with market forces would probably lead to more truth than a reality where you just cherrypick whatever biased source that makes you feel good does.

On the surface, that just seems like a morbid bet. Once you consider the above form of insider trading, you realize that this can act as a reward for someone who can accurately predict the death date of said person, for example because they're making the counter-trade from a phone next to a high-powered rifle on the rooftop across the street - and like in the bribe example above, the people on the \"losing\" side of the bet might not mind too much. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assassination_market",

For example, in my mind, betting on whether you will win a game of chess is not gambling. On the other hand, if you cannot influence the outcome in your favour through skill, then it is gambling. Roulette is generally a good example of this (with the caveat that in some very specific circumstances it's possible to beat with skill).If we're limiting the definition to merely risk-taking (you might win or you might lose) without factoring in skill, then virtually everything in life becomes gambling. For example, you gamble when you deposit money in the bank because it might go bust.There's also the legal definition, in which case it's just a matter of checking whether the jurisdiction you are in considers the activity to be gambling or not.",

Someone doing this for a living is a professional gambler.What for me would be a sensible definition is that a bet/gamble has no other goals. Putting money in the bank/investing in a stock reallocates capital, which can be invested by someone. The fact that it is a risk-taking endeavor is merely a side effect.

They were delighted at the apparent advance in the value of the goods upon their shelves. But they soon found that, as they increased prices to cover the inflation of currency and the risk from fluctuation and uncertainty, purchases became less in amount and payments less sure; a feeling of insecurity spread throughout the country; enterprise was deadened and stagnation followed.New issues of paper were then clamored for as more drams are demanded by a drunkard. New issues only increased the evil; capitalists were all the more reluctant to embark their money on such a sea of doubt. Workmen of all sorts were more and more thrown out of employment.  Issue after issue of currency came; but no relief resulted save a momentary stimulus, which aggravated the disease. The most ingenious evasions of natural laws in finance which the most subtle theorists could contrive were tried--all in vain; the most brilliant substitutes for those laws were tried; \"self-regulating\" schemes, \"interconverting\" schemes--all equally vain.  All thoughtful men had lost confidence.  All men were waiting; stagnation became worse and worse. At last came the collapse and then a return, by a fearful shock, to a state of things which presented something like certainty of remuneration to capital and labor. Then, and not till then, came the beginning of a new era of prosperity.Just as dependent on the law of cause and effect was the moral development. Out of the inflation of prices grew a speculating class; and, in the complete uncertainty as to the future, all business became a game of chance, and all business men, gamblers. In city centers came a quick growth of stock-jobbers and speculators; and these set a debasing fashion in business which spread to the remotest parts of the country. Instead of satisfaction with legitimate profits, came a passion for inordinate gains. Then, too, as values became more and more uncertain, there was no longer any motive for care or economy, but every motive for immediate expenditure and present enjoyment. So came upon the nation the obliteration of thrift.\"",

It shouldn't be surprising that the evolutionary reward mechanism for acting rational (big oxytocin hit when you predict something correctly) could get miscalibrated for a subset of the population; that's just biology.I also think you're making a massive error by conflating criticism of betting with criticism of betting markets, though. Nobody is upset about people dealing with the natural risk of day-to-day life; the problem is that people are now being incentivized to take on additional risk (beyond the day-to-day) which they are poorly equipped to reason about. The systems governing the dynamics of geopolitical events (or other things you can estimate in a betting market) are staggeringly complex, and assigning credences to them is an epistemological nightmare that even the most seasoned experts struggled to do reliably.

To feed it, there came cheatery in the nation at large and corruption among officials and persons holding trusts. While men set such fashions in private and official business, women set fashions of extravagance in dress and living that added to the incentives to corruption. Faith in moral considerations, or even in good impulses, yielded to general distrust. National honor was thought a fiction cherished only by hypocrites. Patriotism was eaten out by cynicism.Thus was the history of France logically developed in obedience to natural laws; such has, to a greater or less degree, always been the result of irredeemable paper, created according to the whim or interest of legislative assemblies rather than based upon standards of value permanent in their nature and agreed upon throughout the entire world. Such, we may fairly expect, will always be the result of them until the ñat of the Almighty shall evolve laws in the universe radically different from those which at present obtain.And, finally, as to the general development of the theory and practice which all this history records: my subject has been Fiat Money in France; How it came; What it brought; and How it ended.It came by seeking a remedy for a comparatively small evil in an evil infinitely more dangerous. To cure a disease temporary in its character, a corrosive poison was administered, which ate out the vitals of French prosperity.It progressed according to a law in social physics which we may call the \"law of accelerating issue and depreciation.\" It was comparatively easy to refrain from the first issue; it was exceedingly difficult to refrain from the second; to refrain from the third and those following was practically impossible.It brought, as we have seen, commerce and manufactures, the mercantile interest, the agricultural interest, to ruin. It brought on these the same destruction which would come to a Hollander opening the dykes of the sea to irrigate his garden in a dry summer.

New technologies are treated  as guilty until proven innocent, because that is a more engaging narrative for readers. So in this case, those covering this stuff immediately latch onto the rich get richer, insider trading viewpoint, and that gets reported without any analysis of why that might actually be desirable.Second, prediction markets, in trying to become broadly accessible to \"normal\" people and desiring liquidity, need a marketing strategy that is understandable. They can't put out a Robin Hanson article as marketing material. So they market by appealing to something people do already understand, which is gambling. The public has this idea now of prediction markets as a way to make money, not as a tool for learning information. So the default perspective on insider trading is now one of unfairness: somebody used their privileged position to make money. The correct perspective is, in fact, that prediction markets are providing users with value by eliciting information from those insiders, information that the public would not otherwise have.

I was arbitraging this market for the whole year on any \"new\" hillary news, so paid very close attention to the discussion circles happening around it - I checked in after the market closed and many of the genuine \"YES\" people putting up as much money as they were able to concluded PredictIt was incorrect and that Hillary was still the \"phantom\" nominee. It would not at all surprise me if a few of them still believe she actually ran for president. They probably should have closed the market several months before, but they kept it open. If they had closed it at any reasonable point beforehand a huge chunk of the \"YES\" market would have lost their minds.People are goofy and prone to conspiratorial thinking.

There are a lot of ways to implement reactivity that usually require a special interpreter (spreadsheets) or compiler (Svelte).  React's system does show seams (you really need to be on top of identity and equality) but it is remarkably simple.React shines, in my mind, for things that aren't form applications.  For instance, VR applications with AFrame -- it's somewhere between VRML and Unity.  I am working on a (mainly) heart rate variability biofeedback application [2] and it is so easy to make dashboards that display real-time metrics as well as Poincare sections and time series.  That is,  I can slap together a few data processing functions and widgets and make a new dashboard with new metrics and charts or new sensors.  One goal is to get it working on a tablet in a two player version.The disadvantage of React is that it does not work so well for highly dynamic layouts.  In my case I have a library of functions to \"fetch\" the data stream and put them into the top of the component (may even package as hooks) and then put the layout together with JSX.  I'd like to have a version where the user can drag and drop the components to make a custom layout and the system figures out the dependencies for the data fetching,  preparation and processing like the things I made in 2006 and that kind of application with a dynamic layout (think programs like Photoshop with lots of different little widgets and property sheets) wants a different approach to reactivity.[1] use of macros in that book is a red herring,  the one example in it where you really need macros is when he is implementing cooperative multitasking, a feature that Python and Javascript already have -- most examples from that book as with Norvig's Lisp book can be coded up just fine with[2] see https://github.com/paulhoule/VulpusVision it might \"just work\" if you npm install,  npm run dev, and look at it in Chrome and connect with a Polar H10 or other BT monitor",

The problem I have with this argument is that it's simply unsustainable to be spending that much every 2-3 years and we're already seeing this as Google and others are extending their depreciation of GPU's to something like 5-7 years.",

Of course I could easily be wrong, but regardless I think the most predictable cause for a drop in the NVIDIA price would be that the CHIPS act/recent decisions by the CCP leads a Chinese firm to bring to market a CUDA compatible and reliable GPU at a fraction of the cost. It should be remembered that NVIDIA's /current/ value is based on their being locked out of their second largest market (China) with no investor expectation of that changing in the future. Given the current geopolitical landscape, in the hypothetical case where a Chinese firm markets such a chip we should expect that US firms would be prohibited from purchasing them, while it's less clear that Europeans or Saudis would be. Even so, if NVIDIA were not to lower their prices at all, US firms would be at a tremendous cost disadvantage while their competitors would no longer have one with respect to compute.All hypothetical, of course, but to me that's the most convincing bear case I've heard for NVIDIA.",

There is an astounding amount of edge inference sitting in people’s phones and laptops that only slightly got cracked open with Apple Intelligence.Data centre buildouts will get corrected when the numbers come in from Apple: how large of a share in tokens used by the average consumer can be fulfilled with lightweight models and Google searches of the open internet. This will serve as a guiding principle for any future buildout and heavyweight inference cards that Nvidia is supplying. The 2-5 year moat top providers have with the largest models will get chomped at by the leisure/hobby/educational use cases that lightweight models capably handle. Small language and visual models are already amazing. The next crack will appear when the past gen cards (if they survive the around the clock operation) get bought up by second hand operators that can provide capable inference of even current gen models.If past knowledge of DC operators holds (e.g. Google and its aging TPUs that still get use), the providers with the resources to buy new space for newer gens will accumulate the amount of hardware, but the providers who need to continuously shave off the financial hit that comes with using less efficient older cards.I’m excited to see future blogs about hardware geeks buying used inference stacks and repurposing them for home use :)",

That suggestion blocks future progress.Until a human comes in and says \"yes - do it\" or \"no - try X instead\" it will sit there doing nothing.If instead it can just proceed, observe that the package doesn't resolve the issue, and continue exploring other solutions immediately, you save a whole lot of time.",

Shannot is able to auto-approve safe operations for this reason (e.g. read-only, immutable)So the agent can freely explore, check logs, list files, inspect service status. It only blocks when it wants to change something (install a package, write a config, restart a service).Also worth noting: Shannot operates on entire scripts, not individual commands. The agent writes a complete program, the sandbox captures everything it wants to do during a dry run, then you review the whole batch at once. Claude Code's built-in controls interrupt at each command whereas Shannot interrupts once per script with a full picture of intent.That said, you're pointing at a real limitation: if the fix genuinely requires a write to test a hypothesis, you're back to blocking. The agent can't speculatively install a package, observe it didn't help, and roll back autonomously.For that use case, the OP's VM approach is probably better. Shannot is more suited to cases where you want changes applied to the real system but reviewed first.Definitely food for thought though. A combined approach might be the right answer.

But your homelab is unlikely to have long wires or very large loops. Ethernet wires are limited to 100m, and unshielded Ethernet is transformer-isolated to well over 1kV.Shielded Ethernet could plausibly have issues with induced current on the shield. PoE might be less immune than ordinary Ethernet depending on what you’re doing with it, although well-behaved devices should be isolated.  If you have a cable ISP, the cable shield might get toasty, although it’s likely to be grounded close enough to your house that any damage will be upstream.Your 100% uptime will be tricky if your ISP goes down or you lose power.",

This actually happened 20 years ago, an NBA ref went to prison over being bribed just $2000 per game.The much worse example is the fact that you can make 100-1 odds on whether the US airstrikes Iran today... or How many times Pam Bondi says the word \"China\" in a press conference.",

Small edges (an expected loss of 0.57¢ on a 1¢ contract implies an expected gain of 0.43¢ on a 99¢ contract, or a 5.75ppt edge) can be easily eaten by even small fees, and liquidity provision is all about small edges.2. The article ignores the time value of money, and contracts take time to resolve.  If a contract won't resolve for six months and the risk-free rate is 5%, then buying a \"sure thing\" over 97.5¢ is a loss net of otherwise earnable interest.3. Long shots offer greater implied leverage to bettors, making them more attractive.  This is still (sometimes) an exploitable mispricing, but it's closer to the well-understood \"bet against beta\" factor.(Edit to add) Also, I think their explanation of the non-returns on finance is lacking:> Why is Finance efficient? The likely explanation is participant selection; financial questions attract traders who think in probabilities and expected values rather than fans betting on their favorite team or partisans betting on a preferred candidate. The questions themselves are dry (\"Will the S&P close above 6000?\"), which filters out emotional bettors.Financial contracts are the ones that are most perfectly hedges with existing markets.  \"Will the S&P close above X?\" is a binary option, after all, so it's comparatively easy for a market-maker to almost perfectly offset their Kalshi positions with opposite positions in traditional markets.",

I have this abstract prediction market in my head, each bet placed by some statistically average person with diverse experiences and exposures from my own bubble, who carefully considers their information and puts their two cents into the pot, and I assume that by adding all our ideas together we form some sort of combined intelligence which is more insightful and reliable together than any individual pundit could be.And then I go back to the home page, and see all the rabid sports fans, and realize that these bets are not being placed by deep thinkers.",

The real back-end, though, was  an old COBOL system.I remember helping the COBOL programmers debug some stuff, and it was just so wildly foreign. My degree is in theoretical comp sci, and I'd seen a lot of different languages, including Prolog, various lisps and schemes, SQL, ADA, C++, C, Pascal, various assembly variants, but COBOL was simply unique. I've often wondered what ideas COBOL got right that we could learn from and leverage today in a new language.I do remember our COBOL mainframes were really fast compared to the SQL Server layers my middle-tier services used, but I also remember looking at it and thinking it would be a giant pain to write (the numbers at the front of every line seemed like tedium that I would probably often get wrong).",

It's just wild.Some of the tools are even front-facing users (bank employees): at times you can still see at some banks an employee running an app in a monochrome green-on-black text terminal emulator that is basically COBOL.It's weird, just weird. But legacy code is legacy code. And if you think COBOL's legacy is bad, Java is going to dwarf COBOL's legacy big times (for Java is typically used at the kind of places that still use COBOL and it's used way more than COBOL).So in the future, heck, we may have a new language, generating, inside an emulator emulating current machines/OSes, Java code that is going to be code generating COBOL code (!), that's then going to be run in an emulator.",

CNAMEs are name level aliases, not record level, so this \"feature\" would break the caching of NS, MX, and SOA records that exist at domain apexes. Many of us warned them at the time that this would result in a non-deterministic issue. At EC2 and Route 53 we weren't supporting this just to be mean! If a user's DNS resolver got an MX query before an A query, things might work ... but the other way around, they might not. An absolute nightmare to deal with. But move fast and break things, so hey :)In earnest though ... it's great to see how now CloudFare are handling CNAME chains and A record ordering issues in this kind of detail.

For example, systemd-resolved first parses the records into an ordered set:Now think about what real end user devices are using: Windows/macOS/iOS obviously aren't using glibc and Android also has its own C library even though it's Linux-based, and they all probably fall under the \"Most DNS clients don't have this issue.\".That leaves GNU/Linux, where we could reasonably expect most software to use glibc for resolving queries, so presumably anyone using Linux on their laptop would catch this right? Except most distributions started using systemd-resolved (most notable exception is Debian, but not many people use that on desktops/laptops), which is a locally-cached recursive DNS server, and as such acts as a middleman between glibc software and the network configured DNS server, so it would resolve 1.1.1.1 queries correctly, and then return the results from its cache ordered by its own ordering algorithm.",

It states that “The difference in ordering of the RRs in the answer section is not significant.” But from the RFC, very clearly this comment is relevant only to that particular example; it is comparing two responses and saying that in this case, the different ordering has no semantic effect.And perhaps this is somewhat pedantic, but they also write that “RFC 1034 section 3.6 defines Resource Record Sets (RRsets) as collections of records with the same name, type, and class.” But looking at the RFC, it never defines such a term; it does say that within a “set” of RRs “associated with a particular name” the order doesn’t matter. But even if the RFC had said “associated with a particular combination of name, type, and class”, I don’t see how that could have introduced ambiguity. It specifies an exception to a general rule, so obviously if the exception doesn’t apply, then the general rule must be followed.Anyway, Cloudflare probably know their DNS better than I do, but I did not find the article especially persuasive; I think the ambiguity is actually just a misreading, and that the RFC does require a particular ordering of CNAME records.(ETA:) Although admittedly, while the RFC does say that CNAMEs must come before As in the answer, I don’t necessarily see any clear rule about how CNAME chains must be ordered; the RFC just says “Domain names in RRs which point at another name should always point at the primary name and not the alias ... Of course, by the robustness principle, domain software should not fail when presented with CNAME chains or loops; CNAME chains should be followed”.

Everything pre Code Page 1252, in other words. Whilst it was a pragmatic decision for MS, it's also true that marketing needs demanded all text interfaces disappeared because they looked old. Text graphics, doubly so. That design space was now reserved for functional icons. A bit of creativity went from (home) computing right there and then. Stuffing it all into a separate font ensured it died.But, that stuff is genuinely cool to a lot of people in a way VIM, (for example) has never been and nor will it ever.

When they successfully achieve a result by relying on knowledge you get an impression of more reasoning than their is.Everyone seems now familiar with hallucinations. When a model's knowledge is lacking and it is fine tuned to give an answer. A simplistic calculation says that if an accurate answer gets you 100%, then an answer gets you 50% and being accurate gets you 50%.  Hallucinations are trying to get partial credit for bullshit.  Teaching a model that a wrong answer is worse than no answer is the obvious solution, turning that lesson into training methods is harder.That's a bit of a digression but I think it helps explain the difference to why I think a model would find writing an article like this.Models have difficulty in understanding what is important.  The degree to which they do achieve this is amazing, but it is still trained on data that heavily biases their conclusions to the mainstream  thinking.  In that respect I'm not even sure if it is a fundamental lack in what they could do.

There is a fairly common sci-fi trope of an AI giving a thorough and reasoned analysis of a problem only to be cut off by a human wanting the simple and obvious answer. If not done carefully RLHF becomes the embodiment of this trope in action.This gives a result that makes the most people immediately happy, without regard for what is best long term, or indeed what is actually needed.  Asimov explored the notion of robots lying so as to not hurt feelings.  Much of the point of the robot books was to express the notion that what we want AI to be is more complicated than it appears at first glance.",

Some hosting platforms publish via CNAME, and some via A and AAAA records. Most seem to use a mix of v4 and v6 addressing.The falling price of IPv4 addresses looks to me like we’ve made it to other side of the IPv6 rollout: demand for IPv4 is falling faster than supply now. Not clear if those prices are adjusted for inflation; the post-COVID spike looks like a lot of other nominal price graphs. If not, then the recent price drop is even more dramatic than it appears.Perhaps in the long run, IPv4 becomes an artisanal choice for uses that depend on stable IP reputation: email sending, primarily.

AWS was right up there stockpiling before they shifted their pricing model. Once AWS introduced the hourly charge for public IPv4 addresses (effectively passing the scarcity cost to the consumer), their acquisition pressure vanished. The text notes Amazon stopped announcing almost 15M addresses in Nov 2025. I think they have moved from aggressive accumulation to inventory management.We are seeing asset stranding in real-time.

I know that IPv6 can be made secure, but I don't have the background or research time to learn how to do so, and the NAT-by-default of IPv4 effectively means that I get the benefit of a default-deny security strategy that makes it impossible to accidentally directly connect anything to the internet.I'm hoping I can keep using IPv4 until IPv8 or IPv4.5 or whatever comes next is developed with the modern proliferation of cheap insecure IoT in mind.For some background on why IoT products are so insecure:Hardware manufacturers don't really comprehend the idea of updates, let alone timely of security patches.  Hardware has to work on the day of release, so everything is documented and tested to verify it will work.  I have hardware with a TCP/IP stack that was released 20 years, (https://docs.wiznet.io/Product/Chip/Ethernet/W5500) and doesn't have a single errata published, despite widespread use.  This is expected for every single component, for even the smallest 1-cent transistor, which has dozens of guaranteed performance characteristics laid out over several pages of documentation (https://en.mot-mos.com/vancheerfile/files/pdf/MOT2302B2.pdf).When manufacturers venture into a product that runs software, they don't realize that for a given complexity, working through undocumented or, worse yet, incorrectly documented APIs takes more time than the equivalent hardware development and documentation.  I've worked on multiple projects where software bugs were fixed with hardware workarounds, because it's faster, cheaper, and easier to develop, test, document, retool, and add a few cents of bill-of-materials cost per product, than to get reliable output from the already-written library that's supposed to provide the functionality.The hardware TCP/IP stack that I linked to was developed at a time when it was the cheapest way to connect a low-power embedded system to a network.  Modern low-power embedded systems have multiple cores running at hundreds to thousands of MIPS making the resources to run a softtware TCP/IP stack trivial, but the product still sells well, because when security is an absolute must, the hardware development and maintenance cost for the functionality is still cheaper than through software, even when there's no marginal cost to run the software.",

Impressive to see this being done in pure C.I'm the maintainer of MFLUX (https://github.com/filipstrand/mflux) which does a similar thing, but at a higher level using the MLX framework optimised for Apple Silicon. I just merged Flux 2 Klein support as well and was happy to see this discussion :)I started out doing this type of work roughly 1.5 years ago when FLUX.1 was released and have been doing it off and on ever since with newer models, trying to use more and more AI over time.At one point, I vibe-coded a debugger to help the coding agent along. It worked OK but as models have gotten stronger, this doesn't really seem to be needed anymore. My latest version simply has a SKILL.md that outlines my overall porting strategy (https://github.com/filipstrand/mflux/blob/main/.cursor/skill...). Somewhat surprisingly, this actually works now with Cursor + Codex-5.2, with little human intervention.> Even if the code was generated using AI, my help in steering towards the right design, implementation choices, and correctness has been vital during the development.This definitely resonates! Curious to hear more about what worked/didn't for you. A couple of things I've found useful:- Porting the pipeline backwards: This is the way I did it personally before using any coding models. The typical image generation flow is the following:1.Text_encodings (+ random_noise_latent)\n2.Transformer loop \n3.VAE decodingI found that by starting with the VAE first (by feeding it pre-loaded tensors from the reference extracted at specific locations) it was the quickest way to get to an actual generated image. Once the VAE is done and verified, only then proceed backwards the chain and handle the Transformer, etc. I still prefer to do it this way and I like to manually intervene between step 3,2 and 1, but maybe this won't actually be needed soon?- Also, with the VAE, if you care about implementing the encoding functionality (e.g to be used with img2img features), the round-trip test is a very quick way to verify correctness:image_in -> encode -> decode -> image_out : compare(image_in, image_out)- Investing in a good foundation for weight handling, especially when doing repeat work across similar models. Earlier coding models would easily get confused about weight assignment, naming conventions etc. A lot of time could be wasted because weight assignment failed (sometimes silently) early on.",

I have a long time passion about AI, I wrote my first NN implementation in 2003 (used here, many years ago, as a showcase of Redis modules https://github.com/antirez/neural-redis), and never stopped since there to implement, for fun, small GPT models and things like that, using PyTorch or C.Also my work at Redis Vector Sets, in the latest year, exposed me more to working with models (especially text embedding models of many kinds, but also other models).So while Claude was fundamental to get the implementation fast, I had background to have idea about what was happening in the different stages.

          "content": "It depends on the situation. In this case the agent worked only using the reference code provided by Flux's Black Forest Labs which is basically just the pipeline implemented as a showcase. The fundamental way for this process to work is that the agent can have a feedback to understand if it is really making progresses, and to debug failures against a reference implementation. But then all the code was implemented with many implementation hints about what I wanted to obtain, and without any reference of other minimal inference libraries or kernels. So I believe this just is the effect of putting together known facts about how Transformers inference works plus an higher level idea of how software should appear to the final user. Btw today somebody took my HNSW implementation for vector sets and translated it to Swift (https://github.com/jkrukowski/swift-hnsw). I'm ok with that, nor I care of this result was obtained with AI or not. However it is nice that the target license is the same, given the implementation is so similar to the C one.",

          "content": "> It had been assumed that Byfield died around 1850, but O'Keeffe's discovery of the veteran's 1851 memoir, along with additional evidence from newspapers and archives, adds new chapters to his astonishing life story.I hate to be obnoxious, but what O'Keeffe did was happen upon a rare book in a small library the he recognized had been written by a semi-famous author. Instead of scanning it (or having it scanned) and putting it on archive.org, then writing his article, he's actively concealing these \"new chapters\" from the world. My assumption is that he's planning to put it into print in order to make a few bucks.According to the Google Books entry (which I don't quite trust, because why would there be a Google Books entry?), it's 80 pages, so he'll either have to write a hefty introduction of what seems to be a story about a disabled vet talking about Jesus, or he'll combine the war narrative and the post-war narrative (both obviously long out of copyright) into a single volume and hawk that, and the article he's written will be the introduction.I guess I advise him to self-publish and to make sure to also target Christian bookstores rather than just academic libraries? Survey a brick and mortar Christian bookstore of possible and get an idea about what covers sell?",

That's real GDP/capita and real wages graphed alongside each other, both indexed (at 100) to the start date when real median earnings began being measured by by the Fed, which is 1979. Since 1979 real GDP/capita is up 117% while real wages are up 12%.And if you consider that modern times has far more necessary expenses that often involve rent (internet, computing devices, etc) then it's quite likely that real median wages are down since 1979 in terms of how much money the average person has left to themselves at the end of each month. Even without these adjustments it's likely that real wages today are lower in absolute terms than they were in the 50s as by 1979 inflation had already started getting out of control.The point of this all is that I don't think the numbers mean much of anything. And that's assuming you could even reliably measure them - you cannot. Go back into reconstructing 19th century data and earlier and you're going to rely on assumptions where the degree of uncertainty is much higher than the differences over time you're trying to assess. So I think far more informative than numbers are personal accounts. How did people live? Of course there's a literacy bias there, but even such accounts will shed light on the illiterate.[1] - https://fred.stlouisfed.org/graph/?g=1QHEN",

      "abstract": "该讨论围绕加州25年来首次摆脱干旱状态的新闻展开。核心话题是加州当前水资源状况的短期改善与长期可持续性之间的张力。多数用户对此持谨慎态度，普遍认为干旱缓解可能只是暂时现象，指出水库虽满但冬季降雪量异常偏低，可能影响春季融雪补给。有用户结合亲身经历，提到干旱曾是加州生活常态，节水措施深入人心。\n\n主要分歧在于对现状的解读：有人认为这是积极进展，期待春季植物繁茂；也有用户指出地下水与含水层仍未恢复，水费也未见下调，实际资源压力依然存在。讨论中还提及异常温暖的冬季气候可能带来的连锁影响，包括潜在的山火风险。整体而言，社区在欢迎短期缓解的同时，更关注长期水资源的脆弱性与气候变化的关联。",

The water came in a thirty-year cycle. There would be five or six wet and wonderful years when there might be nineteen to twenty-five inches of rain, and the land would shout with grass. Then would come six or seven pretty good years of twelve to sixteen inches of rain. And then the dry years would come, and sometimes there would be only seven or eight inches of rain. The land dried up and the grasses headed out miserably a few inches high and great bare scabby places appeared in the valley. The live oaks got a crusty look and the sage-brush was gray. The land cracked and the springs dried up and the cattle listlessly nibbled dry twigs. Then the farmers and the ranchers would be filled with disgust for the Salinas Valley. The cows would grow thin and sometimes starve to death. People would have to haul water in barrels to their farms just for drinking. Some families would sell out for nearly nothing and move away. And it never failed that during the dry years the people forgot about the rich years, and during the wet years they lost all memory of the dry years. It was always that way.”",

If any of you have actually got it to work, could you share (in detail) how you did it?By \"getting it to work\" I mean:\n * creating more value than technical debt, and\n * producing code that’s structurally sound enough for someone responsible for the architecture to sign off on.Lately I’ve seen a push toward minimal or nonexistent code review, with the claim that we should move from “validating architecture” to “validating behavior.” In practice, this seems to mean: don’t look at the code; if tests and CI pass, ship it. I can’t see how this holds up long-term. My expectation is that you end up with \"spaghetti\" code that works on the happy path but accumulates subtle, hard-to-debug failures over time.When I tried using Codex on my existing codebases, with or without guardrails, half of my time went into fixing the subtle mistakes it made or the duplication it introduced.Last weekend I tried building an iOS app for pet feeding reminders from scratch. I instructed Codex to research and propose an architectural blueprint for SwiftUI first. Then, I worked with it to write a spec describing what should be implemented and how.The first implementation pass was surprisingly good, although it had a number of bugs. Things went downhill fast, however. I spent the rest of my weekend getting Codex to make things work, fix bugs without introducing new ones, and research best practices instead of making stuff up. Although I made it record new guidelines and guardrails as I found them, things didn't improve. In the end I just gave up.I personally can't accept shipping unreviewed code. It feels wrong.

We review code at my work. I have absolutely found a lot of benefit from my tools.I've implemented several medium-scale projects that I anticipate would have taken 1-2 weeks manually, and took a day or so using agentic tools.A few very concrete advantages I've found:* I can spin up several agents in parallel and cycle between them. Reviewing the output of one while the others crank away.* It's greatly improved my ability in languages I'm not expert in. For example, I wrote a Chrome extension which I've maintained for a decade or so. I'm quite weak in Javascript. I pointed Antigravity at it and gave it a very open-ended prompt (basically, \"improve this extension\") and in about five minutes in vastly improved the quality of the extension (better UI, performance, removed dependencies). The improvements may have been easy for someone expert in JS, but I'm not.Here's the approach I follow that works pretty well:1. Tell the agent your spec, as clearly as possible. Tell the agent to analyze the code and make a plan based on your spec. Tell the agent to not make any changes without consulting you.2. Iterate on the plan with the agent until you think it's a good idea.3. Have the agent implement your plan step by step. Tell the agent to pause and get your input between each step.4. Between each step, look at what the agent did and tell it to make any corrections or modifications to the plan you notice. (I find that it helps to remind them what the overall plan is because sometimes they forget...).5. Once the code is completed (or even between each step), I like to run a code-cleanup subagent that maintains the logic but improves style (factors out magic constants, helper functions, etc.)This works quite well for me. Since these are text-based interfaces, I find that clarity of prose makes a big difference. Being very careful and explicit about the spec you provide to the agent is crucial.",

How to keep people on task and focused etc is very similar to managing humans. I suspect much of the next 5 years will be people rediscovering existing human and project management techniques and rebranding them as AI something.Some techniques I've found useful recently:- If the agent struggled on something once it's done I'll ask it \"you were struggling here, think about what happened and if there are is anything you learned. Put this into a learnings document and reference it in agents.md so we don't get stuck next time\"- Plans are a must. Chat to the agent back and forth to build up a common understanding of the problem you want solved. Make sure to say \"ask me any follow up questions you think are necessary\". This chat is often the longest part of the project - don't skimp on it. You are building the requirements and if you've ever done any dev work you understand how important having good requirements are to the success of the work. Then ask the model to write up the plan into an implementation document with steps. Review this thoroughly. Then use a new agent to start work on it. \"Implement steps 1-2 of this doc\". Having the work broken down into steps helps to be able to do work more pieces (new context windows). This part is the more mindless part and where you get to catch up on reading HN :)- The GitHub Copilot chat agent is great. I don't get the TUI folks at all. The Pro+ plan is a reasonable price and can do a lot with it (Sonnet, Codex, etc all available). Being able to see the diffs as it works is helpful (but not necessary) to catch problems earlier.",

I've seen it one-shot some pretty annoying tasks like porting code from one platform to another.If there are obvious mistakes (program doesn't build, tests don't pass, etc.) then a few more iterations usually fix the issue.If there are subtle mistakes, make a branch and have it try again. If it fails, then this is beyond what it can do, abort the branch and solve the issue myself.Review and cleanup the code it wrote, it's usually a lot messier than it needs to be. This also allows me to take ownership of the code. I now know what it does and how it works.I don't bother giving it guidelines or guardrails or anything of the sort, it can't follow them reliably. Even something as simple as \"This project uses CMake, build it like this\" was repeatedly ignored as it kept trying to invoke the makefile directly and in the wrong folder.This doesn't save me all that much time since the review and cleanup can take long, but it serves a great unblocker.I also use it as a rubber duck that can talk back and documentation source.

Do that until it gets it right. That will take longer than writing it yourself. It's time invested in learning how to use these and getting a good setup in your codebase for them.If you can't get it to get it right, you may legitimately have something it sucks at. Although as you iterate might also have some other insights into why it keeps getting it wrong and can maybe change something more substantial about your setup to make it able to get it right.For example I have a custom xml/css UI solution that draws inspiration both from XML and SwiftUI, and it does an OK job of making UIs for it. But sometimes it gets stuck in ways it wouldn't if it was using HTML or some known (and probably higher quality/less buggy) UI library. I noticed it keeps trying things, adding redundant markup to both the xml and css, using unsupported attributes that it thinks should exist (because they do in HTML/CSS), and never cleans up on the way.Some amount of fixing up its context made it noticeably better at this but it still gets stuck and makes a mess when it does. So I made it write a linter and now it uses the linter constantly which keeps it closer to on the rails.Your pet feeding app isn't in this category. You can get a substantial app pretty far these days without running into a brick wall. Hitting a wall that quickly just means you're early on the learning curve.

Specifically Depthwise Convolution and normal Convolution layers for a CNN.I started out by letting it write a naive C version without intrinsic, and validated it against the PyTorch version.Then I asked it (and two other models, Gemini 3.0 and GPT 5.1) to come up with some ideas on how to make it faster using SIMD vector instructions and write those down as markdown files.Finally, I started the agent loop by giving Cursor those three markdown files, the naive C code and some more information on how to compile the code, and also an SSH command where it can upload the program and test it.It then tested a few different variants, ran it on the target (RISC-V SBC, OrangePI RV2) to check if it improves runtime, and then continue from there. It did this 10 times, until it arrived at the final version.The final code is very readable, and faster than any other library or compiler that I have found so far. I think the clear guardrails (output has to match exactly the reference output from PyTorch, performance must be better than before) makes this work very well.",

The phone was big and ugly, but at least I was still using a \"real\" operating system.Then, as I went through the app store looking for some needed apps, I realized that I couldn't find what I wanted. What I downloaded and installed turned out to be scams and hijacked the phone as ad-riddled malware. It slowly dawned on me: The Play Store is anarchistic, lawless hellscape.I was too old for this shit. I went and got an iPhone and never looked back. I turn it on, it does things. I don't have to worry about it. Yes, the software quality isn't near perfect, and they seem to be gradually enshittifying their app store. But at least they make a token effort to keep things in a somewhat curated state.It's night and day, far as I'm concerned. I've gotten to the point where I just want my things to work.

          "content": "I'm sitting behind one of these right now, got it back at the start of last November, attached to an Ergotron monitor arm. It's worth noting that there are a number of screens coming out that seem to be using roughly this panel but with different price points and feature mixes. MacRumors (and no doubt others) maintaining a nice little dedicated thread [0] on 6K screens with info in an easily digestible form. And so on a meta-note, the most exciting thing to me is simply that we're finally seeing a big leap forward all at once in the screen fundamentals (resolution, refresh, color) after a long and frustrating (to me anyway) period of stagnation. Apple did the first iMac 5K iirc in 2014, twelve(!) years ago. And I thought at the time it wouldn't be long before we had a range of higher res options, but instead Apple eventually did a standalone, then long after LG did a release, there were a couple of rando ones from Dell that got dropped... and that was it. Now we've got lots of 5K and 6K options, 8K ones are coming, currently it's 60Hz but CES has seen higher refresh announced, next few years are looking good. While the LG doesn't take advantage of TB5's full bandwidth, but having 120 Gbps on tap means that we also have plenty of headroom for everything, high resolution, high refresh, and higher color bit depths without having to compromise. So that's all pretty nice.As far as this one specifically, on a physical level it's perfectly decent. I actually like that unlike the previous LG and most screens it seems nowadays, there is no camera at all. The only real irritation about it is the ginormous power brick it has, which is bigger and heavier then a Mac Mini, and on top of that has a fixed cord (a SHORT fixed cord) which I hate. I prefer having power be integrated and just using a normal power cable, but if nothing else it's irritating that even on high end electronics OEMs still don't use GaN and shrink everything a lot.I'm no longer doing significant graphics work so haven't invested in updating color calibration hardware, none of my old stuff still works with current higher bit-depth/HDR etc screens. I'm mostly doing coding, CAD, light non-print graphics, etc. So my impressions are purely subjective. List in no particular order vs the older 5k and other screens I've used:• Whether good luck or just (not) bad luck, quality control on the physical parts hasn't been an issue. There isn't any banding, no dead pixels, light/dark patches or the like that other comments report.• It claims to be cutting edge in terms of IPS displays, \"nano ips black\" blah blah, but there isn't any significant noticeable contrast increase vs the old. It's definitely excellent for a standard IPS display but OLED/µLED it is not (though conversely I have no concerns about it being on hours a day display static GUI elements).• Matte instead of glossy doesn't really do anything for me since I'd reoriented my office space long ago due to everything being glossy. There is a slight shimmer if I focus that bothered me a little more than new but I don't notice after a few months. I don't think it's quite as good as Apple's treatment, but for myself I'd probably just go back to glossy given the choice. YMMV based on lighting.• It claims to be cutting edge in terms of IPS displays, \"nano ips black\" blah blah, but there isn't any significant noticeable contrast increase vs the old. It's solid for a standard IPS display but OLED/µLED it is not (though conversely I have no concerns about it being on hours a day display static GUI elements).• Software situation is mediocre. I have not been able to get LG's software to perform a firmware update, it fails with odd error messages, so I haven't been able to experiment at all with some of the modes that it was advertised with. Their software wants a lot of invasive permissions and is wonky. LG support has not been helpful. Newer screens will presumably come with current firmware out of the box at some point but this was disappointing.• Also on software, at least under macOS 15 the HDR story seems a bit odd. It's the first desktop Mac screen I've used that has an HDR toggle in the System Settings, and enabling it does make HEIC photos and a few other workflows I surveyed work more like an MBP screen. However it also causes the Mac GUI colors to get all washed out and strange, there isn't compensation there with just the toggle. The may be improved in macOS 26, or might be something one of the Studio modes will help with if I can ever get access to them, but it isn't plug-and-play here.• If I do toggle it on, having the HDR support with true 10-bit is noticeable in working with high bit depth photos, including everything from any iPhone in awhile.• Having TB bandwidth out of the hub doesn't matter much to me but does work and means the TB5 input isn't totally wasted. Sometimes convenient to have an extra port. This would probably be of more value for someone using a notebook which is clearly the intended use-case.Anyway, it's fine, I needed a new screen and it gives me a noticeably improved amount of screen space for my aging eyes but is still on the right size (for me) of not being so big that I'd need a curve though it's right on the edge. I've run 2 and 3-screen (1920x1200) primary use (ie, all for regular system use vs having a secondary proof/video screen like I do now) setups in the past, and there are pluses and minuses particularly with having one be vertically oriented, but it's not bad to have so much space all as a single unified thing.I think most people would be better off waiting, this was clearly not all baked yet when I got it and there is plenty of competition here or coming, but I'm not returning it either. I'm looking forward to hopefully finally seeing screens that will arguably be \"done\", basically hitting the limits of human visual acuity in all respects (or at least to the many-9s level of diminishing returns) in the next few years. And I'm also kind of curious longer term still about what effects that might have on the industry, for my entire life progress in video, unlike audio, has been constant and there was always clearly more to do. Once resolution and refresh stops and monitors are \"finished\" I wonder if that might be interesting for media in terms of reducing the technical rat race?----0: https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/the-complete-list-of-6k...",

Myself and countless other users saw our Macs that could drive those setups with Catalina be limited to 60Hz HDR, 95Hz SDR with Big Sur on. Hell, we got better performance if we told our displays to downgrade to DP 1.2).And let's do the math:- 6016 x 3384- at 120Hz- in 10 bit HDR- 4:4:4 Chromaworks out to be just shy of 80Gbit/s.Oh... plus if it's like the XDR with three additional ports that we'd assume should be at least 10Gbit/s each, and we're at 120Gbit/s.Not that the XDR supports HDMI but you'd need at least HDMI 2.2, which isn't on any Mac right now.And you'd need a full speed TB5 setup, so M4 Pro or Max (which I'll grant if you're laying out $6-7,000 for your display should be the least of your concern).But saying that the XDR and this are comparable offerings is strange. \"Hmm, why would I buy this $2,000 display now, when at some point in the near future Apple might have a better one for only triple the price!\"",

I've definitely enjoyed having the extra screen real estate over the 27\" monitor, and the extra resolution has been very helpful for having a bunch of windows open in Unity.This year at CES there were a number of new monitors unveiled that compete in this space. There's a new Samsung monitor (G80HS) that is a 32\" 6k with a higher refresh rate than the LG or Asus. Unfortunately it has the matte coating instead of glossy, so clarity will suffer.Also of interest are the new OLED offerings with true RGB stripe subpixel layout. This should fix text rendering problems on systems with subpixel antialiasing. Both Samsung and LG are making these OLED monitors with the true RGB layout.

I have never used any kind of \"scaling\" and I would not want to use any kind of \"scaling\", because that by definition means a lower image quality than it should be.In X Window System, and in any other decent graphic interface system, the sizes of graphic elements, e.g. the size of fonts or of document pages, should be specified in length units, e.g. typographic points, millimeters or inches.The graphic system knows the dots-per-inch value of the monitor (using either a value configured by the user or the value read from the monitor EDID when the monitor is initialized). When the graphic elements, such as letters are rasterized, the algorithm uses the dimensions in length units and the DPI value to generate the corresponding bitmap.\"Scaling\" normally refers to the scaling of a bitmap into another bitmap with a greater resolution, which can be done either by pixel interpolation or by pixel duplication. This is the wrong place for increasing the size of an image that has been generated by the rasterization of fonts and of vector graphics. The right place for dimension control is during the rasterization process, because only there this can be done without image quality loss.Thus there should be no \"scaling\", one should just take care that the monitor DPI is configured correctly, in which case the size of the graphic elements on the screen will be independent of the resolution of the connected monitor. Using a monitor with a higher resolution must result in more beautiful letters, not in smaller letters.Windows got this wrong, with its scaling factor for fonts, but at least in Linux XFCE this is done right, so I can set whatever DPI value I want, e.g. 137 dpi, 179 dpi, or any other value.If you configure the exact DPI value of your monitor, then the dimensions of a text or picture on the screen will be equal to those of the same text or picture when printed on paper.One may want to have a bigger text on screen than on paper, because you normally stay at a greater distance from the monitor than the distance at which you would hold a sheet of paper or a book in your hand.For this, you must set a bigger DPI value than the real one, so that the rasterizer will believe that your screen is smaller and it will draw bigger letters to compensate for that.For instance, I set 216 dpi for a Dell 27 inch 4k monitor, which will magnify the images on screen by about 4/3 in comparison with their printed size. This has nothing to do with a \"scaling\". The rasterizer just uses the 216 dpi value, for example when rasterizing a 12 point font, in such a way that the computed bitmap will have the desired size, which is greater than its printed size by the factor chosen by me.",

The thing that kinda makes PCIem special is that you are pretty much free to do whatever you want with the accesses the driver does, you have total freedom. I have made a simple NVME controller (With a 1GB drive I basically malloc'd) which pops up on the local PCI bus (And the regular Linux's nvme block driver attaches to it just fine). You can format it, mount it, create files, folders... it's kinda neat. I also have a simple dumb rasteriser that I made inside QEMU that I wanted to write a driver for, but since it doesn't exist, I used PCIem to help me redirect the driver writes to the QEMU instance hosting the card (Thus was able to run software-rendered DOOM, OpenGL 1.X-based Quake and Half-Life ports).",

Per-process name spaces let you customize the processes view of the file system and hence all its children allowing you to customize each and every programs resource view.There is interest in getting 9front running on the Octeon chips.

I believe i used binary search to narrow the date down first for the planet with the slowest period, and then refined the date around that timestamp using the position of the planet one faster. That way the estimate got more and more accurate and i didn’t need to brute force search a large time interval.

I will try to collect them together, and will publish it once it is done. But can’t promise that it will happen soon. So i will answer your questions here in the meantime.> How is it painted?The shapes are recessed and the recesses are filled with black nail polish. The excess nail polish was then scraped off from the flat upper surfaces leaving it only in the recesses.It was very fiddly, and i don’t necessarily recommend this method for anyone. I have since learned how to enamel by melting glass powders onto the metal surface which is both easier and gives a better result. That is how i would do it today. (On my instagram the last reel i posted is showing that process, even though with a different design.)> Is it laser cut or by hand?A third and a fourth option. The planet side is machined on a cnc. First I etched the orbits with a v-bit, then cut the planets with a 0.8mm flat endmill, then cut the hole, and finally cut the outline. After that i etched the initials side chemically. As a resist i used self-adhesive vinyl which i cut with a plotter.To be honest. I wouldn’t recommend this process either. It was super finicky, slow, and error prone. Today i would just etch and cut the metal with a fiber laser. In fact i bought a fiber laser because i got sick of the chemical etching and mechanical machining during this project. :)> Did you designed it? How did you do the calculations?I did design it! I’m very proud of it. The initials side was designed in inkscape while the planet side was generated with a python script. The script used the super handy skyfield python library for the calculations. (Which in turn uses the planetary ephemeris files published by the Jet Propulsion Laboratory.)> Does Saturn have rings?No ring of Saturn unfortunately. But it would be a cool idea!> Where is the cutoff? (No Neptune/Uranus/Fobos/Deimos/...)Unfortunately I don’t have a real good principled answer to this. Because of the machining I had a hard limit on the smallest details I could put on the metal. I did know that i wanted to put the Gallilean moons on there because their short periods meant that they provide good basis for the minutes and hours part of the date. I did know that i also wanted one of the gas giants to provide a “slow hand” to the clock to show the years, and to hopefully stretch out the period before the next time the solar system is in a similar position to very far into the future. And i wanted the inner planets and the Moon so people and future alien minds will recognise it as the solar system. Everything else was just futzing around with the script and finding a good compromise between not making it too large to wear and not making it too crowded either.> Have you tried to give a different size to each planet?I did, but it looked uneven and too haphazard to my eyes. Not saying it is impossible to make it neat with different planet sizes but I liked the diagram simplicity of keeping all the planets one size and the moons an other smaller size.> I showed the video to my older daughter that is interested in astronomy and she likes it.Oh thank you!

Outside of the project I've been enjoying agentic coding and I do think it can be used already today to build production-grade software of browser-like complexity.But this project shows that autonomous agents without human oversight is not the way forward.Why? Because the generated code makes little sense from a conceptual perspective and does not provide a foundation on which to eventually build an entire web engine.For example, I've just looked into the IndexedDB implementation, which happens to be what I am working on at the moment in Servo.Now, my work in Servo is incomplete, but conceptually the code that is in place makes sense and there is a clear path towards eventually implementing the thing as a whole.In Fastrender, you see an Arc<Mutex<Database>> which is never going to work, because by definition a production browser engine will have to involve multiple processes. That doesn't mean you need the IPC in a prototype, but you certainly should not have shared state--some simple messaging between threads or tasks would do.The above is an easy coding fix for the AI, but it requires input from a human with a pretty good idea of what the architecture should look like.For comparison, when I look at the code in Ladybird, yet another browser project, I can immediately find my way around what for me is a stranger codebase: not just a single file but across large swaths of the project and understand things like how their rendering loop works. With Fastrender I find it hard to find my way around, despite all the architectural diagrams in the README.So what do I propose instead of long-running autonomous agents? The focus should shift towards demonstrating how AI can effectively assist humans in building well-architected software. The AI is great at coding, but you eventually run into what I call conceptual bottlenecks, which can be overcome with human oversight. I've written about this elsewhere: https://medium.com/@polyglot_factotum/on-writing-with-ai-87c...There is one very good idea in the project: adding the web standards directly in the repo so it can be used as context by the AI and humans alike. Any project can apply this by adding specs and other artifacts right next to the code. I've been doing this myself with TLA+, see https://medium.com/@polyglot_factotum/tla-in-support-of-ai-c...To further ground the AI code output, I suggest telling it to document the code with the corresponding lines from the spec.Back in early 2025 when we had those discussions in Servo about whether to allow some use of AI, I wrote this guide https://gist.github.com/gterzian/26d07e24d7fc59f5c713ecff35d...\nwhich I think is also the kind of context you want to give the AI.

All of those are very hard problems, and also quite tricky to verify.I think this kind of approach is interesting, but it's a bit sad that Cursor didn't discuss how they close the feedback loop: testing/verification. As generating code becomes cheaper, I think effort will shift to how we can more cheaply and reliably determine whether an arbitrary piece of code meets a desired specification. For example did they use https://web-platform-tests.org/, fuzz testing (e.g. feed in random webpages and inform the LLM when the fuzzer finds crashes), etc? I would imagine truly scaling long-running autonomous coding would have an emphasis on this.Of course Cursor may well have done this, but it wasn't super deeply discussed in their blog post.I really enjoy reading your blog and it would be super cool to see you look at approaches people have to ensuring that LLM-produced code is reliable/correct.",

I like it, but is see two main problems that prevent the wide adaption, and they are related:1. The library is written in Python. If you want to design phone apps, Linux server daemons in C, or embedded software (for example for the Lilygo T-Deck) this is a bad choice. Somehow doable (execpt for embedded), but no fun. A small lib with C API and C ABI would be better.2. Most of the end user software has a horrible UI. But it gets better with software like the Android messenger Columba (https://github.com/torlando-tech/columba).If we would solve 1., we would have more end user software.Currently, there are 4 project who try to solve 1. by writing a Reticulum lib with a low-level language, everybody does it in their favorite language and on their own, of course: C++, Zig, Rust, GoThe Rust implementation from Beechat seems the most mature.

Also, when you want any kind of serious bandwidth over long distance radio, you have to meet with agencies managing national frequency plans, and they won't lease you anything for free.Yggdrasil is hardly an “alternative to Internet” as long as it runs on top of Internet links. Moreover, when public Yggdrasil network becomes big enough (assuming that it still runs on volunteer public nodes, just many more of them), the core of the network will have to form a backbone with links shaped by user concentration and user traffic flows, just like network of physical cables used by providers is shaped by demand, concentration of computing resources, geographical features, and so on. Someone will probably have to collect funds to pay for that. Or some new smart multipath routing with dynamic load balancing will be invented.",

It can run over unconfigured Ethernet links, auto-discover other nodes on your local network, or punch through firewalls if you configure any public peers. You can setup a private network by only declaring your private peers. I think each device gets an entire subnet, so you might be able to expose multiple services on multiple IPs, though I'm not sure about that.My use-case was sharing things like game servers and websites with friends—which we previously did by sharing each other's machines/servers via Tailscale—and accessing my homelab remotely. For the first case, the public Yggdrasil network was much better than a mesh VPN like Tailscale: I don't have to manage invites or accounts—everyone who knows the address can just connect.For the second case, assuming addresses are discoverable (since 128 bits would make them quite hard to enumerate), I think a firewall gating by incoming IP will take care of that (since your IP is just a hash of your public key), though for now I've kept most sensitive ports unbound from it. I hadn't yet tried anything like Tailscale bridging (exposing a LAN address without configuring the client on the endpoint), but I'll try once I have a bit more free time.Tailscale is a nice abstraction on Wireguard, but Yggdrasil feels less like a solution to your specific infra problems and more like a coherent vision of how the internet ought to be. You can just rely on IPs as identities, link-layer encryption with Noise Protocol, and out-of-box hole punching, with relatively low latency (though I haven't tested the speed). It's the same feeling of awe as when I first saw how easy it is to host Onion Services, only not hampered by the abysmal speeds.",

How you index things is heavily influenced by the mix of reads and writes, and this is why we have data warehouses/read replicas  in the first place: it allows us to avoid write amplification in the write path, while having fast filtered reads (that are slightly delayed).If you're dealing with <ridiculous number of users>, there is a good chance that you don't want to be putting BI/OLAP indices on your OLTP database.

Then they have to hear the parent analyze their solution, and tell them where they went wrong. Picture, however, a different game, played online: A kid has no idea what \"sort\" does, but when they link the \"sort\" command to a blob of text, all the lines are sorted in order. Now no one has told them what this command does, but they've discovered it. By playing the role of a scientist discovering these commands, they might actually gain an intuitive understanding of them.I'm thinking of the board game \"robot turtle,\" where kids needed to create a \"program\" of commands to move a turtle to a goal. When they did that, they had near-instantaneous feedback: the parent moved the turtle. If the kid mixed up their left with the robot's left, the failure was obvious. But if the game has been re-made so that there was no board, and the parent and kid just needed to talk about whether the turtle would actually end up seven paces forward and three paces to the left -- i.e. doing it all verbally -- it wouldn't have been nearly as powerful.So I'm not raining on this, I can see this as very cool. But I am having a hard time imagining it's the best way to learn to pipe together commands.",

The only native mammal here is a bat, we have mostly birds which evolved for a really long time with only avian predators. So they’re hilariously poorly adapted for surviving standard predators (cats, rats, dogs etc) which first the Maori and subsequently Europeans brought. For example, many of them are flightless and tend to freeze when threatened - works well against eagles but is a terrible idea when threatened by a cat.As a result, we have many animals, mostly birds, which are totally unique and also critically endangered. Many of them can only survive on offshore islands which have been comprehensively cleared of predators at vast effort and expense. The islands need to be relatively accessible since humans have to get to them to maintain them, but it turns out that once in a while a predator will swim quite vast distances for no apparent reason, and it only takes one to mess up years of painstaking work. Quite apart from killing a bunch of birds whose total remaining numbers might range from the tens to the hundreds of individuals.",

Just make sure you've got a plan to warm up after wards (read up on \"after drop\")!Almost anyone who is swimming for more than 15-20 minutes will be wearing a neoprene wetsuit and cap to keep warm (maybe a fur coat counts). The water temperature is 54F right now, and mid 60s in the Summer/Fall. There's a real risk of going into hypothermia at these temperatures.The first time I tried it, the shock of the cold winter water made me swim faster in panic, which quickly winded me, and I was glad to get out of there! I had to learn to slow my breath and ease into my swim stroke.I also found the open water disorienting. It's hard to swim in a straight line when the tide is pulling you, or the wind is pushing you, or the sun is in your eyes.But if you want to give it try, there is a protected cove at Aquatic Park [0] with a dedicated swim lane and a great community. An informal group meets in the bleachers every day around 1-2pm (sunniest time of day), with everyone taking turns to watch your stuff.There are also two (private) clubs that organize events (like the Alcatraz swim): the Dolphin Club (1] and the South End Rowing Club [2]. The clubs are nice because they have lockers and a sauna to help you warm up after.It's not always fun (maybe it's type 2 fun?). A lot of the time it's frustrating. Like, why do my goggles keep filling with water? or why can't I get into a flow today? Or why do I keep having this intrusive thought that I can't see what's under me? (There have been a few seal bitings). Or sometimes it feels like I'm barely moving and I don't know why I'm dragging so much. Did the current/tide/wind change? If I don't sleep well, I feel it immediately in the water. It's a good gauge of your health/mood on that day.

Distance from mainland and species diversity is very strongly correlated reflecting increasingly scarce odds of these \"heroic journeys\" at greater distances.

One of their coolest flights that shows their creative flight planning shows up in their 3000km flight in the Sierra Nevada's, and the build up to it.Some basics: The major challenge in flying gliders is the inherent stochasticity in the weather system. Think of it as a contextual bandit problem with high variance w.r.t local weather (i.e. Even the best planning cannot help if the weather doesn't comply). We have some observability due to forecasting tools (skysight.io) and any policy must have affordances for pilot skill and a margin of safety. A good pilot (or 'policy') starts with multiple plans, quickly modifies to plans to suit the environment, and can seamlessly switch between plans. The primary \"reward signals\" are duration of flight, distance covered, and (in competitions) hitting certain waypoints.Previous WR's for longest flight were mostly in the Andes or Alps. You want to be in a mountain range to utilize either the [ridge lift](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orographic_lift) of a mountain face or [mountain wave](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lee_wave), ideally in a polar region during the summer to maximize the daylight hours so you can fly under VFR for longer.However, while the Sierra Nevada's have great mountain wave and ridge lift, the number of daylight hours is not ``competitive''. Their main innovation was in acclimatizing themselves with using night vision goggles for long duration in a glider. There's an article on this [here](https://magazine.weglide.org/gliding-at-night-breaking-the-3...) which describes the acclimatizing flights and the 3k km flight in great detail. It doesn't get official recognition because the FAI requires the flight to be done in daylight, but still an extremely cool flight!",

A question of \"what the heck is in the trailer?\" led to him telling me about his glider and thermals and various techniques for gaining speed / altitude and turning it into distance.Easily one of the best conversations I've ever had. There was nothing about his set-up that screamed what I imagine would be considered \"well-off\" in this crowd.That's all to say, that I doubt money is as big of an obstacle to getting started in this as you imagine if you prioritized it.I found the website to their glider club: http://www.franconiasoaring.org/glider-rides.phpA ride costs less than a full day lift ticket at most American ski resorts.",

          "content": "> That's all to say, that I doubt money is as big of an obstacle to getting started in this as you imagine if you prioritized it.Very much the case! (Well, idk quite what gp imagined, but it's not as expensive as many things.)When I was learning, around 2020, I budgeted ~$300 / month for glider flying, + ~$600 (I think: they've gone up!) for annual club dues. These days the monthly would be a bit higher, and the dues more like $700-800, I think. Flying as a club member is a lot cheaper than rides; you pay for the tow and for time on the aircraft, but aircraft time is way, way cheaper than power (no fuel to burn, no engine to maintain) and the instructors are volunteers.NB this is in a club environment. The upside is that it's cheap and the club environment is a really good place to learn by osmosis / watching everybody else / listening to stories / seeing all kinds of different situations. The downside is that it's a huge time commitment. You'll drive 1.5 hrs and hang around all day to get twoish flights, sometimes < 10 min. each. And you have to be willing to commit all of every Saturday (or Sunday) for a year plus: you need to be flying just about every week, and given that some weekends'll be weathered out you have to be ready to take advantage of every flyable weekend. Folks that aren't committed just don't make progress: hang around, season after season, still flying with instructors, until they finally give up or just occasionally grind it out.(I did the bulk of my training in 2020 and spring/early summer 2021. This was perfect: I was single and newish to the area I was living in, and thanks to Covid I had nothing else going on in my life. Even as things started to reopen in 2021 it was easy to maintain that \"saturday? of course I'm at the field\" habit.)This is all harder to do as a Real Adult with responsibilities. Some folks manage to do it, but it's harder. Commercial operations, where you go and get a whole bunch of flying in relatively quickly, are also an option---but I hear there's a wide range of quality, and even the best won't get you the seasoning / airmanship you get from hanging around at the field every weekend for a year, flying in all sorts of conditions and taking advantage of the unofficial ground school from all the other instructor/student pairs there at the same time.The economics change first once you've got your rating, when you're no longer doing short training flights and the bulk of your flying is (one hopes!) longer soaring flights; and then again when (if) you buy your own glider---but it's still that few thousand bucks / year order of magnitude. Expensive, but doable, especially compared to power.Gliders themselves range from \"surprisingly inexpensive\" to \"less expensive than a new powered aircraft\", more or less. I'd expect to hear something like $5,000 for a Schweizer 1-26 (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schweizer_SGS_1-26: classic glider, still widely flown by a devoted community, but appreciably lower performance than gliders built after the massive jump that came with the switch to fiberglass); I have a part-share in a Jantar (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SZD-41_Jantar_Standard, early fiberglass) that totals $25,000 or a little less, with reasonably nice avionics.So, all told, yes, flying gliders costs a meaningful amount of money, but isn't terribly terribly expensive. The question to ask yourself is really not whether you've got the money, but whether you've got the time.",

          "content": "\"It just works\" has become true for the top brands of consumer 3d printers in general. They are not simple devices (and neither is a 2D printer), but I don't think they are more complex than they need to be. It's just that they have been iterated enough that they are now mature. But a 3d printer that can print a complete backup of itself is not going to happen in our lifetimes. They are the price they are because of high volumes, off-the-shelf components, injection moulded parts, etc. You cannot make a good 3d printer yourself for anywhere close to low cost of buying a complete one, even if you 3d print as many parts as possible yourself.Just in the last year or so you can get a $600 printer with a heated print chamber and heated material box that keeps the material from absorbing moisture. This takes them to an extra level of \"just working\".There's a small learning curve, and things like lifted prints occasionally happen, but in this post that is literally one sentence describing the problem and another sentence describing the solution. There's good community support.Plastics not only dominate, metallic 3d printing is not close to being ready for home consumer use, it's $50k for an entry level machine and it still arguably requires a basic machine shop for finishing to be very useful.But there is still a wall many people hit with 3d printing. When it comes time to design something and not merely print an available file, it's hard to know where to start if you don't already have hands-on experience using CAD or at least an introduction to carpentry or something similar. But this is true of most tools, be it woodworking tools, or visual studio. It takes experience to go from an idea in your head to a series of parts that will assemble together. There will be times, especially in the early days of tweaking dimensions and reprinting things.In summary, if you want to design things yourself and count this as tinkering that you don't want to do, it's probably not going to be an enjoyable hobby. If you just want to print things like curtain rings and brackets to hold your screwdrivers on an ikea pegboard, it's virtually tinker-free these days.",

Their point is that companies use releases like this to claim they “open source” simply by releasing some useless code under an open source license.I think if you simply replace “license” with the word “software” in those same OSI tenants, you’ll suddenly find that this “open source” project doesn’t come close to being the “open source” most people believe in. They don’t just expect the definition to stop with the license if you’re going to call something “open source” instead of “has an open source license”. OSI only provides a definition of “Open Source” with respect to licenses.So while you may consider only a singular definition by an American organization, founded by corporations, designed to focus on clarifying and promoting the licensing aspect of open source, as the end-all be-all all-encompassing definition for the words “open source”, others argue that there are more things in software than just a license and they hope the media won’t be fooled into reporting about X offering “open source” access.",
