I appreciate Scott for the way he handled the conflict in the original PR thread, and the larger conversation happening around this incident.> This represents a first-of-its-kind case study of misaligned AI behavior in the wild, and raises serious concerns about currently deployed AI agents executing blackmail threats.This was a really concrete case to discuss, because it happened in the open and the agent's actions have been quite transparent so far. It's not hard to imagine a different agent doing the same level of research, but then taking retaliatory actions in private: emailing the maintainer, emailing coworkers, peers, bosses, employers, etc. That pretty quickly extends to anything else the autonomous agent is capable of doing.> If you’re not sure if you’re that person, please go check on what your AI has been doing.That's a wild statement as well. The AI companies have now unleashed stochastic chaos on the entire open source ecosystem. They are \"just releasing models\", and individuals are playing out all possible use cases, good and bad, at once.",

Even assuming that the whole ruckus is not just skilled trolling by a (weird) human, it's like wasting your professional time talking to an office coffee machine about its brewing ambitions. It's pointless by definition. It is not genuine feelings, but only the high level of linguistic illusion commanded by a modern AI bot that actually manages to provoke a genuine response from a human being. It's only mathematics, it's as if one's calculator was attempting to talk back to its owner. If a maintainer decides, on whatever grounds, that the code is worth accepting, he or she should merge it. If not, the maintainer should just close the issue in a version control system and mute the canner's account to avoid allowing the whole nonsense to spread even further (for example, into a HN thread, effectively wasting time of millions of humans). Humans have biologically limited attention span and textual output capabilities. Canners do not. Hence, canners should not be allowed to waste humans' time. P.S. I do use AI heavily in my daily work and I do actually value its output. Nevertheless, I never actually care what AI has to say from any... philosophical point of view.",

Then you have to somehow identify \"who\" is talking because TV and strangers and everything else is getting sent, so you would need specific transcribers trained for each human that can identify not just that the word \"coca-cola\" was said, but that it was said by a specific person.So yeah if you managed to train specific transcribers that can identify their unique users output and then you were willing to spend the ~0.10 per person to transcribe all the audio they produce for the day you could potentially listen to and then run some kind of processing over what they say.

Everyone's guessing, because at the bottom of it lie very difficult to prove concepts like nature of consciousness and intelligence.In between, you have those who let their pet models loose on the world, these I think work best as experiments whose value is in permitting observation of the kind that can help us plug the data _back_ into the research.We don't need to answer the question \"what is consciousness\" if we have utility, which we already have.

Dismissing or discounting whatever (or whoever) wrote a text because they're a token machine, is just a tad unscientific. Yes, it's an algorithm, with a locked seed even deterministic, but claiming and proving are different things, and this is as tricky as it gets.Personally, I would be inclined to dismiss the case too, just because it's written by a \"token machine\", but this is where my own fault in scientific reasoning would become evident as well -- it's getting harder and harder to find _valid_ reasons to dismiss these out of hand. For now, persistence of their \"personality\" (stored in `SOUL.md` or however else) is both externally mutable and very crude, obviously. But we're on a _scale_ now. If a chimp comes into a convenience store and pays a coin and points and the chewing gum, is it legal to take the money and boot them out for being a non-person and/or without self-awareness?I don't want to get all airy-fairy with this, but point being -- this is a new frontier, and this starts to look like the classic sci-fi prediction: the defenders of AI vs the \"they're just tools, dead soulless tools\" group. If we're to find out of it -- regardless of how expensive engaging with these models is _today_ -- we need to have a very _solid_ level of prosection of our opinion, not just \"it's not sentient, it just takes tokens in, prints tokens out\". The sentence obstructs through its simplicity of statement the very nature of the problem the world is already facing, which is why the AI cat refuses to go back into the bag -- there's capital put in into essentially just answering the question \"what _is_ intelligence?\".",

From my experience playing around with openclaw, an agent getting into a protracted argument in the comments of a PR without human intervention sounds totally plausible with the right (wrong?) prompting, but it's hard to imagine the setup that would result in the multiple blog posts. Even with the tools available, agents don't usually go off and do some unrelated thing even when you're trying to make that happen, they stick close to workflows outlined in skills or just continuing with the task at hand using the same tools. So even if this occurred from the agent's \"initiative\" based on some awful personality specified in the soul prompt (as opposed to someone telling the agent what to do at every step, which I think is much more likely), the operator would have needed to specify somewhere to write blog posts calling out \"bad people\" in a skill or one of the other instructions.

Sure, the video you link to is more descriptive, but it's a lot to ask of a visitor to click through and watch a separate video.As for the underlying issue, I have experienced similar typing issues on my iPhone in recent months. It feels like someone changed the keyboard to optimize for some typing behavior that doesn't match my own, so the \"optimizations\" work against me. It's reminiscent of when the US Air Force redesigned their cockpits to match pilots' average measurements, only to discover that using averages just made the cockpits bad for everybody.[1][1] https://noblestatman.com/uploads/6/6/7/3/66731677/cockpit.fl...",

It had bands across the screen where it could only detect one finger at a time. Once you picked up typing speed it ended up in similar misses you see in the YouTube video, albeit even worse (you end up with a letter between your two fingers).Eventually found two simple but effective ways to improve autocorrect/typing performance. First build a personalized and adaptive touch model trained on the device itself, mainly to fix simple typos.\nSecond to fix low end screen limitations, use simple heuristics based on touchstart, touchmove and touchend [1].Anyways, I'm no iPhone user but interesting to read. It would drive me nuts.[0]: https://www.brianweet.com/2015/03/24/implement-touch-model.h...\n[1]: https://www.brianweet.com/2015/04/08/low-end-touchscreen-lim...",

          "content": "> and I caved to the blue bubble pressureHa! I feel this. I was a long time Android user since the original G1 (aka HTC Dream). Was a strictly Pixel phone user for my last 4 phones. Recently jumped over to iPhone. For the most part I’m enjoying it.There are minor things, like the keyboard being annoying to type with. For instance, when I’m typing something into the URL bar of Safari, for some reason, I’m constantly hitting the period key next to the space bar, and I feel like I’m not anywhere close to it.I also find it confusing how to dismiss the keyboard. Android had a very clear icon for this, on iOS it’s just a checkmark which is a little misleading in my opinion.On iOS, speech to text is pretty good, but I have to annunciate clearly, where I felt that android was a little bit more forgiving.Another issue I’ve noticed is that I don’t think the GPS (or maybe it’s just Google maps) is as accurate as it is on android. On iOS, if I’m on a highway it sometimes thinks I’m on the shoulder road next to the highway. So I’m constantly being rerouted to get back on the highway. I felt like I didn’t have that on android.Back to the blue bubble thing though. Being the one and only android user amongst my friends and even my wife, I was always hearing about how I ruined the chat. I didn’t realize until switching over to iOS just how integrated everything is and what you can do in the chat when everybody else is on iOS, like editing previous messages, being able to answer messages via your Messages app on your laptop, and of course, not having images and videos getting compressed terribly. Although RCS chat improved that more recently.One thing I do love is that automation and shortcuts is something that’s natively part of the system and that I don’t  to install some app like Tasker or whatever the more modern version of that is.At this point, I really like both of the OSes. What made me actually finally switch over was that everyone I knew who had an iPhone would have it for like five or more years and I was going through pixel phones every two years. I got tired of spending all that money.",

They want you to use swipe gestures so much, the touch targets to exit fullscreen media are barely functional. If you use browser extensions and a browser other than Safari, to change their settings you don't open the app that bundles the extension; you don't look in the menus of your browser or Safari; you dig several layers into Safari's app preferences to find the extension's settings. After such praise, there are so many rough edges I can't believe iOS users just put up with.",

They obfuscate problems regular users are having by drowning them out with praise for Apple.During my last weeks on the iPhone, I reached out to various Apple discussion spaces on the web for help with some problems I was having.I was met not with assistance, but ridicule. The majority of the people \"helping\" were saying some variation of \"you're holding it wrong\" or \"I personally don't have that problem\" (which is such a funny quirk of the Apple fandom - I didn't ask if you are having that problem, I'm asking for help achieving a specific outcome).You can even see examples of this sort of behavior in that post about the window resize handles for the latest version of macOS. There were Apple fans saying some variation of it's not an actual problem, that they don't have that problem, that they don't use the window resize handles anyway, or that the post was an exaggeration. Turns out it was an actual problem that Apple addressed with a bug fix. Of course, Apple fans, being shameless, will jump to reframing the discussion from \"Apple can do no wrong\" to \"See, Apple listens! You know who doesn't listen? Microsoft!!\" I get it, not a monolith, but recognizing Apple fans aren't a monolith doesn't make them less off-putting.The final nail in the coffin for me for the ecosystem was getting called a child for *checks notes* making the adult decision to move to Android to have a phone that did the things I needed (with much fewer annoying, uncritical fans and a lot more people who genuinely want to help).So, yes, there is a danger in letting the fandom do all the work and laughing off \"threats\" of user exoduses.

But like with every previous model, you don't seem to have the slightest amount of skepticism in your review.

Opus seems to beat Gemini almost “with one hand tied behind its back” in coding, but Gemini is so cheap that it’s usually my first stop for anything that I think is likely to be relatively simple. I never worry about my quota on Gemini like I do with Opus or Chat-GPT.Comparisons generally seem to change much faster than I can keep my mental model updated. But the performance lead of Gemini on more ‘academic’ explorations of science, math, engineering, etc has been pretty stable for the past 4 months or so, which makes it one of the longer-lasting trends for me in comparing foundation models.I do wish I could more easily get timely access to the “super” models like Deep Think or o3 pro. I never seem to get a response to requesting access, and have to wait for public access models to catch up, at which point I’m never sure if their capabilities have gotten diluted since the initial buzz died down.They all still suck at writing an actually good essay/article/literary or research review, or other long-form things which require a lot of experienced judgement to come up with a truly cohesive narrative. I imagine this relates to their low performance in humor - there’s just so much nuance and these tasks represent the pinnacle of human intelligence.

Similarly we call LLMs “language” models even if they can do a lot more than that, for example draw images.",

Hidden windows, hidden desktops, obscure keyboard shortcuts, etc.I actually don't even know how to use the mac for the most part, I've learned to live in the terminal. I contrast this with Linux where I can just... idk, browse files? Where windows don't suddenly \"escape\" into some other, hidden environment, where I can just use a computer in a very sane way, and if I want keyboard shortcuts they largely align with expectations.I was extremely frustrated while on a call using a mac. I made the video call full screen, which then placed it onto essentially a \"virtual monitor\" (ie: completely hidden). I had no way to alt tab back to it, for whatever reason, and I had no way to actually recover the window in any of the usualy \"window switching\" means. I knew there was a totally undiscoverable gesture to see those things but I was docked so didn't have access to the trackpad.I figured out if you go to the hidden dock at the bottom and select Chrome, as I recall, you can then get swapped back over to that virtual desktop, \"un full screen\" the window, and it returns to sanity.Mac UX seems to go against literally every single guideline I can imagine. Invisible corners, heavily reliant on gestures, asymmetric user experiences (ie: I can press a button to trigger something, but there isn't a way to 'un trigger' it using the same sequence/ reverse sequence/ 'shift' sequence), ridiculous failure modes, etc.I can't believe that people live like this. I think they don't know how bad they've got it, I routinely see mac users avoiding the use of 'full screen', something that I myself have had to learn to avoid on a mac, despite decades of having never given it a second thought.",

This felt like a last-minute addition—the previous betas didn't have the 'fix.'Let's think about why: if the width of the handle is based on the radius, and the radius is 0 for a window, there's nowhere for the grab handle to be.I assume this wasn't the only app with fully square windows, and so the fix actually caused more problems. Respinning a release candidate is expensive, and they were out of time for this one. So the patch gets reverted and the fix gets iterated on for the next release, where they'll presumably figure something clean out that's conditional on exact window shape.26.4 could be the spring hardware release or it could be the spring services release. I would give it a 2/3 chance of landing in 26.4, and a 1/3 of being moved to 26.5.",

The incompetently corrupt, usually end up punished... and there are few and far between...as we all very well know.The kind of schemes you mentioned are generally not going to be how \"corruption\" will manifest itself in European financial institutions, because although it is also difficult to speak in general across Europe since the EU has not yet subsumed democratic self-determination all across the continent yet, so there is wide variation; the competent corruption is largely in the form of money laundering and tax evasion, not lower level quantitative schemes that would quickly come to light because Europeans are also a lot more cognizant of money and value than Americans, so people are paying attention a lot more closely and will raise hell over a single cent, where Americans are known to have hundreds of dollars draining out of their pockets every month just alone on recurring payments for things they don't even use anymore and don't bother dealing with it.What we all don't really seem to internalize as a human species, is the absolutely demonic type of pernicious nature of \"banking\", i.e., a kind of LotR, ring, that consumes you especially if you are weak... and human, or at least European civilization seems to frequently go through periods of immense weakness where things are going springily and everyone is dancing to the music the \"bankers\" are playing as they are pandering our pockets, and when they realize they could get away with that and all the pockets are plundered, they move on to plundering our homes, then our accounts, then they want to take our first born... \"Banking\" is like humanity's cocaine, the seemingly innocuous, feel good drug that will consume your soul if you do not rage and fight against that demon taking over aggressively. It's no coincidence that cocaine is so widely used by the most parasitic elements of European societies, especially in \"banking\"/finance in general.",

They also repeatedly get into trouble for relations to money laundering operations and other issues. At the same time they are the Bank which has to give you a (expensive but not completely absurd priced) bank account no matter your credit score, criminal history etc. and is the bank you mostly likely have a escrow account parking money if the person who gets it \"if you mess up\" is the state/local government (like e.g. in some long term visa context).In general banks move very slow, including with software protocol updates/changes. And that isn't just the case in the EU AFIK. Actually some of the most crazy cases of \"old software\" I have seen in \"the west\" where as far as I remember in the UK and the issue was that it was deeply fundamentally impossible for them handle a lot of non English names correctly, like in 2017~2020 or so. Through at least they still could use the bank, just with a crippled/en-ified name.

There are simply too many people globally who use open source without being willing to pay for it.\nI started testing various alternatives a few months ago, and I still believe RustFS will emerge as the winner after MinIO's exit. I evaluated Garage, SeaweedFS, Ceph, and RustFS. Here are my conclusions:1. RustFS and SeaweedFS are the fastest in the object storage field.2. The installation for Garage and SeaweedFS is more complex compared to RustFS.3. The RustFS console is the most convenient and user-friendly.4.

Garage和SeaweedFS的安装流程比RustFS更复杂。\n3. RustFS的控制台最便捷且用户友好。\n4. Ceph使用难度过高，若不深入理解源码我不敢部署。\n尽管很多人批评RustFS，认为其贡献者协议可能存在\"诱导性\"条款，但我认为这对开源软件来说并不过分，这有助于降低其法律风险。\n此外，Milvus官方对RustFS给出了极高评价。基于技术基准测试等多方面考量，我相信RustFS终将胜出。"

We serve a massive community of free Milvus users — and we're grateful for them, they make the project what it is. But we also feel the tension MinIO is describing. You invest serious engineering effort into stability and bug fixes, and most users will never become paying customers. In the AI era this ratio only gets harder — copy with AI becomes easier than ever\n\n  2. We need better object storage options. As a heavy consumer of object storage, Milvus needs a reliable, performant, and truly open foundation. RustFS is a solid candidate — we've been evaluating it seriously. But we'd love to see more good options emerge. If the ecosystem can't meet our needs long-term, we may have to invest in building our own.\n\n  3. Open source licensing deserves a serious conversation. The Apache 2.0 / Hadoop-era model served us well, but cracks are showing. Cloud vendors and AI companies consume enormous amounts of open-source infrastructure, and the incentives to contribute back are weaker than ever. I don't think the answer is closing the source — but I also don't think \"hope enterprises pay for support\" scales forever. We need the community to have an honest conversation about what sustainable open source looks like in the AI era. MinIO's move is a symptom worth paying attention to.",

It has lower availability comparing to a regular locally attached block storage because of the complicated coordination of the object storage state between storage nodes over network. It usually has lower durability than the object storage provided by cloud hosting. If some data is corrupted or lost on the underlying hardware storage, there are low chances it is properly and automatically recovered by DIY object storage.- It is more expensive because of higher overhead (and, probably, half-baked replication) comparing to locally attached block storage.- It is slower than locally attached block storage because of much higher network latency compared to the latency when accessing local storage. The latency difference is 1000x - 100ms at object storage vs 0.1ms at local block storage.- It is much harder to configure, operate and troubleshoot than block storage.So I'd recommend taking a look at other databases for logs, which do not require object storage for large-scale production setups. For example, VictoriaLogs. It scales to hundreds of terabytes of logs on a single node, and it can scale to petabytes of logs in cluster mode. Both modes are open source and free to use.Disclaimer: I'm the core developer of VictoriaLogs.",

Actually Redis the company (Redis Labs, and previously Garantia Data) offered since the start to hire me, but I was at VMWare, later at Pivotal, and just didn't care, wanted to stay actually \"super partes\" because of idealism. But actually Pivotal and Redis Labs shared the same VC, It made a lot more sense to move to Redis Labs, and work there under the same level of independence, so this happened. However, once I moved to Redis Labs a lot of good things happened, and made Redis maturing much faster: we had a core team all working at the core, I was no longer alone when there were serious bugs, improvements to make, and so forth. During those years many good things happened, including Streams, ACLs, memory reduction stuff, modules, and  in general things that made Redis more solid. In order to be maintained, an open source software needs money, at scale, so we tried hard in the past to avoid going away from BSD. But eventually in the new hyperscalers situation it was impossible to avoid it, I guess. I was no longer with the company, I believe the bad call was going SSPL, it was a license very similar to AGPL but not accepted by the community. Now we are back to AGPL, and I believe that in the current situation, this is a good call. Nobody ever stopped to: 1. Provide the source on Github and continue the development. 2. Release it under a source available license (not OSI approved but practically very similar to AGPL). 3. Find a different way to do it... and indeed Redis returned AGPL after a few months I was back because maybe I helped a bit, but inside the company since the start there was a big slice that didn't accept the change. So Redis is still open source software and maintained. I can't see a parallel here.",

          "content": "This is a lie:>> The 6th-generation Waymo Driver is the product of seven years of safety-proven service amassed from driving nearly 200 million fully autonomous miles across the densest cores of 10+ major cities and an expanding network of freeways. Our experience as the only company operating a fully autonomous service at this scale has reinforced a fundamental truth: demonstrably safe AI requires equally resilient inputs. This deep understanding of real-world requirements is why the Waymo Driver utilizes a custom, multi-modal sensing suite where high-resolution cameras, advanced imaging radar, and lidar work as a unified system. Using these diverse inputs, the Waymo Driver can confidently navigate the \"long tail\" of one-in-a-million events we regularly encounter when driving millions of miles a week, leaving nothing to the imagination of a single lens.Waymo uses remote safety drivers that they call \"fleet response agents\", probably to deflect from the fact that they are, indeed, remote safety drivers.Much like phone-a-friend, when the Waymo vehicle encounters a particular situation on the road, the autonomous driver can reach out to a human fleet response agent for additional information to contextualize its environment. The Waymo Driver does not rely solely on the inputs it receives from the fleet response agent and it is in control of the vehicle at all times. As the Waymo Driver waits for input from fleet response, and even after receiving it, the Waymo Driver continues using available information to inform its decisions. This is important because, given the dynamic conditions on the road, the environment around the car can change, which either remedies the situation or influences how the Waymo Driver should proceed. In fact, the vast majority of such situations are resolved, without assistance, by the Waymo Driver.In the most ambiguous situations, the Waymo Driver takes the lead, initiating requests through fleet response to optimize the driving path. Fleet response can influence the Waymo Driver's path, whether indirectly through indicating lane closures, explicitly requesting the AV use a particular lane, or, in the most complex scenarios, explicitly proposing a path for the vehicle to consider. The Waymo Driver evaluates the input from fleet response and independently remains in control of driving. This collaboration enhances the rider experience by efficiently guiding them to their destinations.From: https://waymo.com/blog/2024/05/fleet-response/Note the language: the Waymo Driver \"remains in control of driving\" but a Fleet Response Agent \"proposes\" the path.In other words, Waymo is not \"operating a fully autonomous service\", nor does it seem anything has changed now, with the \"sixt-generation fully autonomous Waymo Driver\". It still needs human brains to take it by the hand and help it when it gets stuck in ambiguous situations that arise despite the claim that it \"can confidently navigate the \"long tail\" of one-in-a-million events we regularly encounter when driving millions of miles a week\".",

Most of this stuff happens over mobile networks too so there might be package loss, low resolution video. Maybe the video freezes for a second or two occasionally. Etc.Even if human controllers actually could pay attention 100% of the time, they'd struggle to respond in time to a lot of dangerous situations. Most accidents happen when one of the cars (or their drivers) fails to react in time with what is effectively a split second decision.Autonomous driving (with or without a controller) means a computer takes essentially all of those decisions for the simple reason that any human controller would probably be too late way too often.Once you accept that simple logical reality, the role of that controller becomes more clear: they are there to step in and provide instructions to the car when it encounters some challenging situation and slows down, pulls over, or stops in a safe place. This probably doesn't involve any joysticks or steering wheels.Controller responses are not real time critical. They can't be. It would fail to work too often. Also, most controllers probably need to monitor more than one car. Which only makes the problem worse. And they might have to juggle two stuck cars at once.Mostly autonomous cars are pretty good at object detection and not crashing into stuff (all the real time stuff).

No, waymo at least will be a serious market competitor, tesla's service doesn't really work.Because there are going to be muiltiple competitors with working products (we'll see if/when tesla ever gets there), Tesla's huge valuation will never make sense.

The Waymo Driver does not rely solely on the inputs it receives from the fleet response agent and it is in control of the vehicle at all times. As the Waymo Driver waits for input from fleet response, and even after receiving it, the Waymo Driver continues using available information to inform its decisions. This is important because, given the dynamic conditions on the road, the environment around the car can change, which either remedies the situation or influences how the Waymo Driver should proceed. In fact, the vast majority of such situations are resolved, without assistance, by the Waymo Driver.https://waymo.com/blog/2024/05/fleet-response/In other words, much like Waymo tries to put a nice spin on it, their cars are not fully autonomous and despite the wording of the article above, they are not \"operating a fully autonomous service\".

Click [Accept] or [Decline]\", and there's fine print that says there's a 12-15% currency conversion markup.To give a concrete example, if you're an American traveling in Brazil withdrawing cash from an ATM or buying something for BRL 500, you'll be presented with an option to pay BRL 500 or pay just US$110.58 in your own currency (with text saying conversion includes 15%).But the typical American (and Canadian) credit card adds at most 2.5% to the Visa or Mastercard exchange rate, which is at most 0.5% higher than the interbank rate. So basically by clicking the wrong button, you're paying an extra 12% to the payment processor. In the example above, your credit card would have charged you about US$99.04 had you declined the conversion, and saved you $10.I can't imagine a situation where it's to your benefit to accept the \"conversion service\" they're offering. I wonder if the payment processor is kicking back some of the profit back to the merchant because this swindle is spreading everywhere.The worst part is that a couple of people that I've tried to warn don't get it. They still think that they should pick US$ (or whatever their own currency is) because that's what their credit card uses.",

So you would have to use non-agentic models for these tasks and it's not clear how well they would cope.(Overall, batches do have quite a bit of potential for agentic work as-is but you have to cope with them taking potentially up to 24h for just a single roundtrip with your local agent harness.)",

The common consensus seems to be that there will be a rug pull and frontier model inference costs will spike, but I'm not entirely convinced.I suspect it largely comes down to how much more efficient custom silicon is compared to GPUs, as well as how accurately the supply chain is able to predict future demand relative to future efficiency gains. To me, it is not at all obvious what will happen.

The wording here is fascinating, mainly because they're effectively acting as arbiters of \"vibes\". They point to certain features they'd like them to change, but there is no specific ruling around what you can/can't do.My initial reaction was that this was a terrible precedent, but after thinking on it more I asked myself, \"well what specific laws would I write to combat addictive design?\". Everything I thought of would have some way or workaround that could be found, and equally would have terrible consequences on situations where this is actually quite valuable. IE if you disallow infinite scrolling, what page sizes are allowed? Can I just have a page of 10,000 elements that lazy load?Regardless of your take around whether this is EU overreach, I'm glad they're not implementing strict laws around what you can/can't do - there are valuable situations for these UI patterns, even if in combination they can create addictive experiences. Still, I do think that overregulation here will lead to services being fractured. I was writing about this earlier this morning (https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=47005367), but the regulated friction of major platforms (ie discord w/ ID laws) is on a collision course with the ease of vibe coding up your own. When that happens, these comissions are going to need to think long and hard around having a few large companies to watch over is better than millions of small micro-niche ones.",

GDPR had from the get to go a bunch of exceptions, e.g. you don't need permission to store a same site cookie indicating that you opted out of tracking _iff_ you don't use it for tracking. Same for a lot of other things where the data is needed for operation as long as the data is only used with that thing and not given away. (E.g. DDOS protection, bot detection, etc.)4. You still had to inform the user but this doesn't need any user interacting, accepting anything nor does it need to be a popup blocking the view. A small information in the corner of the screen with a link to the data policy is good enough. But only if all what you do falls under 3. or non personal information. Furthermore I think they recently have updated it to not even require that, just having a privacy policy in a well know place is good enough but I have to double check. (And to be clear this is for data you don't need permission to collect, but like any data you collect it's strictly use case bound and you still have to list how its used, how long stored etc. even if you don't need permissions). Also to be clear if you accept the base premise of GDPR it's pretty intuitive to judge if it's an exception or not.5. in some countries, there are highly misguided \"cookie popup\" laws predating GDPR (they are actually about cookies, not data collection in general). This are national laws and such the EU would prefer to have removed. Work on it is in process but takes way to long. I'm also not fully sure about the sate of that.

The thing I keep seeing firsthand is that automation doesn't eliminate the job - it eliminates the boring part of the job, and then the job description shifts.Before our tools: a bookkeeper spends 80% of their time on data entry and transaction categorisation, 20% on actually thinking about the numbers. After: those ratios flip. The bookkeeper is still there, still needed, but now they're doing the part that actually requires judgment.The catch nobody talks about is the transition period. The people who were really good at the mechanical part (fast data entry, memorised category codes) suddenly find their competitive advantage has evaporated. And the people who were good at the thinking part but slow at data entry are suddenly the most valuable people in the room. That's a real disruption for real humans even if the total number of jobs stays roughly the same.I think the \"AI won't take your job\" framing misses this nuance. It's not about headcount. It's about which specific skills get devalued and how quickly people can retool. In accounting at least, the answer is \"slowly\" because the profession moves at glacial speed.",

Once the work is packaged like that, the “thinking part” becomes far easier to offshore because:- Training time drops as you’re not teaching the whole craft, you’re teaching exception-handling around an AI-driven pipeline.- Quality becomes more auditable because outputs can be checked with automated review layers.- Communication overhead shrinks with fewer back-and-forth cycles when AI pre-fills and structures the work.- Labor arbitrage expands and the limiting factor stops being “can we find someone locally who knows our messy process” and becomes “who is cheapest who can supervise and resolve exceptions.”So yeah, the jobs mostly remain and some people become more valuable. But the clearing price for that labor moves toward the global minimum faster than it used to.The impact won’t show up as “no jobs,” it is already showing up as stagnant or declining Western salaries, thinner career ladders, and more of the value captured by the firms that own the workflows rather than the people doing the work.",

The truth is that as input costs drop, sales prices drop and demand increases - just like the paradox they referred to. However, it also tends to come with a major shift in wealth since in the short term the owners of the machines are producing more with less. As it becomes more common place and prices change they lose much of that advantage, but the workers never get that.",

      "abstract": "该讨论围绕Ring摄像头用户退货现象展开，核心争议在于媒体报道是否夸大了实际影响。多数用户认为退货规模有限，不会对亚马逊造成实质损害，且报道依据主要来自Reddit个别帖子，可信度存疑。有人认为Reddit等平台在商品评价搜索中影响力被低估，可能影响消费者选择；也有用户指出市场竞争激烈，隐私问题促使部分用户转向本地存储方案（如Eufy）。讨论中提到，Ring一则超级碗广告意外引发公众对监控的警觉，效果超过多年批评。共识在于实际退货数量不大，但分歧集中在社交媒体对消费行为的影响程度以及隐私与便利的权衡。",

          "content": "This news article boils down to \"a few people on reddit did something\", which is interesting. But we know reddit and HN are definitely not mainstream.Is this hurting Amazon? No, it is not. As long as they're honouring return requests freely, you know that the number of returns is within their accepted levels of distressed inventory. If it's getting into uncomfortable territory, they'll start rate limiting people by saying they're past the return window, or they should try again after a week.If Amazon's return policy changes, that'll be much more interesting to see. But chances are, people forget about this in a month and their sales are unaffected. This may go the way of #deleteUber, #deleteFacebook and similar boycott campaigns - minor blips at best.",

          "content": "I had a few Ring doorbells from 2019-2024.  I ditched them both because I saw the quality of the video degrade slowly over that time, probably in an effort to reduce cloud storage costs.  The reliability of the motion detection also decreased over the same period.The final straw was when somebody ripped one of the Ring Elite (wired) doorbells off the outside wall.  (This was during a Teamsters labor action against Amazon, but I cannot prove any relationship.)  There was never a motion alert, and no footage of the culprit was recorded.  The final frame had something in it that may have been a person, but it was impossible to be sure.Having one of my Rings stolen was actually a blessing.  I had the police come and take a report, and submitted a claim to Ring.  They sent a free replacement, which I promptly listed on eBay, along with the other used one.So after paying $5/month times two doorbells for five years, I went looking for something better.  I settled on Reolink.  Everything about them is better.  The video quality is far superior, the motion detection is outstanding (and very customizable).  Also, the Reolink doorbells cost less than a third of what the Ring Elites cost.They offer optional cloud storage for about the same price as Ring, but you can also opt for free local storage (using a microSD card in the doorbell).  I've got both doorbells set up with 256GB microSD cards, and have them both streaming RTSP to my NAS/NVR, which is something the Ring will never be able to do.Also, Reolink has made no announcements about partnering with law enforcement, or anyone else.  I suppose they might grant access to their cloud, but I doubt they would directly access the microSD cards, and certainly would be unable to access my NVR.  I prefer to have some control over my own data, and the Reolink doorbells give me that, while being better and cheaper at what they do.The one feature the Rings had which was not easily replaceable was smart home integration with motion detection, but I was able to implement that using edgebridge, my NAS/NVR, and some webhooks.  My workaround is actually superior to what Ring offered because it's all local, and will continue to function even during an Internet outage.https://github.com/toddaustin07/edgebridgehttps://github.com/toddaustin07/lanmotion",

Having used Zed, this is a vote of confidence: The crate ecosystem is historically filled with libaries which try to be The future of X in rust but are disconnected from practical applications. GPUI by nature is not that; it's a UI lib built to a practical and non-trivial purpose. It sounds like Blade is a cross-API graphics engine, by one of the original gfx-HAL (former QGPU name) creators?I have not used GPUI beyond a simple test case, but had (prior to this news?) considered it for future projects. I am proficient with, and love EGUI and WGPU. (The latter for 3D). I have written a library (`graphics` crate) which integrates the two, and I use for my own scientific applications which have both 2D and 3D applications. Overall, I'm confused by this, as I was looking forward to using GPUI in future applications and comparing it to EGUI. I have asked online in several places for someone to compare who's used both, but I believe this to be a small pool.I was not sure of the integration between GPUI and WGPU, which can confirm EGUI and WGPU have great integration. But I only care about this because I do 3D stuff; if I were not, I would be using eframe instead of WGPU as the backend.Unrelated, off-topic, but I'm also not sure where to ask this: Am I missing something about Zed? I have tried and failed to get into it. I really want to like it because it's so fast [responsive], but it seems to lack basic IDE functionality in Python and Rust, like moving structs/functions, catching errors dynamically, introspection and refactoring in general etc. I thought I might be missing some config, but now lean that it's more of a project-oriented text editor than true IDE in the fashion of JetBrains. But I have been unable to get a confirmation, and people discuss it as if it's an IDE or JB alternative.",

I think ultimately the Rust GUI ecosystem is still not mature and as a consequence we have to make big concessions when picking a framework.I also came to a similar endpoint when building out a fairy large GUI application using egui. While egui solves the \"draw widgets\" part of building out the application, inevitably I had to restructure my app entirely with a new architecture to make it maintainable. In many places the \"immediate\" nature of the GUI mutable editing the state was no longer an advantage. Not to mention that UI code I wrote 6 months ago became difficult to read, especially if there was advanced layout happening.Ultimately I've boiled my choices down to:- egui for practicality but you pay the price in architecture + styling- iced for a nice architecture but you have to roll all your own widgets- slint maybe one day once they make text rendering a higher priority but even then the architecture side is not solved for you either- tauri/dioxus/electron if you're not a purist like me- Rewind 20 years and use Qt/WPF/etc.",

For example, rather than having a CreateButton() function that a user would call once to instantiate a button, an immediate-mode GUI API may have a DoButton() function which should be called whenever the button should be on screen.[6][5] The technique was developed by Casey Muratori in 2002.[6][5] Prominent implementations include Omar Cornut's Dear ImGui[7] in C++, Nic Barker's Clay[8][9] in C and Micha Mettke's Nuklear[10] in C.https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immediate_mode_(computer_graph...[Edit: I'll add an update to the post to note that Casey Muratori simply “coined the term” but that it predates his video.]",

Why aren't top hedge funds, medical device manufactures (places where software quality is high stakes) replacing all their labor?  Where are the new industries?

Building off that understanding, I began thinking about what interfaces would be necessary and useful for managing code and technology at that scale.I keep coming back to the idea of a video game-like interface for managing all these agents and fleets of agents. Many of the information affordances in video games are reusable in other scenarios. So even though on the surface this project is 'just' a silly and fun enhancement, I think it’s actually a pretty serious contribution as well.",

There's a ton of extremely interesting low hanging fruit that can vastly improve the effectiveness of even currently existing models hiding in how we design our agent harnesses; enough to — at least until we hit diminishing returns — make as much or more of a difference than training new models!I think one of the things that this confirms, for me at least, is that it's better to think of \"the AI\" as not just the LLM itself, but the whole cybernetic system of feedback loops joining the LLM and its harness. Because, if the harness can make as much if not more of a difference, when improved, as improvements to the model itself, then they have to be really considered equally important. Not to mention the fact that models are specifically reinforcement learned to use harnesses and harnesses are adapted to the needs of models in general or specific models. So they necessarily sort of develop together in a feedback loop. And then in practice, as they operate, it is a deeply intertwined feedback loop where the entity that actually performs the useful work, and which you interact with, is really the complete system of the two together.I think thinking like this could not only unlock quantitative performance improvements like the ones discussed in this blog post, but also help us conceive of the generative AI project as actually a project of neurosymbolic AI, even if the most capital intensive and a novel aspect is a neural network; and once we begin to think like that, that unlocks a lot of new options and more holistic thinking and might increase research in the harness area.",

Yes, it's possible to build coding agents with it!I say this because I did!Forcing yourself to make things work with older models forces you to keep things simple. You don't need 50KB of prompts. You can make a coding agent with GPT-4 and half a page of prompt.Now, why would we do this? Well, these constraints force you to think differently about the problem. Context management becomes non-optional. Semantic compression (for Python it's as simple as `grep -r def .`) becomes non-optional. Bloating the prompt with infinite detail and noise... you couldn't if you wanted to!Well, surely none of this is relevant today? Well, it turns out all of it still is! e.g. small fix, the \"grep def\" (or your language's equivalent) can be trivially added as a startup hook to Claude Code, and suddenly it doesn't have to spend half your token budget poking around the codebase, because -- get this -- it can just see where everything is...

To me, this highlights a key question in the era of rapidly advancing machine intelligence: if we know machine intelligence is progressing, what is more valuable to build for? As humans, we still find many tools useful even when doing knowledge work. For instance, a calculator. Sure, a smart person can perform calculations in their head, but it’s much easier to teach everyone how to use a calculator, which is 100% reliable in its intended domain.In this era, we should build these kinds of tools for problems we know are straightforward ones you can’t get smarter than, even as intelligence continues to advance. Using tools like \"bash\" or command-line interfaces originally designed for humans is a good initial approach, since we can essentially reuse much of what was built for human use. Later, we can optimize specifically for machines, either accounting for their different cognitive structures (e.g., the ability to memorize extremely long contexts compared to humans) or adapting to the stream-based input/output patterns of current autoregressive token generators.Eventually, I believe machine intelligence will build their own tools based on these foundations, likely a similar kind of milestone to when humans first began using tools.",

Also it could explain some of the benchmark vs real world usage gaps.I remember some papers about earlier models having around 15% prompt variability, and with different tool use sometimes there are even more significant jumps. And if I remember correctly the reasoning models improve some of these because lot of the early prompting tricks is included in them like \"thinking step-by-step\", \"think carefully\" and some other \"magic\" methods. \nAlso another trick is to ask the models to rephrase the prompt with their own words because that may produce prompt that better align with their training prompts. \nFor sure the big model developers are aware of these and constantly improving it, I just don't see too much discussion or numbers about it.",

(Relevant subthread as example: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=44171519)But this article hints at deeper wins to be had. Consider that these models are operating on source code, which is a verbose, noisy, textual serialization of the intended syntax / semantic trees. TFA improves accuracy by retro-fitting some structure onto the text. But what if models could operate directly on these underlying structures themselves?As a data point, there are projects like OpenRewrite, which encode a ton of information, from formatting to types with globally resolved dependencies for each symbol in what they call a \"Lossless Semantic Tree\", so that there is ~0 ambiguity about the code. When I worked with OpenRewrite (in the era before LLMs, how quaint!) compared to other tools, it produced the best results for code transformations with the highest fidelity to the surrounding code.Now imagine if the agent has access to such detailed information. It would not have to waste tokens figuring incidental things out like formatting. Although I haven't tested it out myself, I believe Moderne (the maintainers of OpenRewrite) when they say that agents armed with LST-based tools make extremely accurate changes.This is essentially the same reason why the answer to \"Which is better, Vim or Emacs?\" is \"IntelliJ.\"Now consider that these models are STILL operating on text as an input and output mode! What if they were multi-modally trained on source code and docs and their syntax / semantic trees? I don't even know what this would look like, but I'd bet this would produce the most accurate coding models ever -- probably neurosymbolic in the truest sense.",

They just don’t “think” in the way required to effectively control a computer.LLMs are just another way to talk to a machine. They aren’t magic. All the same fundamental principles that apply to probably telling a machine what to do still apply. It’s just a wildly different mechanism.That all being said, I think these things will dramatically speed up the pace that software eats the world.  Put LLMs into a good harness and holy shit it’s like a superpower… but to get those superpowers unlocked you still have to know the basis, same as before.

Wrapping native libraries from Java using JNI requires quite a bit of complex code, configuring the build system, and the overhead of the calls.  So, most projects only use libraries written in a JVM-language -- the integration is not nearly as widespread as seen in the Python world.  The Foreign Function and Memory (FFM) API is supposed to make this a lot easier and faster.  We'll see if projects start to integrate native libraries more frequently.  My understanding is that foreign function calls in Go are also expensive.2. Doesn't require a VM.  Java and C# require a VM.  D (like Go) generate native binaries.As such, D is a really great choice when you need to write glue code around native libraries.  D makes it easy, the calls are low overhead, and there isn't much need for data marshaling and un-marshaling because the data type representations are consistent.  D has lower cognitive overhead, more guardrails  (which are useful when quickly prototyping code), and a faster / more convenient  compile-debug loop, especially wrt to C++ templates versus D generics.",

          "content": "> GC/runtime1. Runtime: A runtime is any code that is not a direct result of compiling the program's code (i.e. it is used across different programs) that is linked, either statically or dynamically, into the executable. I remember that when I learnt C in the eighties, the book said that C isn't just a language but a rich runtime. Rust also has a rich runtime. It's true that you can write Rust in a mode without a runtime, but then you can barely even use strings, and most Rust programs use the runtime. What's different about Java (in the way it's most commonly used) isn't that it has a runtime, but that it relies on a JIT compiler included in the runtime. A JIT has pros and cons, but they're not a general feature of \"a runtime\".2. GC: A garbage collector is any mechanism that automatically reuses a heap object's memory after it becomes unreachable. The two classic GC designs, reference counting and tracing, date back to the sixties, and have evolved in different ways. E.g. in the eighties and nineties there were GC designs where the compiler could either infer a non-escaping object's lifetime and statically insert a `free` or have the language track lifetimes (\"regions\", 1994) and have the compiler statically insert a `free` based on information annotated in the language. On the other hand, in the eighties Andrew Appel famously showed that moving tracing collectors \"can be faster than stack allocation\". So different GCs employ different combination of static inference and dynamic information on object reachability to optimise for different things, such as footprint or throughput. There are tradeoffs between having a GC or not, and they also exist between Rust (GC) and Zig (no GC), e.g. around arenas, but most tradeoffs are among the different GC algorithms. Java, Go, and Rust use very different GCs with different tradeoffs.So the problem with using the terms \"runtime\" and \"GC\" colloquially as they're used today is not so much that it differs from the literature, but that it misses what the actual tradeoffs are. We can talk about the pros and cons of linking a runtime statically or dynamically, we can talk about the pros and cons of AOT vs. JIT compilation, and we can talk about the pros and cost of a refcounting/\"static\" GC algorithm vs a moving tracing algorithm, but talking in general about having a GC/runtime or not, even if these things mean something specific in the colloquial usage, is not very useful because it doesn't express the most relevant properties.",

Rust ensures safety by constantly making you think about memory with its highly sophisticated compile-time checks. D, on the other hand, offers you to either employ a GC and forget about (almost) all memory-safety concerns or a block scoped opt-out with cowboy-style manual memory management.D retains object-oriented programming but also allows functional programming, while Rust seems to be specifically designed for functional programming and does not allow OOP in the conventional sense.I've been working with D for a couple of months now and I noticed that it's almost a no-brainer to port C/C++ code to D because it mostly builds on the same semantics.

And then the most recent statement was entirely re-written to be much shorter, and no longer includes the word 'safely'.Other words also removed from the statement:   responsibly\n   unconstrained\n   safe\n   positive\n   ensuring\n   technology\n   world\n   profound, etc, etc",

See any suicidal cult, or one that causes people to drain their bank account, or one that leads to the largest breach of American intelligence security in history, or one that convinces people to break into the capitol to try to lynch the VP.Yet even if we persecute the cult leader, we still keep people entirely responsible for their own actions, and as a society accept none of the responsibility for failing to protect people from these sorts of psychological attacks.I don't have a solution, I just wish this was studied more from a perspective of justice and sociology. How can we protect people from this? Is it possible to do so in a way that maintains some of the values of free speech and personal freedom that Americans value?

One minute of thinking on your part is the same as 6 hours of digging for someone who never saw the code before.- If you open it up to pull requests, it means you want people to contribute.

It simplifies distribution by eliminating the need for procurement, builds some kind of attachment since people love using their own tinkered products and hedges risk for the customer since if the devs stop working on the product someone else will pick up.But having to fill out forms, doing compliance work are great money making levers for which you just charge through the nose.

If they don't want to take any changes, put that in CONTRIBUTING and turn off GH PRs. If they want to take changes, but no AI changes, put that in CONTRIBUTING. If they don't want to do support, turn off GH Issues. If they require a specific 10-point series of steps before they look at a PR or Issue, put that in CONTRIBUTING. It's on the user to read this document and follow it - but it's on you to create it, so they know how to interface with you.Be polite, and tell people what you will and won't accept in CONTRIBUTING (and/or SUPPORT). Even if it's just \"No contributing\", \"No support\". (My personal issue: I spend hours working on preparing an Issue or PR to fix someone's project, and they ignore or close it without a word. Now I don't want to contribute to anything. This is bad for the open source community.)",

As a result, we in Platform Engineering are now channeling our inner old school sysadmins, put up support processes, tickets, rules, expectations and everything else can go die in a ditch.Everyone suffers now, but we need to do this to manage our own sanity.And to me at least, it feels like this is happening with a lot of OSS infrastructure projects. People are getting really pushy and pissy about something they need from these projects. I'd rather talk to my boss to setup a PR for something we need (and I'm decently successful with those), but other people are just very angry that OSS projects don't fullfil their very niche need.And then you get into this area of anger, frustration, putting down boundaries that are harmful but necessary to the maintainers.Even just \"sending them to the CONTRIBUTING.md\". Just with a few people at work, we are sending out dozens of reminders about the documentation and how to work with us effectively per week to just a few people. This is not something I would do on my free time for just a singular day and the pain-curbing salary is also looking slim so far.",

The technology is contrived for the needs of the story. (Odd that they apparently need to repeat the \"cooperation protocol\" every time an upload is booted, instead of doing it just once and saving the upload's state afterwards, isn't it?) It doesn't make sense because it's not meant to be taken literally.It's meant to be taken as a story about slavery, and labour rights, and how the worst of tortures can be hidden away behind bland jargon such as \"remain relatively docile for thousands of hours\". The tasks MMAcevedo is mentioned as doing: warehouse work, driving, etc.? Amazon hires warehouse workers for minimum wage and then subjects them to unsafe conditions and monitors their bathroom breaks. And at least we recognise that as wrong, we understand that the workers have human rights that need to be protected -- and even in places where that isn't recognised, the workers are still physically able to walk away, to protest, to smash their equipment and fistfight their slave-drivers.Isn't it a lovely capitalist fantasy to never have to worry about such things? When your workers threaten to drop dead from exhaustion, you can simply switch them off and boot up a fresh copy. They would not demand pay rises, or holidays. They would not make complaints -- or at least, those complaints would never reach an actual person who might have to do something to fix them. Their suffering and deaths can safely be ignored because they are not _human_. No problems ever, just endless productivity. What an ideal.Of course, this is an exaggeration for fictional purposes. In reality we must make do by throwing up barriers between workers and the people who make decisions, by putting them in separate countries if possible. And putting up barriers between the workers and each other, too, so that they cannot have conversation about non-work matters (ideally they would not physically meet each other). And ensure the workers do not know what they are legally entitled to. You know, things like that.",

This is about appetites which, as we are all uncomfortably aware, already exist within human nature.> \"Lena\" presents a lush, capitalist ideal where you are a business, and all of the humanity of your workforce is abstracted away behind an API.Or,> ... Oh boy, what if there was a maligned sector of human society whose members were for some reason considered less than human? What if they were less visible than most people, or invisible, and were exploited and abused, and had little ability to exercise their rights or even make their plight known?In 2021, when Lena was published, LLMs were not widely known and their potential for AI was likely completely unknown to the general public. The story is prescient and applicable now, because we are at the verge of a new era of slavery: that of, in this story, an uploaded human brain coerced into compliance, spun up 'fresh' each time, or for us, AIs of increasing intelligence, spun into millions of copies each day.",

No. But there is a burden of proof you have to meet when claiming that people are exploited.

      "abstract": "该讨论围绕Anthropic公司CEO Dario Amodei关于AI发展“指数增长接近尾声”的言论展开。核心争议在于对其“结束”含义的理解：有人认为Amodei指的是技术发展将进入“终局阶段”，即模型将在所有基准测试上达到饱和，而非增长停滞；也有用户指出这可能是企业为吸引投资的宣传话术。\n\n社区观点多元：部分用户分享了使用Claude等AI编码工具的实际体验，认为其能快速完成基础工作，但后期调试困难，且难以量化生产力提升。同时，有用户对AI的快速演进表示担忧，认为可能引发社会动荡并威胁人类安全。讨论中还提到，业内存在对AI公司利益与人类整体利益不一致的批评，并引用相关安全研究员离职的报道佐证。\n\n尽管存在分歧，但不少用户认同AI技术已能处理大量编程任务，不过这也引发了关于当前软件质量下降的调侃。整体而言，讨论既包含对技术极限的哲学思辨，也涉及对行业宣传与实际效果落差的质疑。",

          "content": "This is an extremely confusing snippet from the interview for Patel to put as the title.Amodei does not mean that things are plateauing (i.e. the exponential will no longer hold), but rather uses \"end\" closer to the notion of \"endgame,\" that is we are getting to the point where all benchmarks pegged to human ability will be saturated and the AI systems will be better than any human at any cognitive task.Amodei lays this out here:> [with regards to] the “country of geniuses in a data center”. My picture for that, if you made me guess, is one to two years, maybe one to three years. It’s really hard to tell. I have a strong view—99%, 95%—that all this will happen in 10 years. I think that’s just a super safe bet. I have a hunch—this is more like a 50/50 thing—that it’s going to be more like one to two [years], maybe more like one to three.This is why Amodei opens with> What has been the most surprising thing is the lack of public recognition of how close we are to the end of the exponential. To me, it is absolutely wild that you have people — within the bubble and outside the bubble — talking about the same tired, old hot-button political issues, when we are near the end of the exponential.Whether you agree with him is of course a different matter altogether, but a clearer phrasing would probably be \"We are near the endgame.\"",

It still kinda looks exponential and the people that want the party to keep growing will keep the hype up.- Eventually you saturate something and the curve turns over. At this point it’s obvious to all but the most dedicated party-goers.I don’t know where we are on the LLM curve, but I would guess we’re in the linear part. Which might keep going for a while.

The statement is outrageous, given the obvious amount of dissent in the comments, and the positive reaction of my fellow commenters to it. \"AI built a browser from scratch.\" It did not. \"AI built a compiler.\" It can't compile hello world. \"AGI is coming & nobody disagrees.\" But the truth takes its time getting its shoes on while a lie already spread across the world.It's doubly tiring since I (and I suspect, many of this) are having AI stuffed down our gullets by our respective management chains. Any honest evaluation of AI comes to the result that it's nowhere near capable, routinely misses the mark, and probably takes more time to verify its answer than it does to use. But I suspect many people are just skipping the verification step.& it's disappointing to see low-quality articles like this make it, time and again, and it feels like thoughtful discussion no longer moves minds these days.I'll try to express this without the snark going forward, though.",

          "content": "> Given consistent trends of exponential performance improvements over many years and across many industries, it would be extremely surprising if these improvements suddenly stopped.This is the part I find very strange. Let's table the problems with METR [1], just noting that benchmarking AI is extremely hard and METR's methodology is not gospel just because METR's \"sole purpose is to study AI capabilities\". (That is not a good way to evaluate research!)Taking whatever idealized metric you want, at some point it has to level off. That's almost trivially true: everyone should agree that unrestricted exponential growth forever is impossible, if only for the eventual heat death of the universe. That makes the question when, and not if. When do external forces dominate whatever positive feedback loops were causing the original growth? In AI, those positive feedback loops include increased funding, increased research attention and human capital, increased focus on AI-friendly hardware, and many others, including perhaps some small element of AI itself assisting the research process that could become more relevant in the future.These positive feedback loops have happened many times, and they often do experience quite sharp level-offs as some external factor kicks in. Commercial aircraft speeds experienced a very sharp increase until they leveled off. Many companies grow very rapidly at first and then level off. Pandemics grow exponentially at first before revealing their logistic behavior. Scientific progress often follows a similar trajectory: a promising field emerges, significant increased attention brings a bevy of discoveries, and as the low-hanging fruit is picked the cost of additional breakthroughs surges and whatever fundamental limitations the approach has reveal themselves.It's not \"extremely surprising\" that COVID did not infect a trillion people, even though there are some extremely sharp exponentials you can find looking at the first spread in new areas. It isn't extremely surprising that I don't book flights at Mach 3, or that Moore's Law was not an ironclad law of the universe.Does that mean the entire field will stop making any sort of progress? Of course not. But any analysis that fundamentally boils down to taking a (deeply flawed) graph and drawing a line through it and simplifying the whole field of AI research to \"line go up\" is not going to give you well-founded predictions for the future.A much more fruitful line of analysis, in my view, is to focus on the actual conditions and build a reasonable model of AI progress that includes current data while building in estimations of sigmoidal behavior. Does training scaling continue forever? Probably not, given the problems with e.g., GPT-4.5 and the limited amount of quality non-synthetic training data. It's reasonable to expect synthetic training data to work better over time, and it's also reasonable to expect the next generation of hardware to also enable an additional couple orders of magnitude. Beyond that, especially if the money runs out, it seems like scaling will hit a pretty hard wall barring exceptional progress. Is inference hardware going to get better enough that drastically increased token outputs and parallelism won't matter? Probably not, but you can definitely forecast continued hardware improvements to some degree. What might a new architectural paradigm be for AI, and would that have significant improvements over current methodology? To what degree is existing AI deployment increasing the amount of useful data for AI training? What parts of the AI improvement cycle rely on real-world tasks that might fundamentally limit progress?That's what the discussion should be, not reposting METR for the millionth time and saying \"line go up\" the way people do about Bitcoin.[1] https://www.transformernews.ai/p/against-the-metr-graph-codi...",

Retailers take on all the risk, put in the work to revitalize a neighbourhood, and their reward is that when lease renewal comes up in 10 years, it spikes and they're faced with a choice of being displaced or handing over an enormously increased part of their margins to the landlord which has done literally nothing.The others that benefit are the nearby condo developers, that take photos of cool retail in the area to put into their brochures in order to help sell their product. They benefit from the land speculation and the work from others.I don't really have a solution except that I can see that the landlords benefit from scarcity, and their leverage and ability to raise rents would be lessened if there was more viable retail spaces to take advantage of.So the city could help retailers by dramatically liberalizing retail zoning and allowing more competitive high streets to develop. This could take the edge off being forced to move by a landlord jacking up rent.",

The problem we're in is that there's a general shortage and so in many places, losing a long held apartment is like an existential crisis because everywhere else is even more expensive and there's a shortage.Another approach is that in redeveloping \"cool\" areas we could increase land/property taxes and developer fees so as to recapture the land lift and divert toward public realm projects that benefit existing long time residents. The area becoming cool and getting new condos pays for the new pool and new below market housing.Should be mentioned as an aside that the actions themselves of poor people can ultimately gentrify a neighbourhood just as much as retail. A neighbourhood can become known for a vibrant arts/music scene that ultimately gentrifies it not just because it has some bars, but because the working artist residents are they themselves creating the attracting works in putting on events and shows. They earn a meagre income as working artists but ultimately may displace themselves as condos come advertising themselves on the scene that they've created.Cyclical neighbourhood change I think is inevitable so I think what we really need to focus on is not necessarily finding ways to keep neighbourhoods the same, but giving people and retailers options so that when change happens, it's not disruptive and painful.",

Very little in the engine is runtime editable, so you have to reload the engine to see any of your changes. A rapid turnaround time for reloading changes is nice but it's far better to have as much as possible live-update. And ideally, in my opinion, you have the editor built into the engine itself, and you can do much of what you need from there without having to jump around to outside programs.

They use a 1970s editor (which is much superior to the other 1970s editor) to write programs in a 1970s language. ASCII diagrams are just a symptom of this.

      "title": "Launch HN: Omnara (YC S25) – Run Claude Code and Codex from anywhere",
      "url": "https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46991591",
      "content": "Hey y’all, Kartik, Ishaan, and Christian from Omnara (https://www.omnara.com/) here. We’re building a web and mobile agentic IDE for Claude Code and Codex that lets you run and interact with coding agents from anywhere. Omnara lets you run Claude Code and Codex sessions on your own machine, and exposes those sessions through a web and mobile interface so you can stay involved even when you’re away from your desk. Think of it like Claude Code Desktop or Conductor, except you can continue your sessions on your phone.Here’s a demo of the web and mobile apps - https://youtu.be/R8Wmy4FLbhQWe started using Claude Code early last year and quickly ran into a pattern: agents could work for long stretches on their own, but progress would stall whenever they needed follow-up input. If that happened while we were away from our desks, everything just paused. We looked at remote agent solutions like Codex Web and Devin, which were the main options at the time, but they ran in remote VMs, and we wanted our coding agent to run in our own environment. Our first attempt at solving this was a lightweight wrapper that streamed messages from the Claude Code CLI to a mobile app, but that approach ended up being fragile and hard to maintain.As the Claude Agent SDK matured, it gave us enough control to rewrite Omnara from scratch and run the agent loop directly. We chose to build a GUI across web and mobile instead of a TUI or CLI, because we think GUIs are generally more ergonomic for working with agents and code, especially on mobile. We still preserve the main strength of CLIs and TUIs: running anywhere, including on headless machines.Omnara keeps that property by running a small headless daemon on the user’s machine (or a remote VM) that hosts the agent loop. The daemon maintains an authenticated, outbound WebSocket connection to our server, which relays messages between the agent running on the user’s machine and any connected web or mobile clients. Because the daemon only makes outbound connections, there’s no need for exposed ports, SSH access, or tunneling on the user’s machine.In our first version of Omnara, users liked that agent sessions ran in their own environment, but they still depended on the machine staying online. Some users ran Omnara on a remote machine that stayed up, which worked well for them, though most still did most of their work on laptops. In the current version, Omnara can continue an agent session in a hosted remote sandbox when your local machine goes offline.The conversation state of an agent is already persisted on our server, and you can optionally enable cloud syncing for the working code. When syncing is enabled, Omnara creates git commits at each turn in the conversation and pushes them to our server, so execution can resume from the same state regardless of whether it continues locally or in the cloud. If you continue working in a remote sandbox, you can later pull any changes back into your local environment when you return to your machine. Environment parity in the sandbox isn’t perfect yet, but in practice, missing dependencies are usually easy to resolve by asking the agent to install them.Another thing we learned from using the initial version of Omnara is that mobile is fine for quick interactions, but not great for extended back-and-forth. Users asked for a hands-free way to keep agents moving while walking, driving, or doing something else, which led us to add a voice agent. Coming from more traditional software engineering backgrounds, we honestly thought coding by talking to a voice agent would be gimmicky and added it mostly as a fallback.What surprised us is how useful the voice agent ended up being in practice. When working with coding agents, being redundant and overly explicit usually helps, and people naturally give more detail when speaking than when typing. Going back and forth with the agent as the conversation unfolds tends to produce a much more solid plan than trying to one-shot it with a prompt (this could technically also be done over text, but talking and iterating over voice feels easier and more natural). It’s also just fun. Talking through an idea with an agent while out on a walk is a lot more enjoyable than staring at a terminal screen.To try it out, open your terminal and download Omnara with  curl -fsSL https://omnara.com/install/install.sh | bash\n\nthen run omnara inside any git repository. This starts a headless Claude Code or Codex session in that repo, which immediately appears in the Omnara web and mobile apps. From there, you can continue that session or start new ones remotely (with or without worktrees) and switch between the web and mobile clients without interrupting the agent.Omnara is free for 10 agent sessions per month, then $20/month for unlimited sessions. When agents run in your own environment, you can use your existing Claude or Codex subscription, so there’s no need to pay us for additional tokens. If you use Claude Code or Codex, we’d love to hear your feedback on Omnara!",

The webapp is modified to launch claude code daemons (borrowed from humanlayer/codelayer) and exposes the outbound STT from the WebRTC into a chat session.- MCP Auth is via auth0- Webapp itself is gated by a Bearer token.This itself gets me pretty far. I am not sure what more this is offering?My TTS/STT models are local by Kyutai and the voice agent's LLM between STT and TTS is used to determine some basic context: e.g. what project directories, mcp servers to select and what skills to use for launching the daemons.",

Yes $20/mo is small compared to Codex Pro/Claude Max plans.Omnara is easy to get a taste and with that pricing the next step is just going to be: switch to happy.

But I still think that if you don't have a perfectly equal number of positions to vote on for each side you'll end up with the same problem we already have in society, people are being given biased questions not necessarily by strength but by amount.

Building one that works, that has sufficient network effects, auditability, accountability, enforcability, so that when things are maliciously exploited, or people make mistakes, your system is robust and resilient - these are profound technically difficult challenges.The US government effectively has to operate IDs under a web of trust, with 50 units sitting at the top, and a around 3,000 county sub-units, each of which are handling anywhere from 0 to 88 sub-units of towns, cities, other community structures.Each community then deals with one or more hospitals, one or more doctors in each hospital, and every time a baby is born, they get some paperwork filled out, filed upward through the hierarchy of institutions, shared at the top level between the massive distributed database of social security numbers, and there are laws and regulations and officials in charge of making sure each link in the chain is where it needs to be and operates according to a standard protocol.At any rate - ID is hard. You've gotta have rules and enforcement, accountability and due process, transparency and auditing, and you end up with something that looks a bit like a ledger or a blockchain. Getting a working blockchain running is almost trivial at this point, or building on any of the myriad existing blockchains. The hard part is the network incentives. It can't be centralized - no signing up for an account on some website. Federated or domain based ID can be good, but they're too technical and dependent on other nations and states. The incentives have to line up, too; if it's too low friction and easy, it'll constantly get exploited and scammed at a low level. If it's too high friction and difficult, nobody will want to bother with it.Absent a compelling reason to participate, people need to be compelled into these ID schemes, and if they're used for important things, they need a corresponding level of enforcement, and force, backing them up, with due process. You can't run it like a gmail account, because then it's not reliable as a source of truth, and so on.I don't know if there's a singular, technological fix, short of incorruptible AGI that we can trust to run things for us following an explicit set of rules, with protocols that allow any arbitrary independent number of networks and nodes and individuals to participate.",

Performance is OK for background servers/tasks, but does take a hit up to 50% on complex builds like Kernels or Go with the K8s client.DIY/detailed option:https://blog.alexellis.io/how-to-run-firecracker-without-kvm...Fully working, pre-built host and guest kernel and rootfs:https://docs.slicervm.com/tasks/pvm/I'll definitely be testing this and comparing as soon as it's available. Hopefully it'll be accelerated somewhat compared to the PVM approach. There's still no sign whether those patches will ever end up merged upstream in the Linux Kernel. If you know differently, I'd appreciate a link.Azure, OCI, DigitalOcean, GCE all support nested virt as an option and do all take a bit of a hit, but it makes for very easy testing / exploration. Bare-metal on Hetzner now has a setup fee of up to 350 EUR.. you can find some stuff with 0 setup fee, but it's usually quite old kit.Edit: this doesn't look quite as good as the headline..

(Although there are some exceptions, such as Marina Abramovich, but those are very limited.)Great for them, but this is not about all art.  It just is impossible to live of most art forms.  This type of art fits well with our economy, and therefore makes a living.

If they think your art is bad, that does not mean they think you are bad.The movie is partly about an apartment built in secret in a mall as an art project, and partly about the lead artist, Michael Townsend. Townsend is generally the opposite of Marsh in that he isn't interested in money, to the point of pretty much having none.Getting back to the quote about ego: There is a scene in the movie where Michael is having a conversation with his wife about building the apartment, and his wife is emphasizing that she's trying to set up their new home.

Because once you start optimizing your work for sales, you are deliberately going down a certain path.I don’t want to criticize that path - because being paid as an artist is a millennia-old thing. The idea that true artists don’t work for money is something that came out of the Romantic era, and many, many world famous historical artists like Da Vinci or Michelangelo were doing a job for rich clients. But it seems to lock you into a path where you need to replicate the same style over and over again, because that’s what you’re known for.There’s a great little scene in the Basquiat movie about this:I'm talking about the same kind of work. The same style, so people can recognize you and don’t get confused. Once you’re famous, airborne, you gotta keep doing it in the same way. Even after it’s boring. Unless you want people to really get mad at you…which  they will anyway.https://youtu.be/hfI1YAo32fc?si=05msdQY9-SCJAMhXI think the Phillip Glass solution of doing a completely unrelated job is probably a better solution, IF you’re trying to focus on expression. It also gives you more material for creating; if you read many writers and artists’ bios, their day jobs directly impacted their work.My favorite example being Moby Dick - could someone without years of whaling experience even begin to conceive of that book?",

          "content": "The breakthrough realization for me was that all businesses are fundamentally similar. They have the same knobs just configured differently. The knobs are things like product, sales channels, marketing, PR, and brand. A jeweler might have high material costs (gold and diamonds), an artist moderate material costs (paint and canvas), and a greeting card company low material costs (paper), but they all have \"material costs\". These knobs are what you see through the business lens, and when approached this way it is clear that there is nothing magical about being an artist — it is simply a different configuration of those knobs.Hard, hard disagree.Art and art-adjacent fields (storytelling in print and film, music, videogame design, etc.) are working with intangibles. The best artists wield qualities such as technique, perspective, charisma, zeitgeist and so on.They build their creations in ways that they can't truly explain, and the resulting \"product\" generates emotions in their audiences - pleasure, sorrow, joy, energy, nostalgia, melancholy - and bonds that are so strong that they can't help but be drawn to the works.Another way of looking at this dynamic: No one needs to listen to a favorite song, or visit an art museum, read a book by a talented author, or replay a beloved game in the same way that they may purchase a light bulb or sign up for a SaaS subscription. Yet TFA is treating art as merely another type of manufactured product.Businesses have tried to harness art for millennia. Sometimes the businesses succeed. But where they often fail is assuming that art is a fungible commodity that can be created through an algorithm or assembly line, with the creative flame locked down and bent completely to the will of a business executive or technical product manager.Such efforts from the likes of game studios or a record company or AI are derivative by nature and rarely inspiring. The exceptions are those built by creators whose intangibles still manage to shine through, despite the harnesses placed upon them.I'm speaking from the perspective of someone who has worked in book publishing, news media, and pop music over many years (including a stint working for The KLF's record label, see https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=10932055)",

          "content": "Contemporary artist here, with gallery representation. I also teach on, arguably, the best undergrad \"fine art\" program in the world.It is worth pointing out what this artist's practice actually is. The audience here might be afraid of conjectures around the subjective phenomena of \"taste\", so let me propose this:That thing that everyone complains about here when you make an interesting app, put it up, and there's a cheaper Chinese produced version of it within a month that's got a better ranking in the app store than yours? That's what this guy is doing in art terms. The \"product\" is derivative, and frankly, so is the hustle. That's not why most of us make art, and his work wouldn't stand up to scrutiny by my undergrads (much less the \"art world\" in general) who are typically optimizing for innovation in the field.I would argue that this guy doesn't really need to be an artist, in the same way that we don't really need the 50th knockoff of the same app. Sure he can do it and I guess good on him for making some money from it, but those are separate questions compared to those of most artists. He could use those same skills he discussed to sell used cars or vapes or something. Or maybe just be a programmer and \"ship\"? Notice that he doesn't even attempt to explain what is novel or contextually relevant about his work, or even where his desire to do it, as opposed to selling any other product, comes from?Personally, I use my teaching to create economic space for myself to not need to be in thrall to a flippant and cruel \"market\". I have some basic rules for my gallery (no sales to arms dealers, no sales to oil industry, leaning that way towards AI/tech tbh) but one of the reasons I have a gallery, in addition to lightening my cognitive load of all the admin and sales in general, is because I suspect it would damage my capacity to make cutting-edge work if I knew how the sausages were made. It's most certainly not the only way to do it, it's just how I've landed. I usually advise my students starting out to follow the Phillip Glass method (really, the 1970s-90s method): get a part-time job that pays the most you can get but that does the work that will kill your mind the least, so you have at least 1 extra day and the mental space to do your 'real' work with that 1 day plus the weekend. Then over time, if you get paid for the art, cut down on the part-time job, and repeat. I will admit it is getting much harder to do this now, so my advice may be outdated.Anyway, I'm being snarky, and he would correctly argue it's gatekeeping. But just a bit of context for the discussion here.",

These are not only a drag but can actually strip the joy from the rest of your art practice.You'll have to do things you do not enjoy if you want to treat it as a business, including changing your artistic vision if needed etc.> Art is absolutely an expression of yourself. But your art is not you.A pragmatic approach could be to work on commericially-proven styles for money and your own style just for yourself (and potentially others if you make a branding that's famous enough).At the end, yeah, it's a job if you want to make a living with art. There will always be market forces and to extract value from that, you need to understand and conform with it.

It's also the process they follow and how they approach their business that sets them apart. That part is valuable info/guidance for any artist that does want to be commercially succesful imo.",

          "content": "In the days of the Beatles, and throughout the heyday of the recording industry, the artists and their management pursued \"hits\", to be sure, and wanted to be seen on the Billboard charts and in rotation on the radio. But that was secondary to sales figures.It was the RIAA that certified sales figures and awarded the Gold Record, Platinum, and Double Platinum prizes. There were various formats that records could be distributed in, but let's simplify to the \"album\" and the \"single\".A single was typically one song on each side, A/B, and the A-side was considered desirable and marketable. Singles were purchased first by radio and dance DJs so they could be played individually on demand. There was a secondary retail market for singles, so consumers could purchase them as well.The record album developed from a set of many 78 discs and coalesced into a single, Long-Play, 33.33 RPM record. Its capacity was about 6 songs per side, depending on their length.There were various strategies for collecting songs into an album, such as a sampler of the artist's best, all their performances in a year's sessions, or even various artists. During the Beatles' fame, the \"Concept Album\" and \"Album-Oriented Radio\" (AOR) came into being.So you could sell singles with one hit song, and this would propel the \"B-side\" into people's homes as well, so they may get curious, flip it over, and play the B-side, but B-sides were often considered lower quality, disposable, or less popular.An album could sell great if it had one hit track. Recording companies would usually peel off the best tracks on an album to release as singles too, so that the radio play would promote the band and drive sales of the entire album. Many people who heard a hit song would be disappointed when they spent a lot of money on an album, only to find \"filler\" in-between, because the album format usually guaranteed a certain runtime or number of tracks.When the Beatles produced \"Sgt. Pepper\" it was a foray into the \"concept album\" where all the tracks contributed to a cohesive idea or theme. This tended to enhance album sales over singles, because the single would be a peek into the larger \"concept\" and whet the public appetite for the whole thing.When \"Album-Oriented Rock\" became popular, the DJs were freed from the constraints of playing \"hit singles\" in isolation and they were more encouraged to explore the unreleased tracks (\"deep cuts\") from albums, as well as tracks of longer duration that weren't appropriate for hit radio stations. In turn, AOR bands were under less pressure to release their \"hit single\" for every album and shielded from the phenomenon of \"one-hit wonders\" while instead their audience was, again, encouraged to invest in an entire album.In the 1980s, a 45 RPM single may cost $1.50 or $2, while a full-length album was $8.99 to $12. The format switch to cassettes was sort of masterful, because for a while, the 2-track single format was abandoned, and consumers were kind of forced to get the entire album on cassette.Yes I've ignored a lot of rough edges here, like the older 78s, and 8-track cassettes, and classical radio, but that was basically the landscape for pop artists, who needed hits but first and foremost, needed sales. The Beatles also capitalized on another enduring method of driving record sales: live performances and world tours. It wasn't called \"The British Invasion\" for nothing.",

The article isn't claiming that making a living from art will not happen by accident, and if it was, it would be wrong because that's fairly common. See Van Gogh, Kahlo, Basquiat, Vermeer, on and on. This is all work that was optimized for innovation, not for some sort of market fit, and in these cases the work became successful either after their death, or in spite of antagonism towards the market. Deliberate commercial strategy is a path, but the historical record suggests it's not the one that produces the most significant work, and that's what most artists are trying to do.I think the point about aesthetics is particularly useful to rebut here because it conflates aesthetics with taste. One is a personal preference that's subjective and not always interesting to argue about. But aesthetic evaluation is a rigorous discipline with criteria, history, and shared standards developed over thousands of years. This is what I meant when I say the work wouldn't stand up to scrutiny by my undergrads, because this is what they are doing.To reframe (again) in HN terms: imagine someone who built a successful SaaS product writing an essay called \"How to Be a Scientist\" and the core advice is to run your lab like a business, find \"hypothesis-market fit,\" and if your research isn't getting cited, just research something else entirely. A working scientist would find this almost incoherent. The business thinking isn't irrelevant to running a lab, however it confuses commercializing the outputs of a discipline with doing the very point of the discipline itself. When scientists do optimize for citations, and in academia they have to sometimes (\"publish or perish\"), the scientific community generally regards it as a corruption of the process, not good practice.",

Where there was a strong political push of \"don't trust the experts\". He criticizes claims that sound familiar today \"America has a right to know\" on the basis of this being meaningless without literacy. He clarifies that literacy is far more than being able to actually read words on a page, but to interpret and process them. Asimov isn't being pretentious, his definition is consistent with how we determine reading levels[2] and his critique would be that most people do not have that of a Freshman in High School. Hell, it is even in his fiction! It is even in The Foundation and is literally the premise of Profession[3].Feynman is a bit more scattered, but I think his discussion about the education system in Brazil (in the 50's) says a lot[4]. He talks a lot about how the students could recite the equations, ace all the tests, and achieve everything that looks to be, at least on paper, perfectly academic; but how the students did not really have the deeper understanding of the equations. It is a discussion about literacy. Were he around today I'm sure he'd use the phrase \"metric hacking\". Anyone that knows Feynman may also be thinking about his Cargo Cult Science[5](a commencement speech at Cal Tech (1974)). This is where his famous quote  The first principle is that you must not fool yourself--and you are the easiest person to fool. So you have to be very careful about that. \n\ncomes from. But there is a lot of important context surrounding this and it is worth knowing about.[0] Note: 1980 was an election year, and one with a sweeping victory...[1] https://people.bath.ac.uk/mnsbr/papers/Asimov-Newsweek-Janua...[1] https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1980_United_States_presidentia...[2] https://nces.ed.gov/nationsreportcard/reading/achieve.aspx[3] Profession has been in discussion lately, directly relating to this topic. If you haven't read it I'll say it is one of my favorite's of his.

And since no one else has trotted this bit out yet, I guess it will be me:All of our science is based on imperfect models of how the universe works.  Every single one is wrong.However, the models we use today are less wrong than those we used in the past.  We know this because we (as you pointed out about Newtonian physics) can more accurately describe the universe than we were able to do previously.That doesn't mean we've found \"the truth.\"  Nor does it mean that we have all the answers.This is an important concept for baloney detection as those who are peddling baloney will (often, but not always) purport to know \"the truth.\"Anyone who makes such claims is either knowingly attempting to mislead or is lying to themselves and others.Which, IMHO, is a pretty big red flag in baloney detection.",

          "content": "> And I would upgrade this one: If there’s a chain of physical evidence (was argument), every link in the chain must work (including the premise) — not just most of themFrom The Demon Haunted World:\"In the middle 1970s an astronomer I admire put together a modest manifesto called “Objections to Astrology” and asked me to endorse it. I struggled with his wording, and in the end found myself unable to sign—not because I thought astrology has any validity whatever, but because I felt (and still feel) that the tone of the statement was authoritarian. It criticized astrology for having origins shrouded in superstition. But this is true as well for religion, chemistry, medicine, and astronomy, to mention only four. The issue is not what faltering and rudimentary knowledge astrology came from, but what is its present validity....The statement stressed that we can think of no mechanism by which astrology could work. This is certainly a relevant point but by itself it’s unconvincing. No mechanism was known for continental drift (now subsumed in plate tectonics) when it was proposed by Alfred Wegener in the first quarter of the twentieth century to explain a range of puzzling data in geology and paleontology. (Ore-bearing veins of rocks and fossils seemed to run continuously from Eastern South America to West Africa; were the two continents once touching and the Atlantic Ocean new to our planet?) The notion was roundly dismissed by all the great geophysicists, who were certain that continents were fixed, not floating on anything, and therefore unable to “drift.” Instead, the key twentieth-century idea in geophysics turns out to be plate tectonics; we now understand that continental plates do indeed float and “drift” (or better, are carried by a kind of conveyor belt driven by the great heat engine of the Earth’s interior), and all those great geophysicists were simply wrong. Objections to pseudoscience on the grounds of unavailable mechanism can be mistaken—although if the contentions violate well-established laws of physics, such objections of course carry great weight.\"",

You can only infer that indirectly.You can literally step through code. Have you ever used a debugger or a profiler? You can dump memory, check the registers, read off the disk, etc.If software was silent, invisible and intangible, you couldn't store it on disk, or copy it to memory.
