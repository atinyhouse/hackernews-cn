But I think this is a reasonable place for me to post some thoughts.Given current events in the USA, I can't emphasize enough how worried one should be about the fact that a few companies like Discord, Google (Gmail), and Meta have databases with access to the private conversations of hundreds of millions of people with their closest friends and family members, linked up with their identity.Some of the big strengths of running a self-hosted Zulip server for your community are:- Zulip servers are operationally simple, highly stable and easy to upgrade.- Zulip is much better than Discord or Slack for managing the firehose of busy communities. Or at least, a lot of people tell us that they prefer the user experience to everything else they've tried, after a few weeks of getting used to it. :)- Your community leaders get to make the policy decisions about data protection, identity, etc.- It's 100% FOSS software, with an extremely readable and maintainable codebase that ~1500 people have successfully contributed code to. I don't think you'll find modern alternatives with a comparable featureset to Discord that are more resilient to the sponsoring company being acquired or going out of business.- We are a values-focused organization (https://zulip.com/values/) where providing a public service is important to us all.- Each server is completely self-contained and independent, with the only centralized services needed from us being desktop/mobile app publication and mobile push notifications delivery (which is free for community use and soon to be E2EE).I'm happy to answer any questions.",

This article title is very misleaing and wrong. ))Tl;dr: The vast majority of adults will never have to interact with our age assurance systems and their experience won't change, because we know Discord and how people use it, so we're designing to respect privacy and deliver a safer experience while minimizing friction for adults.Hey folks –I’ve been on Discord since very early 2016 and actually joined the company in 2017. Safety is one of my areas, so today’s announcement on our blog is something I’ve been pretty involved with. I’ve always cared about Discord's approach to privacy (E2EE for A/V was another of my projects here), so I figured I’d add some more context to today's news.I can say confidently that the vast majority of people will never see age verification. I say this because we launched age assurance in the UK and Australia in 2025, and we have some pretty good data on this now. The idea here is that we can pre-identify most adults based on what we already know (not including your messages!), and that looks to get us pretty far here. No face scans, no IDs, for the vast majority of adults.And if you are one of the smaller subset of folks that we can't definitively pre-identify, then still, you only have to do it if you're accessing age-restricted servers or channels, or changing certain settings. That's really not most users. (Altho... might be more Redditors, tbh.)Last, I know that there is concern about privacy and data leaks. That's a real concern. The selfie system is built purely client-side, it never leaves your device, and we did that intentionally. That'll work for a bunch of users who aren't pre-identified as adults. But if you do end up in the ID bucket, then yeah, you're right that has some risk. We're doing what we can to minimize this by working with our range of partners (who are different partners than the data leak you read about), and if it's any help, we learned a lot internally from the last issue. But I get if that doesn't necessarily inspire more confidence.Anyway, we’ll be sharing more next month as we get closer to the global roll out about the system, including the technology behind it in March. I honestly wouldn't be happy if we didn't build something good and I am excited about what we’re launching, but please let us know what you think when we share more details.And I really appreciate everybody's feedback here today. We’re definitely reading it!",

She gave them everything they asked for, but when Facebook reviewed the appeal, they closed her account permanently.I can't speak for every company, but I know with Facebook and Paypal, these requests generally are from automated systems and the chances of successfully reopening the account is well under 1%. The info you submit is not viewed by a human and the systems are mostly treated as a way to lighten the load on human support staff. They don't care if your account is reopened, they just want you to feel like you had a chance, did all you could, and then just give up.I discovered this about 20 years ago dealing with Paypal. I happened to know someone who worked in Paypal engineering at the time. I had a well established account, a Paypal debit card, linked accounts, etc., everything you could need to feel good about an account.Out of the blue it was suspended and I was sent into this system to send in verification documents. I gave everything it wanted. First it was ID, then a \"utility bill\" so I sent over my phone bill. That wasn't acceptable because it didn't prove I lived at my address for some reason, so I sent a natural gas bill. Even though that did have to be tied to a physical address (you can't deliver gas wirelessly!) I was asked for an electric bill. Then the lease. Then a bank statement. Every time I gave it pretty quickly. Then I was asked for a passport. I didn't have one. Suddenly that was the only thing that could unlock my account and as soon as they had the passport my account would be reopened. Nothing further would be done without a passport, not even communication.I asked my friend to look into it. She said, \"that's on purpose, that's the NoBot. It gets people out of support's hair.\" Turns out if you let unhappy customers complain to humans on the phone they will, so some exec decided to improve call center metrics by forcing customers into a system designed to keep them occupied until they gave up. You funneled people into it, and it would continue to reject their submissions with new reasons infinitely. It just went through a list of things to ask for, and when it found one you couldn't provide, suddenly that was the key and without it you were screwed.Companies still do this today.",

Even though that did have to be tied to a physical address (you can't deliver gas wirelessly!) I was asked for an electric bill. Then the lease. Then a bank statement. Every time I gave it pretty quickly. Then I was asked for a passport. I didn't have one. Suddenly that was the only thing that could unlock my account and as soon as they had the passport my account would be reopened. Nothing further would be done without a passport, not even communication.I asked my friend to look into it. She said, \"that's on purpose, that's the NoBot. It gets people out of support's hair.\" Turns out if you let unhappy customers complain to humans on the phone they will, so some exec decided to improve call center metrics by forcing customers into a system designed to keep them occupied until they gave up. You funneled people into it, and it would continue to reject their submissions with new reasons infinitely. It just went through a list of things to ask for, and when it found one you couldn't provide, suddenly that was the key and without it you were screwed.Companies still do this today."

So if you want your self-hosted Zulip server to work with the Zulip client apps in the App Store and Play Store, you have to use Zulip's push server, and there's nothing Zulip can do to fix that.Matrix works analogously; if you use the Element app from the App Store or Play Store, then you're using Element's push notification server, even if your Matrix homeserver is self-hosted. It's possible that Element allows their server to be used gratis in situations where Zulip charges a fee, I don't know their policies or anything, but in principle Matrix still leaves you exactly as dependent on a third party's goodwill unless you make your friends install a privately distributed mobile app.Zulip IIUC does not restrict self-hosting of any feature that's technically possible to self-host.",

I learn much better working with real code and this was a great experience. It was certainly a different experience than it would have been without an LLM teacher, reviewer, helper, assistant. The app was beautifully designed and very cleanly implemented back in Java 1.4 days of 2004 so it has been a joy to modernize it while attempting to preserve the clean design.  The OpenGL work and the necessary math was a lot different than what I have been doing for most of my career so it was a lot of fun. I will probably continue tinkering with Tribal Trouble occasionally as I still enjoy playing the game. I want to learn Blender to edit/improve the 3D models.

There are a lot of blind and low vision IT folks for whom this tool is a job requirement. The current accessibility is unfortunately poor. I've submitted my first PR and am relearning the Wireshark source after last contributing 20 years ago. It's also been 15 years since the last time I did anything with Qt so that has been a refresher as well. I don't enjoy working in C++ but the goal matters so I will suffer through. (https://wireshark.org)I plan to work on Wireshark for a couple of months at least and then look for something else to contribute to, probably also accessibility related. I have some ideas already about next apps. I'm currently tempted to build an NFC app for iOS in Swift but haven't decided yet.

Hopefully this might help others the way it did for our family. The app is built using flutter because im going to release it on Android too very soon, and I couldnt be bothered creating it twice. Initially the idea was more of a game-like-app, and then it made sense to use flutter. Now though, its not really game-like and couldve just as well been native (apart for me not bothering doing it twice). If i wouldve done it again from scratch, for this app, i would still have chosen flutter."

This can still be useful, but is a far cry from what seems to be the online discourse right now.As a real world example, I was told to evaluate Claude Code and ChatGPT codex at my current job since my boss had heard about them and wanted to know what it would mean for our operations. Our main environment is a C# and Typescript monorepo with 2 products being developed, and even with a pretty extensive test suite and a nearly 100 line \"AGENTS.md\" file, all models I tried basically fail or try to shortcut nearly every task I give it, even when using \"plan mode\" to give it time to come up with a plan before starting. To be fair, I was able to get it to work pretty well after giving it extremely detailed instructions and monitoring the \"thinking\" output and stopping it when I see something wrong there to correct it, but at that point I felt silly for spending all that effort just driving the bot instead of doing it myself.It almost feels like this is some \"open secret\" which we're all pretending isn't the case too, since if it were really as good as a lot of people are saying there should be a massive increase in the number of high quality projects/products being developed.

GPT-5.2 xhigh is a marvel at this stuff.My codebases are scala, pekko, typescript/react, and lilypond - yeah, the best models even understand lilypond now so I can give it a leadsheet and have it arrange for me two-hand jazz piano exercises.I generally think that if people can't reach the above level of success at this point in time, they need to think more about how to communicate better with the models. There's a real \"you get out of it what you put into it\" aspect to using these tools."

Sometimes when I go to test it I need to correct it and point out it missed something or I notice when in the planning phase that it is missing something.However I do find if you use a more powerful opus model when planning, it does consider things fully a lot better than it used to. This is actually one area I have been seeing some very good improvements as the models and tooling improves.In fact, I actually hope that these AI tools keep getting better at the point you mention, as humans also have a \"context limit\". There are only so many small details I can remember about the codebase so it is good if AI can \"remember\" or check these things.I guess a lot of the AI can also depend on your codebase itself, how you prompt it, and what kind of agents file you have. If you have a robust set of tests for your application you can very easily have AI tools check their work to ensure things aren't being broken and quickly fix it before even completing the task. If you don't have any testing more could be missed. So I guess it's just like a human in some sense.

Sometimes when I go to test it I need to correct it and point out it missed something or I notice when in the planning phase that it is missing something.However I do find if you use a more powerful opus model when planning, it does consider things fully a lot better than it used to. This is actually one area I have been seeing some very good improvements as the models and tooling improves.In fact, I actually hope that these 人工智能 tools keep getting better at the point you mention, as humans also have a \"context limit\". There are only so many small details I can remember about the codebase so it is good if 人工智能 can \"remember\" or check these things.I guess a lot of the 人工智能 can also depend on your codebase itself, how you prompt it, and what kind of agents file you have. If you have a robust set of tests for your application you can very easily have 人工智能 tools check their work to ensure things aren't being broken and quickly fix it before even completing the task. If you don't have any testing more could be missed. So I guess it's just like a human in some sense. If you have a crappy codebase for the 人工智能 to work with, the 人工智能 may also sometimes create sloppy work."

If your codebase has bad foundation and going in the wrong direction with lots of hacks, it will just write code which mirrors the existing style... And you get exactly was OP is suggesting.If however, your code foundations are good and highly consistent and never allow hacks, then the AI will maintain that clean style and it becomes shockingly good; in this case, the prompting barely even matters. The code foundation is everything.But I understand why a lot of people are still having a poor experience. Most codebases are bad. They work (within very rigid constraints, in very specific environments) but they're unmaintainable and very difficult to extend; require hacks on top of hacks. Each new feature essentially requires a minor or major refactoring; requiring more and more scattered code changes as everything is interdependent (tight coupling, low cohesion). Productivity just grinds to a slow crawl and you need 100 engineers to do what previously could have been done with just 1. This is not a new effect. It's just much more obvious now with AI.I've been saying this for years but I think too few engineers had actually built complex projects on their own to understand this effect. There's a parallel with building architecture; you are constrained by the foundation of the building. If you designed the foundation for a regular single storey house, you can't change your mind half-way through the construction process to build a 20-storey skyscraper.

So if you have a high-priority (UserInitiated) process, and it makes an IPC call out to a daemon that is usually a low-priority background daemon, the high-priority process passes a voucher to the low-priority one, which allows the daemon’s ipc handling thread to run high-priority (and thus access P-cores) so long as it’s holding the voucher.This lets Apple architect things as small, single-responsibility processes, but make their priority dynamic, such that they’re usually low-priority unless a foreground user process is blocked on their work. I’m not sure the Linux kernel has this.",

It's not exactly conclusive, and if I was doing this properly properly then I'd try a bit harder to make everything match up, but it does indeed look like using clang to build x64 code is more expensive - for whatever reason - than using it to build ARM code.Systems, including clang version and single-core PassMark:    M4 Max Mac Studio, clang-1700.6.3.2 (PassMark: 5000)\n    x64 i7-5557U Macbook Pro, clang-1500.1.0.2.5 (PassMark: 2290)\n    x64 AMD 2990WX Linux desktop, clang-20 (PassMark: 2431)\n\nSingle thread build times (in seconds). Code is a bunch of C++, plus some FOSS dependencies that are C, everything built with optimisation enabled:    Mac Studio: 365\n    x64 Macbook Pro: 1705\n    x64 Linux: 1422\n\n(Linux time excludes build times for some of the FOSS dependencies, which on Linux come prebuilt via the package manager.)Single thread test suite times (in seconds), an approximate indication of relative single thread performance:    Mac Studio: 120\n    x64 Macbook Pro: 350\n    x64 Linux: 309\n\nBuild time/test time makes it look like ARM clang is an outlier:    Mac Studio: 3.04\n    x64 Macbook Pro: 4.87\n    x64 Linux: 4.60\n\n(The Linux value is flattered here, as it excludes dependency build times, as above.

It's not exactly conclusive, and if I was doing this properly properly then I'd try a bit harder to make everything match up, but it does indeed look like using clang to build x64 code is more expensive - for whatever reason - than using it to build ARM code.Systems, including clang version and single-core PassMark:    M4 Max Mac Studio, clang-1700.6.3.2 (PassMark: 5000)\n    x64 i7-5557U Macbook Pro, clang-1500.1.0.2.5 (PassMark: 2290)\n    x64 AMD 2990WX Linux desktop, clang-20 (PassMark: 2431)\n\nSingle thread build times (in seconds). Code is a bunch of C++, plus some FOSS dependencies that are C, everything built with optimisation enabled:    Mac Studio: 365\n    x64 Macbook Pro: 1705\n    x64 Linux: 1422\n\n(Linux time excludes build times for some of the FOSS dependencies, which on Linux come prebuilt via the package manager.)Single thread test suite times (in seconds), an approximate indication of relative single thread performance:    Mac Studio: 120\n    x64 Macbook Pro: 350\n    x64 Linux: 309\n\nBuild time/test time makes it look like ARM clang is an outlier:    Mac Studio: 3.04\n    x64 Macbook Pro: 4.87\n    x64 Linux: 4.60\n\n(The Linux value is flattered here, as it excludes dependency build times, as above.

This is beneficial on all sorts of systems, but particularly shines on those heterogenous ones, allowing unimportant workloads to always occupy E cores, and freeing P cores for loads that would benefit from them, or simply letting them sleep for longer.

It is literally a one-way algorithm that outputs a single word. It has no knowledge, memory, and it’s doesn’t know what’s next. As far as the algorithm is concerned it’s done! It outputs ONE token for any given input.Now, if you start over and put in “What is the capital of France? The” it’ll output “ “. That’s it. Between your two inputs were a million others, none of them have a plan for the conversation, it’s just one token out for whatever input.But if you start over yet again and put in “What is the capital of France? The “ it’ll output “capital”. That’s it. You see where this is going?Then someone uttered the words that have built and destroyed empires: “what if I automate this?” And so it was that the output was piped directly back into the input, probably using AutoHotKey. But oh no, it just kept adding one word at a time until it ran of memory. The technology got stuck there for a while, until someone thought “how about we train it so that <DONE> is an increasingly likely output the longer the loop goes on? Then, when it eventually says <DONE>, we’ll stop pumping it back into the input and send it to the user.” Booya, a trillion dollars for everyone but them.It’s truly so remarkable that it gets me stuck in an infinite philosophical loop in my own head, but seeing how it works the idea of ‘think’, ‘reason’, ‘understand’ or any of those words becomes silly.

We’ll use token==word shorthand:When you ask “What is the capital of France?” it actually only outputs: “The”That’s it. Truly, that IS the final output. It is literally a one-way algorithm that outputs a single word. It has no knowledge, memory, and it’s doesn’t know what’s next. As far as the algorithm is concerned it’s done! It outputs ONE token for any given input.Now, if you start over and put in “What is the capital of France? The” it’ll output “ “. That’s it. Between your two inputs were a million others, none of them have a plan for the conversation, it’s just one token out for whatever input.But if you start over yet again and put in “What is the capital of France? The “ it’ll output “capital”. That’s it. You see where this is going?Then someone uttered the words that have built and destroyed empires: “what if I automate this?” And so it was that the output was piped directly back into the input, probably using AutoHotKey. But oh no, it just kept adding one word at a time until it ran of memory. The technology got stuck there for a while, until someone thought “how about we train it so that <DONE> is an increasingly likely output the longer the loop goes on? Then, when it eventually says <DONE>, we’ll stop pumping it back into the input and send it to the user.” Booya, a trillion dollars for everyone but them.It’s truly so remarkable that it gets me stuck in an infinite philosophical loop in my own head, but seeing how it works the idea of ‘think’, ‘reason’, ‘understand’ or any of those words becomes silly. It’s amazing for entirely different reasons."

It's been over a year since i used Element, but I didn't like the UI at all, it felt like Teams but more clunky? perhaps the mobile app is better, I never tried it.All that said, I think it's a great system, it's perfect for government systems too. they're not usually concerned about things looking great or having cosmetic features. I would very much prefer to use it over Teams or Slack personally. So long as it handles scheduling meetings, and managing things like booking conference rooms just as well."

It would be nice if a city-builder could simulate that aspect of urban growth: The shift from village center to grid, and old grid to new grid."

I tried to do this in Cities Skylines II for awhile, building very narrow streets in \"organic\" city centers with low-to-mid density, and then transitioning to a new city grid around the old center. Finally, superimposing highways and tunnels without destroying the original historical core. There were some beautiful results, but the traffic jams were astounding, even with limits on the city center roads and highway exits. This is the way cities actually grew, so to me it's much more interesting to simulate than a \"perfect\" city built all at once. One thing that was fun in SimCity 3000 was that certain technologies didn't become available until you had a certain population. I would almost wish that a city-builder now would allow you to take that to the extreme: Spend 200 years with horse-drawn carts before you can pave a road, and then figure out what to do with the mess.

When someone asks why, especially if a child asks, the default answer should be the simplest correct answer:Because it's the color of the atmosphere, specifically nitrogen and oxygen! It's technically correct to state this.Gasp! But aren't nitrogen and oxygen usually described as \"colorless\"? Well, yes but... If they were perfectly colorless, the sky would be black. It's technically more correct to describe them as nearly colorless and very slightly blue. Very slightly because you need to see through kilometers of atmosphere to perceive the blue. It doesn't matter if the color is caused by absorption, or reflection, or (Rayleigh) scattering of certain wavelengths. The \"color\" of an object is simply the color you perceive with your eyes. If you perceive blue, it's technically correct to say its color is blue.It's like saying plants are green because green is the color of chlorophyll. And in the case of chlorophyll, the color is caused by absorption not by scattering. But the physics is irrelevant. Green is its color.Q: But sunsets/sunrises are red & orange not blue! A: the simplest answer is: color of an object can change under different light conditions. Specifically in this example, when seeing the sun through not kilometers but hundred of kilometers of atmosphere, all the blue-ish wavelengths have been scattered in random directions so only the red-ish wavelengths remain, thus the atmosphere is illuminated by progressively redder and redder light as the photons travel longer and longer distances through the atmosphere.",

In any case, they means the same thing  There's nothing ambiguous or inconsistent about this. In English a verb is transitive if it takes one or more objects in addition to the subject. In \"Anna carries a book\", \"carries\" is transitive. A verb is intransivite if it takes no object as with \"jumps\" in \"The frog jumps.\".Many verbs in English are \"ambitransitive\" where they can either take an object or not, and the meaning often shifts depending on how it's used. There is a whole category of verbs called \"labile verbs\" where the subject of the intransitive form becomes the object of the transitive form:* Intransitive: The bell rang.* Transitive: John rang the bell.\"Scatter\" is simply a labile verb:* Intransitive: Blue light scatters.* Transitive: Atmospheric molecules scatter blue light more."

That's what my code calculated (https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45512970) that's what Dr. Ulrich Deuschle also calculates (https://www.udeuschle.de/panoramas/panqueryfull.aspx?mode=ne...) You, Deuschle, and I all use the same DEM data (https://www.viewfinderpanoramas.org/Coverage%20map%20viewfin...) and the same refraction coeff (0.13), and nearly the same camera height (1.5m for me, 2.0m for Deuschle, and 1.65m for you—and these differing heights make no difference given the coarse DEM resolution). Something must be slighly off in your computations? Or do you think both Deuschle and I are wrong?Edit: to be clear the difference stems from our coordinates. Our starting points are:41.059167,77.683333 (me)41.0181,77.6708 (you)And our end points are:36.295364,78.755593 (me)36.314,78.7654 (you)Also I calculate the distance assuming the Earth is spherical (which gives 538 km) not the standard geodesic (which would give 537 km).And in the DEM data I measure the distance from the center of a cell to another (not the edge), while measuring from edge to edge may explain a difference of at most 0.1 km as the DEM resolution is 3 arcseconds.So clearly we disagree on the coordinates of the exact actual sightline as we have a 7 km difference :-)Edit #2: clearly the error is on your side. I should have checked this first, but the coordinates you give for the \"To\" point (41.0181,77.6708) land in a valley with the south view completely blocked so it's impossible to view 500+ km south as you claim.

My understanding is that they're uninterested in selling that currently 3) then all the other local issues like where will they be able to sell locals on building giant mines, dealing with the heavy traffic, potential environmental concerns, etc."

Agents do not just act, they stake on decisions. Multiple agents or agents plus humans evaluate actions independently, and bad decisions have real cost. This reduces guessing, slows risky actions, and forces higher confidence for security sensitive decisions. Execution answers what an agent can do. Consensus answers how sure we are that it should do it."

A couple notes from my first few sols:- I had a really hard time building a greenhouse, because I hadn't realized it'd be bigger than 1 square like all the previous buildings, and it just wouldn't build despite having materials etc. Maybe a footprint outline while hovering a build option?- There were a lot of instructions from Dr. Kimura right off the bat. Hard for me to remember all that, and I was hoping talking to the doc again would replay those hints.- My population seems to be stuck at 2..

Marx realized that socialism could only be build upon the massive development of productivity forces that would lead towards a post scarcity society.Which is also why actually existing socialism struggled so hard. A revolution is more likely to occur in the least developed parts of the world but that also means it will be one of the hardest places to implement socialism in.

          "content_cn": "> The last part is why all the most socially realistic depictions of societies like this are post-scarcity where they've mastered some kind of sci-fi energy source (cheap easy fusion, antimatter, tapping the zero point, etc.).Yeah, Marx already had these kind of discussions in the 19th century.It is very interesting that you arrived to similar conclusions while employing a very different methodology.Marxism evolved out of a criticism of what they call utopian socialism. Marx realized that socialism could only be build upon the massive development of productivity forces that would lead towards a post scarcity society.Which is also why actually existing socialism struggled so hard. A revolution is more likely to occur in the least developed parts of the world but that also means it will be one of the hardest places to implement socialism in.

The Large Hadron Collider (LHC) has not found any particles or forces beyond the Standard Model, defying theoretical expectations that additional particles would appear to solve the \"hierarchy problem\"—the unnatural gap between the Higgs mass and the Planck scale. This absence of new physics challenged the \"naturalness\" argument that had long guided the field.In 2012, physicist Adam Falkowski predicted the field would undergo a slow decay without new discoveries. Reviewing the state of the field in 2026, he maintains that experimental particle physics is indeed dying, citing a \"brain drain\" where talented postdocs are leaving the field for jobs in AI and data science. However, the LHC remains operational and is expected to run for at least another decade.Artificial intelligence is now being integrated into the field to improve data handling. AI pattern recognizers are classifying collision debris more accurately than human-written algorithms, allowing for more precise measurements of \"scattering amplitude\" or interaction probabilities. Some physicists, like Matt Strassler, argue that new physics might not lie at higher energies but could be hidden in \"unexplored territory\" at lower energies, such as unstable dark matter particles that decay into muon-antimuon pairs.CERN physicists have proposed a Future Circular Collider (FCC), a 91-kilometer tunnel that would triple the circumference of the LHC. The plan involves first colliding electrons to measure scattering amplitudes precisely, followed by proton collisions at energies roughly seven times higher than the LHC later in the century. Formal approval and funding for this project are not expected before 2028.Meanwhile, U.S. physicists are pursuing a muon collider. Muons are elementary particles like electrons but are 200 times heavier, allowing for high-energy, clean collisions. The challenge is that muons are highly unstable and decay in microseconds, requiring rapid acceleration. A June 2025 national report endorsed the program, which is estimated to take about 30 years to develop and cost between $10 and $20 billion.China has reportedly moved away from plans to build a massive supercollider. Instead, they are favoring a cheaper experiment costing hundreds of millions of dollars—a \"super-tau-charm facility\"—designed to produce tau particles and charm quarks at lower energies.On the theoretical side, some researchers have shifted to \"amplitudeology,\" the abstract mathematical study of scattering amplitudes, in hopes of reformulating particle physics equations to connect with quantum gravity. Additionally, Jared Kaplan, a former physicist and co-founder of the AI company Anthropic, suggests that AI progress is outpacing scientific experimentation, positing that future colliders or theoretical breakthroughs might eventually be designed or discovered by AI rather than humans.",

I've run into a lot of cases when targeting C as a compilation target where swapping something out into an always-inline function results in worse code generation, because compilers have bugs sadlyThere's also the issue in that the following two things don't have the same semantics in C:    float v = a * b + c;\n\nvs    static_inline float get_thing(float a, float b) {\n        return a*b;\n    }\n\n    float v = get_thing(a, b) + c;\n\nThis is just a C-ism (floating point contraction) that can make extracting things into always inlined functions still be a big net performance negative.

So you need a different way to write and upload, which - in my opinion - kills the whole project. YMMV.Lagrange - the most used browser - used to have something called \"Titan\" as user upload but that was never specified and nobody used it and I think it's removed from Lagrange now.edit: ah it still supports it (Titan).

The only user input is a small search query. It's intentionally set up against building any kind of BBS/Forum. So you need a different way to write and upload, which - in my opinion - kills the whole project. YMMV.Lagrange - the most used browser - used to have something called \"Titan\" as user upload but that was never specified and nobody used it and I think it's removed from Lagrange now.edit: ah it still supports it (Titan). It just seems there is no 服务器 in the world that uses it."
