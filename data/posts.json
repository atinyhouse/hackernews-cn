      "abstract": "该讨论围绕TikTok用户无法上传批评美国移民及海关执法局（ICE）视频的事件展开，公司声称是技术故障所致。社区对此提出广泛质疑，核心争议在于故障的真实性及其背后的审查动机。\n\n有人认为这可能是TikTok为配合美国政治压力而进行的系统性内容过滤，旨在向公众隐瞒国际社会普遍知晓的信息。也有用户指出，近期平台算法异常重置用户偏好，且仅涉及美国抵抗议题的视频出现规律性播放故障，怀疑这是刻意传递审查信号。讨论中提到，部分用户对比Meta旗下的Instagram Reels，认为其内容竞争性已改善，反而凸显TikTok的审查问题。\n\n尽管TikTok官方解释为数据中心停电导致的技术故障，但多数用户对此并不信服。普遍共识是平台存在政治性内容干预，分歧主要在于其程度与意图：一方认为这是企业为规避监管的被动妥协，另一方则视其为主动配合信息管控的警示信号。历史类比（如1989年捷克斯洛伐克事件）和“煮蛙效应”等隐喻被频繁引用，反映社区对数字审查蔓延的深切忧虑。",

It was fixed (for his videos) after contacting somebody on the technical side of Youtube, but there was never an explanation AFAIK of what actually went wrong, so I was left pondering if that could be a result of some more ambitious ML-experiments in attempt to improve compression rates or something, but never found out conclusively.",

They are gonna work extra overtime to cool it down some for now, collect & put some frogs back in the pot. And then slowly turn up the heat again.I also do believe this is an incredibly hard technical moment. Elli-Tok has nearly no chance of suceeding in building their own algorithm, from square 1, since they don't have access to the ByteDance algorithms. I don't know what access they have to international content and internstional viewing habits, don't know if US content flows to TikTok actual and if they get any algorithmic help from that. This feels like a suicidal business, buying a brand name but lacking any and all of the means to maintain product quality.There probably are real technical problems here. And feed preferences are probably just gone, while Elli-Tok rebuilds its own perhaps isolated perhaps loosely connected fork, while as said above probably lacking the content and viewer data to work from.But just as Ellison's bought CBS then let it be overrun & destroyed by the hollow Free Press propogandists (pretending to be neutral, I say as my eyes roll out of my head), I also tend to think they thought they could get away with doing what they want. Maybe they will get away with this project. Maybe it is all isolated US only content, maybe it is swamped with right wing agitprop from here on out. Maybe half those viewers here keep scrolling forever and that's good enough to make the incredibly fantastically rich happy with their US government facilitated acquisition, that sundering an interesting diverse well tuned network is maybe or maybe not a delight but a necessary thing to claw under for this desired class propoganda. But I tend to think they're alas probably smart enough to learn quickly this is not how you boil a frog, and tend to think Elli-Tok is going to (suck for a long while either way, but work to) dial down the right wingism & divisionism a lot, then slowly work it back up.(But man, watching these buffons mishandle CBS, watching ridiculous  bald faced \"salute to Mark Rubio\" sure makes it hard to  believe they have any competence at all.)Different topic but the extremely critical TikTok v.

They have forgotten the idea that our justice system was supposed to hold true to: \"better a hundred guilty go free than one innocent person suffer\" (attributed to Benjamin Franklin).This can be seen in the case of ChongLy Thao, the American citizen (who was born in Laos). This was the man dragged out into freezing temperatures in his underwear after ICE knocked down his door (without a warrant), because they thought two other men (of Thai origin I think) were living there. The ICE agents attitude was that they must be living there, and ChongLy was hiding them. That being wrong does not cost those ICE agents anything, and that is the source of the problems.",

[1] I actually do believe there is value in thinking this way and it is one of my biggest arguments against TSA. Everything has a cost, including 'security' and 'safety'. If you look at the very real human toll, and economic toll, that airport security has caused any potential gain is out the window in just one day of costs from screening, and that doesn't even get into the privacy destruction this has caused. I think I would get way to angry to comment on that in an intelligent way.But that is just one argument. My real anger at airport screening is that we have found it possible to fund and implement this level of screening, at massive monetary, human and privacy cost, but I can't go to my doctor and for a few pennies (sorry, those don't exist now, how about for a few nickles?) get a body scan that does all the 3d segmentation, recognition, etc etc etc. We could actually save lives if we put effort into this technology for people instead of for a sense of security. But we probably won't. Because fear gets money but solving real problems that actually impact people doesn't.[1] https://danemcfarlane.com/how-steve-jobs-turned-boot-time-in...",

You miss it, you wait another week.- The terminal is extremely small, the plane that comes around can probably fit around 180 pax, you could not fit that many people on the check-in lounge, which means a lot of times people have to queue outside, even in the winter.- Check in is sluggish, with the Airline representatives in the Falklands calling for check in 4 hours in advance when a flight is full.- After getting your ticket, security will check your bags and you will be asked to wait an undetermined amount of time, to see if a \"random\" check need to take place, again, the terminal is tiny, people often crowds waiting forever for their name the be shouted by some security person.- If you manage to get passed this part, you are still not safe, security can still call your name when passing through or after immigration. Even if you are already in the wait lounge. Someone might still show up and shout your name.- Immigration will scan your passport and charge you £40 for leaving the country.- Now you are actually commit to the security checkpoint (these are the same guys that scan the bags on check-in). At any given time there is at least 10 in a 5m2 area. You are forced to take your shoes, no liquids are allowed, no toothpaste, take all electronics out of your bag, take jacket off.- You are randomly tested for drug and explosive traces (GOING OFF THE FALKLAND ISLANDS)- You may be patted- All your belongings might be checked at this point as well.All in all, you could be looking at a 2-hour ordeal from start to finish.Do yourself a favor.

In the US, the TSA is just a government jobs program for the lowly skilled or unskilled.This is oft repeated, but as a federal job, the bar is at least slightly higher than those typical AlliedUniversal/Andy Frain/Etc mall cop guards you see all over the place. I have no doubt that many are incompetent, but I think it is a big unfair that it gets singled out as a \"jobs program\" given that the bar is on the floor industrywide for security.An interesting comparison would be FPS, which is the agency that does security checks for federal buildings, also under DHS same as TSA. They are armed despite many of them having an indoor only role (a few do patrol larger campuses outdoors). Thus, I suspect the requirements are somewhat higher. They are generally more thorough in my experience, except for one time where they did not notice one of my shoes got stuck and didn't go through the X ray, which is funny because they insist on all dress shoes being scanned as they have a tiny metal bar inside. The same shoes go through TSA just fine.",

          "content": "Germany has a very sad and weak airport security story. The security personal are hired and paid by the state (Land), and thus the state plans their capacity and workflow. The airport owner (i.e. FRAport) has no say in their internal work organization, as it is basically contracted out policework. For whatever reason, most german Airports I regularly use, use the same machine and broken workflow: There is only a limited amount of containers to put your stuff in to go through the x-ray, and the machine itself has an integrated container-return system using conveyors. As a result, each machine has only a single small table with a container dispenser to serve passengers. On that tiny table, only 2-3 people at the same time can get undressed, get water out of their handlugagge etc. Waiting passengers behind them are blocked.I contrast that with my experience in Spain: Several meters before the machines, there is a large amount of unoccupied, huge tables with containers stacked everywhere, so everybody can get undressed and pack their stuff into the container trays at their pace of choice. Staff assists and tells the rules to individuall travellers. Once you are done sorting your stuff into the containers, taking off your belt etc - only THEN you take the containers towards the x-ray conveyor line. So there is hardly any blocking the line. Instead of a container-return system, a single human stacks the containers past the scan and returns them to the beginning. This is so much more effective.Classic example of government run workflows: No one cares to optimize the workflow, and the one who would benefit from a speedup (the airport and the airlines) in terms of increased sales, have no say in the process.",

I went to a wedding in Denia, a medium-sized town on the Mediterranean coast of Spain.The day after the wedding we went to a restaurant by the sea to have some hangover paella, part of the wedding celebrations. Weddings in Spain are usually 2 or 3 day affairs.\nAnyway, since we were travelling back to Madrid later that day we left our luggage in the trunk of the car, not visible from the outside. We locked the doors and off for paella.Or so we thought: some bad guys were jamming the car key frequencies so the car didn’t actually lock. They hit jackpot with my bag: my Canon IXUS camera (I loved that camera), my Kindle 3G, my MacBook Pro and my iPad… with 3G.When we found out later that day we went to the local Guardia Civil and told them the story. I opened “Find My” on my phone and told them exactly where the bad guys were, all the way in Valencia already.You should have seen the face of the two-days-shy-from-retiring officer when I told him that my iPad was connected to the internet and broadcasting its location continuously. Remember this was 2011.So they sent a police car to check out the area and found a suspiciously hot car. They noted it down and did some old-fashioned policing the rest of the summer. Two months later I got a call: they had found them and waited on them to continue stealing using the same MO, until they had a large enough stash that they could be charged with a worse crime.They had found my bag, my MacBook and my iPad. The smaller items had already been sold on the black market.It still is one of my favourite hacker stories. I went to court as a witness and retold the whole thing.

Introducing a penetrative void would destabilize the sinusoidal depleneration required for proper UWB phase conjugation. The resulting spurving bearing misalignment could induce up to 40 millidarkness of signal attenuation.\nApple’s engineers attempted to compensate using prefabulated amulite in the magneto-reluctance housing, but this only exacerbated the side-fumbling in the hyperboloid waveform generators. Early prototypes with keyring holes exhibited catastrophic unilateral dingle-arm failure within mere minutes of deployment.\nUntil we develop lotus-o-delta-type bearings capable of withstanding the differential girdle spring modulation, I’m afraid keyring integration remains firmly in the realm of theoretical engineering—right up there with perpetual motion machines and TypeScript projects that compile without any // @ts-ignore comments.\nThe technology simply isn’t there yet.",

I have been following the news closely, mostly getting my data from my friends in Iran before the internet shutdown and after it was (sort of) lifted.The death toll is way above this number, you have to consider the fact that Iran is a big country with many small cities, and in my city alone (which is very small and rarely has any protest going on) many people have died (i don’t have the exact numbers but it could be anywhere between 100 to 200) and when you put this into perspective you will understand that in scale of the entire country a lot of people have died.I have heard that not only they killed people on the street but they have chased those who fled and killded them at their places or hidings, let alone the killing of the injured ones in hospitals.It’s is a big tragedy and people are reluctant to talk about it because those who are committing this massacre are MUSLIMS and support PALESTINE so this is a moral dilemma for the left lovers! because they see Mullah’s regime as one of their biggest allies when it comes to attack West/Israel/Free marketIt’s a shame that all those activist that would shred themselves for Palestine are absolutely quite about Iran",

I always think, if the people would really be against the regime, wouldn't members of the police and military know that?Receive pressure from families and friends, even non direct one, clearly showing that the public thinks otherwise and they can easily topple those regimes? The moment your armed forces and police stops obeying orders those regimes are cooked. Yet they don't.Which means that either there is no such an internal pressure or the regimes are extraordinarily good at selecting and incentivizing people to maintain the status quo.Still, I think this is no excuse for foreign intervention and you should not do others what you don't wish on yourself. But at the same time if those regimes are indeed so effective, how do you get to help them?I wish that at least instead of unilaterally, drastic measures were first sanctioned and carried out by UN, like it used to happen few decades ago in Africa.But now it is always unilateral and stuff like what happened in Venezuela has been a tragedy imho where de facto a single country decides to topple the leadership of another one.

The more advanced and diverse an economy and the more qualified and educated the population are the more power they have. On one extreme you have countries like Angola with an economy consisting virtually only out of exporting oil. These countries only need a few qualified engineers for their resource extraction which they pay well and everyone else is entirely replaceable. That leads to extreme inequality between the leading political class that absorbs all the money and pays the military with it. As long as they pay and treat the military well enough they can just suppress the rest of the country. If people act up they can literally just kill everyone part of the rebellion. The political class, the military and the rest are just entirely disjunct classes of people with different incentives. The family of the militaries profit enough from the system to not excert pressure on their family member working for the military. It's the hand that feeds them.On the other end you have countries with highly developed, specialized economies and a population that is educated enough to understand at least a few things about politics. There ordinary people have extensive training and work experience. You cannot just replace them. They can protest and go on strike and if you start killing everyone the economy will quickly start crashing down. Just pulling a few cogs out of the massively complex machine will stop it from working. And at that point it's not just a problem for the working population but also for the owning class and the pressure will propagate all the way up through the hierarchy. Also people can just leave. They have the economic means to and their qualifications mean that other countries have an interest in attracting already qualified people without having to pay for their education and traning first. That's what happened to east Germany and why they built the wall.There are some methods of social control that can help to control a population beyond that. The key ingredient is surveillance, mutual control and seeding distrust. One person alone can never challenge the system. People need to organize. You can try to find the organizers via surveillance quick enough and get rid of them before they get dangerous. Also if a significant portion of the population is secretly informing the government people might be to afraid to organize as they distrust each other. That's how the Stasi worked in East Germany. For an extreme case of that see the Inminban[1] system in North Korea where people are bundled into groups where all surveil each other and report any dissident behavior. Failing to do so will lead to collective punishment for the whole group. It's a really perverse system that plays people against each other and their own interest aligning the incentives for the individual with the government rather than their class.[1] https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inminban",

Those not participating too much (very rare!) still millions of times more justifiable than that of people who have nothing to fear from manifesting freely and safely.The calculated cost/benefit calculation that some leftists (me one of them generally - but not in this case) are doing, is just using the wrong calibration weights, “hate for a specific faction/team” rather than just “love for humanity and justice” (which I assume people won’t argue is a leftist pillar).",

To make it worse, it didn't even bother to use the spatial partitioning and they were just brute force looking at their neighbours.Had this been a real system it might have made its way into production, which makes one think about the value of the AI code out there.

In comparison it easily implemented it 10-30x faster than I did but would never have managed to complete the project on its own.

Most academic computer scientists aren't necessarily very skilled as programmers in any case. At least, I learned most of that after I stopped being an academic myself (Ph. D. and all). This is OK. Learning to program is more of a side effect of studying computer science than it is a core goal (this is not always clearly understood).A good analogy here is programming in assembler. Manually crafting programs at the machine code level was very common when I got my first computer in the 1980s. Especially for games. By the late 90s that had mostly disappeared. Games like Roller Coaster Tycoon were one of the last ones with huge commercial success that were coded like that. C/C++ took over and these days most game studios license an engine and then do a lot of work with languages like C# or LUA.I never did any meaningful amount of assembler programming. It was mostly no longer a relevant skill by the time I studied computer science (94-99). I built an interpreter for an imaginary CPU at some point using a functional programming language in my second year. Our compiler course was taught by people like Eric Meyer (later worked on things like F# at MS) who just saw that as a great excuse to teach people functional programming instead. In hindsight, that was actually a good skill to have as functional programming interest heated up a lot about 10 years later.The point of this analogy: compilers are important tools. It's more important to understand how they work than it is to be able to build one in assembler. You'll probably never do that. Most people never work on compilers. Nor do they build their own operating systems, databases, etc. But it helps to understand how they work. The point of teaching how compilers work is understanding how programming languages are created and what their limitations are.",

The LLM can serve as a tool to get specialized insight into the grammar book and accelerate physical processes (like generating all forms of a word for writing flashcards). At the end of day, you need to make an intelligent separation where the LLM ends and your learning begins.I really like this contrast because it highlights the gap between using an LLM and actually learning.

The author incorporates and plans for those predicted reactions and thoughts where it makes sense. Ultimately the author is conveying an implicit mental model (or even evoking emotional states or sensations) to the reader.The first problem is that many of these pathways and edge cases aren’t apparent until the actual implementation, and sometimes in the process the author realizes that the overall product would work better if it were re-specified from the start. This opportunity is lost without a hands on approach.The second problem is that, the less human touch is there, the less consistent the mental model conveyed to the user is going to be, because a specification and collection of prompts does not constitute a mental model.

      "abstract": "该讨论围绕亚马逊关闭其线下生鲜超市Amazon Fresh和Go门店的新闻展开。核心话题是分析亚马逊实体零售尝试失败的原因及对其“拿了就走”技术的评价。多数用户对门店体验持负面看法，有人认为管理混乱、员工服务不足且常有过期商品，指出其解决的是亚马逊自身成本问题而非顾客需求。也有用户提到购物体验怪异，价格波动大，但初期餐食套装和Alexa集成等功能曾受好评。对于“拿了就走”技术，讨论中提到其并非全自动，依赖大量人工审核，虽被部分用户视为未来购物体验，但存在多收费等技术缺陷。分歧点在于对技术前景的评价，一方认为该技术代表未来方向，另一方则质疑其实际成熟度与可行性。共识是亚马逊此次关店源于实体店运营不佳及未能真正满足消费者需求。",

          "content": "Doesn’t surprise me.  I frequently shop at Amazon Fresh in store and it’s a mediocre experience. It’s a poorly run store with no visible manager making sure things are in order. You constantly have to work around employees fulfilling online orders and they aren’t helpful.  I always find expired groceries/produce on the shelf so I have to spend a lot of extra time inspecting each item.  The only reason I put up with their nonsense is that some of their prices are insane and they have easy returns, for example $0.85 for a box of Barilla pasta. They actually don’t accept returns in store and just refund you automatically in the app (Returnless returns).  It’s pretty silly and rife for abuse.I also found a loophole with the Amazon.com return grocery credit.  The systems are separate for the $10 off $40 coupon and you just scan a QR code in the store to get it. It  turns out you can just take a photo of their QR code and reuse it over and over again.",

It was like a 7-Eleven, but with the prices of a normal grocery store and higher quality prepared food. Not needing to deal with checkout felt freeing. I substituted many grocery store runs with a quick walk over to the original Amazon Go back in the day.After covid, it was never the same.

          "content": "The Amazon Fresh in North Seattle had Just Walk Out. Initially you had to \"scan in\" and \"scan out\" and then they eventually removed the \"scan out\" (or scan in? can't remember). From a shopper's perspective, it was pretty good, and I was hopeful they'd figure out the tech.  One time they overcharged me for a paper bag and there was no way to dispute it. It was only $0.08, but really rubbed me the wrong way. I know I got a fair bit of stuff for free as they seemed to err on the side of not charging vs. charging if they weren't able to figure it out, though.I actually did find it saved me time. I would go in, grab a couple things, and leave, and it was actually a good experience to do that. I never did full grocery store runs there, though.The aisles were always packed with workers picking/packing orders, which was frustrating to deal with.One thing that was bad about it was that produce was all fixed price. At a normal store you pay per pound for an onion, but there every onion was $1 (or whatever the price was). Giant onion, tiny onion, all the same price. The produce got picked over in weird ways because of that.Then one day they said, \"okay, Just Walk Out is gone, it's just a normal grocery store now.\" Then it just became just a mediocre grocery store. There were definitely periods where aisles could be nearly empty, but lately it's been okay. Prices were great, though -- by far the cheapest in the area.Their hot bar was extremely mediocre. I like the Whole Foods one, but theirs was just... not good. Half the time they didn't even have it stocked with food.They had a little stand up front where kids could get a free piece of fruit, which mine liked.It also had convenient returns for Amazon purchases, which was about half of what I went there for.It was a convenient place for me, and I like it better than Safeway, but I can't say I'm too heartbroken that it's going away. QFC/Sprouts/Town&Country/Safeway are a few minutes in any direction, but they're more expensive. I doubt they'll turn this one into a Whole Foods either.",

Shoplifters are unpleasant to share a store with. Unsurprisingly, those who skip some social norms also skip other ones.Anyway, I didn't go back after the first time because it was more like a corner store than a grocery store. Bags of chips and sandwiches in plastic boxes and so on. Overall, the modern Whole Foods is a much better experience. Guards at the entrance to keep unpleasant people out, a fairly quick check-out experience, and the ability to scan your palm instead of having to pull out a credit card or tap your watch.About the only improvement that I would personally like is a Fast Shopper bonus where you scan something that maps you to your Amazon Prime profile and if you finish checking out fast you get access to a faster lane. The only downside is when people with large bags of things insist on using the self check-out counters and then stand there having mis-scanned items.Speeding up check-out is a personal life improvement but realistically it would not cause me to shop more, so I understand discontinuing the store.",

      "abstract": "该讨论围绕通义千问Qwen3-Max-Thinking模型展开，核心话题聚焦于其性能表现、技术实现方式以及与Claude Opus 4.5等主流模型的对比。社区观点呈现明显分歧：部分用户肯定其工程价值，认为通过增加计算量和思维链长度提升推理能力是合理的技术路径；也有用户质疑这仅是“暴力计算”而非真正的模型进步，强调应区分技术优化与本质突破。在性能评估方面，有人认为若其基准测试表现属实，可能标志中国模型的重要拐点；同时有用户指出其在未启用搜索时表现不及Opus 4.5，但启用后反超，引发对中文互联网数据质量的讨论。讨论中普遍认同当前基准测试存在局限，如同软件工程师面试难以反映实际工作需求。多数用户期待独立第三方评测，并对模型在代码生成等具体任务中的实际效果保持关注。",

If very compute-intensive reasoning leads to very powerful AI, the world might remain the same for at least a few years even after the breakthrough because the inference compute simply cannot keep up.You might want millions of geniuses in a data center, but perhaps you can only afford one and haven't built out enough compute?

If we’re just throwing more tokens, longer chains of thought, or extra tools at the problem, that feels more like brute force than genuine progress.And that distinction matters in practice. If getting slightly better answers means using 5–10× more tokens or a bunch of external calls, the costs add up fast. That doesn’t scale well in the real world. It’s hard to call something a breakthrough when quality goes up but the bill and latency go up just as much.I also think we should be careful about reading too much into benchmarks. A lot of them reward clever prompting and tool orchestration more than actual general intelligence. Once you factor in reliability, speed, and cost, the story often looks less impressive.",

I think it said its the equivalent power of watching 5 seconds of TV per search.I also asked perplexity to give a report of the most notable ARXIV papers. This one was at the top of the list -\"The most consequential intellectual development on arXiv is Sara Hooker's \"On the Slow Death of Scaling,\" which systematically dismantles the decade-long consensus that computational scale drives progress. Hooker demonstrates that smaller models—Llama-3 8B and Aya 23 8B—now routinely outperform models with orders of magnitude more parameters, such as Falcon 180B and BLOOM 176B. This inversion suggests that the future of AI development will be determined not by raw compute, but by algorithmic innovations: instruction finetuning, model distillation, chain-of-thought reasoning, preference training, and retrieval-augmented generation. The implications are profound—progress is no longer the exclusive domain of well-capitalized labs, and academia can meaningfully compete again.\"",

I end up using it much more and paying a dear but worthwhile price for it.PS: Despite what the benchmarks say, I find Gemini 3 Pro and Flash to be a step below Claude and GPT, although still great compared to the state-of-the-art last year, and very fast and cheap. Gemini also seems to have a less AI sounding writing-style.I am aware this is all quite vague and anecdotal, just my two cents.I do think these kinds of opinions are valuable.

And there is, I think, something still very lawyerly about Donald Trump in which he is flinging accusations left and right, he’s trying to intimidate people, trying to establish guilt in the court of public opinion\n\nVery interesting take and I think insightful on why the US is the way it is today and sidesteps the democracy vs autocracy debate.[0] https://freakonomics.com/podcast/china-is-run-by-engineers-a...",

If they log the attestations and the EK->AIK conversions, the database can be used to unmask you in the future.Also note that nothing can prevent you from forging attestations if you source a private-public key pair and a valid certificate, either by extracting them from a compromised device or with help from an insider at the factory.

That will eventually force users to make a choice between being denied essential services and accepting these demands.I also think AI would substantially curtail the effect of many of these anti-user efforts.

Like if I had stated certain design goals recently it would adhere to them, but after a few iterations it would forget again and go back to its original approach, or mix the two, or whatever. Eventually it was easier just to quit fighting it and let it do things the way it wanted.What I've seen is that after the initial dopamine rush of being able to do things that would have taken much longer manually, a few iterations of this kind of interaction has slowly led to a disillusionment of the whole project, as AI keeps pushing it in a direction I didn't want.I think this is especially true if you're trying to experiment with new approaches to things. LLMs are, by definition, biased by what was in their training data. You can shock them out of it momentarily, whish is awesome for a few rounds, but over time the gravitational pull of what's already in their latent space becomes inescapable.

I've been recently exploring using claude code/codex recently as the \"default\", so I've decided to implement a side project.My gripe with AI tools in the past is that the kind of work I do is large and complex and with previous models it just wasn't efficient to either provide enough context or deal with context rot when working on a large application - especially when that application doesn't have a million examples online.I've been trying to implement a multiplayer game with server authoritative networking in Rust with Bevy. I specifically chose Bevy as the latest version was after Claude's cut off, it had a number of breaking changes, and there aren't a lot of deep examples online.Overall it's going well, but one downside is that I don't really understand the code \"in my bones\". If you told me tomorrow that I had optimize latency or if there was a 1 in 100 edge case, not only would I not know where to look, I don't think I could tell you how the game engine works.In the past, I could not have ever gotten this far without really understanding my tools. Today, I have a semi functional game and, truth be told, I don't even know what an ECS is and what advantages it provides. I really consider this a huge problem: if I had to maintain this in production, if there was a SEV0 bug, am I confident enough I could fix it? Or am I confident the model could figure it out? Or is the model good enough that it could scan the entire code base and intuit a solution? One of these three questions have to be answered or else brain atrophy is a real risk.",

Yes, producing the outcome is important, but the journey taken to get there is a lot of fun for me.I used Claude Code to implement a OpenAI 4o-vision powered receipt scanning feature in an expense tracking tool I wrote by hand four years ago. It did it in two or three shots while taking my codebase into account.It was very neat, and it works great [^0], but I can't latch onto the idea of writing code this way. Powering through bugs while implementing a new library or learning how to optimize my test suite in a new language is thrilling.Unfortunately (for me), it's not hard at all to see how the \"builders\" that see code as a means to an end would LOVE this, and businesses want builders, not crafters.In effect, knowing the fundamentals is getting devalued at a rate I've never seen before.[^0] Before I used Claude to implement this feature, my workflow for processing receipts looked like this: Tap iOS Shortcut, enter the amount, snap a pic of the receipt, type up the merchant, amount and description for the expense, then have the shortcut POST that to my expenses tracking toolkit which, then, POSTs that into a Google Sheet. This feature amounted the need for me to enter the merchant and amount. Unfortunately, it often took more time to confirm that the merchant, amount and date details OpenAI provided were correct (and correct it when details were wrong, which was most of the the time) than it did to type out those details manually, so I just went back to my manual workflow. However, the temptation to just glance at the details and tap \"This looks correct\" was extremely high, even if the info it generated was completely wrong! It's the perfect analogue to what I've been witnessing throughout the rise of the LLMs.",

It's been a couple years, so if it really helps then we should see it by now.So, either LLM-assisted coding is not delivering the benefits some thought it would, or Microsoft, despite being an early investor in OpenAI, is not using it much internally on things that really matter to them (like Windows).

You get a combinatorial explosion if you need to test on 100 different configurations for hardware and you have 100 different starting points in your pre-update OS image.

The issues are more subtle, the volume is greater, and there is no human reasoning chain to follow when debugging.So you combine that with a company that has staff in low skill regions, and uses outsourcing, and while there might be some high skill teams that got a speed up, the org is structured in a way that its irrelevant.",

That would have been unheard of in 2010.You can even play a huge number of Windows games on Linux, and the most popular PC “console” is a Linux system from Valve (with another releasing this year). Microsoft has no control over the PC gaming market like it did back in the heyday of DirectX.I think Microsoft should be all-hands-on-deck trying to build reasons for customers to use Windows.I personally think Windows 11 is pretty good and is the most “going in the right direction” version we’ve seen in a long time, but it could be better.

In both cases, my question to each was, \"What computer? Mine, or do you have your own?\" Here I had thought they were computers, in the vague Star Trek sense. I'm just using the free version in the browser, so I would have been surprised if it had been able to use my computer.They had their own, and I could watch them script something up in Python to run the calculations I was looking for. It made me wonder who it was at Google/Anthropic who first figured out that the way to get LLMs to stop wetting their metaphorical pants when asked to do calculations was to give them a computer to use.It did make me scratch my head when I was trying to prompt Nano Banana to generate something and it was like Gemini started talking about the image generator in the third person: \"The AI is getting stuck on the earlier instruction, even though we've now abandoned that approach.\" Felt a little \"turtles all the way down\" with that one!",

One example was a submission their undergraduate affiliation (in accounting) to submit a paper on cosmology, entirely vibe-coded and vibe-written. This just wastes our (already stretched) time.

Now, I think WD-40 is a brand name that can be trusted to work well more often than most alternatives but that is more about process than recipe (I would think).I've long thought that every restaurant/bakery/etc could publish their full internal cookbooks and not see a drop in sales. People don't buy it because they are incapable (or think they are) of making something, they do it because it's faster, they don't have all the ingredients, they don't have the time, they don't have the skill, the list goes on. I bet I could give the instructions, the equipment, and the ingredients to people and they'd still choose to buy it. Sure, you might lose a tiny bit of sales to \"home bakers\" [0] but I think it'd be eclipsed by people that saw/read/heard about the cookbook (maybe never even saw it) and that was enough \"marketing\" to get them in the door.I've always found \"secret knowledge\" to be a little silly. A sort of, security through obscurity. Knowing a recipe doesn't make you special, being able to build/run a company around it and make it consistently good does.[0] I love to cook, I sometimes like making copy-cat recipes. I cannot think of a copy-cat recipe that I made more than 2-3 times. While it's fun to do, it's never exactly the same, and I also believe that \"food tastes better when someone else makes it\". Also it can sometimes be just-as or more expensive to make some food items due to needing a bunch of ingredients that they don't sell in exactly the quantity the recipe calls for.",

What it is good at is drying off metal parts, and as a mediocre and cheap rust remover.If I accidentally leave some pliers or my socket set out in the rain, I soak them with WD-40, scrub off the rust with a wire brush, and wipe off the excess with a towel. It does a decent job of preventing further damage. If I have some rusty parts sometimes I'll throw them in a glass jar, soak 'em with WD-40, shake them around, let them sit for a day or so, and then scrub them with a wire brush. Gets most of the rust off.If you want a lubricant, just buy the correct one for the job. Silicone oil, lithium grease, graphite, all will do a better job in the long run than WD-40 if you use them in their intended role. My goto \"universal lube\" personally is \"Super Lube\", a PTFE-based lubricant which is NSF rated for incidental contact with food and dielectric.",

One reason is that most lubrication needs are actually quite low performance, and you could probably use practically anything. People use WD-40 because they have it around, and this adds to the list of its uses.It's essentially a mixture of mineral spirits and oil. Used as a lubricant, the mineral spirits evaporate, leaving the oil behind. It might be enough oil to keep a mechanism working for a while, or it might not be.It's a \"water displacer.\" Oil displaces water, who knew?It comes in a spray can, so you can get it into things like a bike shift lever.

The key part is that you don't need to manually create or prompt sub-agents, K2.5 creates them automatically, so from the looks of things it's similar to Claude Code dynamic sub-agents except the model is trained to scale to many more agents autonomously.I wonder whether Claude is doing the same kind of training and it's coming with the next model, and that's why the agent swarm mode in Claude Code is hidden for now. We might be getting very very good agent orchestrators/swarms very soon.",

The receiver and the transmitter are part of the same electric circuit in a certain sense.  It's a virtual circuit but the entire thing - transmitter and receiving unit alike - are oscillating in unison driven by a single clock.The image is never entirely realized as a complete thing, either.  While slow phosphor tubes do display a static image, most CRT systems used extremely fast phosphors; they release the majority of the light within a millisecond of the beam hitting them.  If you take a really fast exposure of a CRT display (say 1/100,000th of a second) you don't see the whole image on the photograph - only the most recently few drawn lines glow.   The image as a whole never exists at the same time.  It exists only in the persistence of vision.",

On almost every service call, I'd show up and 95% of the time, without fail, they'd either be watching Fox News, CNN, or CNBC. It was quite depressing to see 24/7 news stations had completely consumed their lives and became the majority of topics of conversation while I was there.I eventually quit the job. I decided I didn't want to be a part of making our society worse by installing these devices that were causing manufactured outrage, hate, and selective truth telling.Soon after I left, I found a book while thrifting that came out in 1978 called \"Four Arguments for the Elimination of Television\" by Jerry Mander. I laughed at the title and couldn't believe someone was already arguing for the detriments of TV before I was born. It's very well written and the points he makes are still relevant today.From the wikipedia - https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Four_Arguments_for_the_Elimina...Mander believes that \"television and democratic society are incompatible\" due to television removing all of society's senses except for seeing and hearing. The author states that television makes it so that people have no common sense which leads to...being \"powerless to reject the camera's line of sight, reset the stage, or call on our own sensory apparatus to correct the doctored sights and sounds the machine delivers\".Mander's four arguments in the book to eliminate television are:1. that telecommunication removes the sense of reality from people,2. television promotes capitalism,3. television can be used as a scapegoat, and4. that all three of these issues negatively work together.",

          "content": "I've sometimes wondered how things would have been different if the TV pioneers had went with circular CRTs instead of rounded rectangles.Circles would have had a couple of advantages. First, I believe they would have been easier to make. From what I've read rectangles have more stress at the corners. Rounding the corners reduces that but it is still more than circles have. With circles they could have more easily made bigger CRTs.Second, there is no aspect ratio thus avoiding the whole problem of picking an aspect ratio.Electronically the signals to the XY deflectors to scan a spiral out from the center (or in from the edge if you prefer) on a circle are as easy to make as the signals to to scan in horizontal lines on a rectangle.As far as I can tell that would have been fine up until we got computers and wanted to use TV CRTs as computer displays. I can't imagine how to build a bitmapped interface for such a CRT that would not be a complete nightmare to deal with.",

PAL televisions (the color TV standard in Europe) actually do store one full horizontal scanline at a time, before any of it is drawn on the screen. This is due to a clever encoding used in this format where the TV actually needs to average two successive scan lines (phase-shifted compared to each other) to draw them. Supposedly this cancels out some forms of distortion. It is quite fascinating this was even possible with analogue technology. The line is stored in a delay line for 64 microseconds.\nSee e.g.: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bsk4WWtRx6M",

On Saturday mornings it would be cartoons (including the first full-CGI television shows, Reboot and Transformers: Beast Wars), Wednesday evenings would be Star Trek: TNG, Fridays would be the TGIF block of family shows (from early-to-mid-90s USA perspective here). It felt like everyone watched the same thing, everyone had something to talk about from last night's episode, and there was a common connection over what we watched as entertainment.We saw a resurgence of this connection with big-budget serials like Game of Thrones, but now every streaming service has their own must-watch thing and it's basically as if everyone had their own personal broadcast station showing something different. I don't know if old-school television was healthy for society or not, but I do have a feeling of missing out on that shared connection lately.",

From https://www.tvtechnology.com/opinions/hdtv-from-1925-to-1994In the United States in 1935, the Radio Corporation of America demonstrated a 343-line television system. In 1936, two committees of the Radio Manufacturers Association (RMA), which is now known as the Consumer Electronics Association, proposed that U.S. television channels be standardized at a bandwidth of 6 MHz, and recommended a 441-line, interlaced, 30 frame-per-second television system. The RF modulation system proposed in this recommendation used double-sideband, amplitude-modulated transmission, limiting the video bandwidth it was capable of carrying to 2.5 MHz. In 1938, this RMA proposal was amended to employ vestigial-sideband (VSB) transmission instead of double sideband. In the vestigial-sideband approach, only the upper sidebands-those above the carrier frequency-plus a small segment or vestige of the lower sidebands, are transmitted. VSB raised the transmitted video bandwidth capability to 4.2 MHz. Subsequently, in 1941, the first National Television Systems Committee adopted the vestigial sideband system using a total line rate of 525 lines that is used in the United States today.",

It also had features like alternating the phase of every other line to reduce the \"tint\" or \"never twice the same color\" problem that NTSC hadAmerica chose 30fps but then had to slow it by 1/1001ths to avoid interference.Of course because by the 90s and the growth of digital, there was already far too much stuff expecting \"29.97\"hz so it remained, again for backward compatibility.",

          "content": ">The goal is, that xfwl4 will offer the same functionality and behavior as xfwm4 does...I wonder how strictly they interpret behavior here given the architectural divergence?As an example, focus-stealing prevention. In xfwm4 (and x11 generally), this requires complex heuristics and timestamp checks because x11 clients are powerful and can aggressively grab focus. In wayland, the compositor is the sole arbiter of focus, hence clients can't steal it, they can only request it via xdg-activation. Porting the legacy x11 logic involves the challenge of actually designing a new policy that feels like the old heuristic but operates on wayland's strict authority model.This leads to my main curiosity regarding the raw responsiveness of xfce. On potato hardware, xfwm4 often feels snappy because it can run as a distinct stacking window manager with the compositor disabled. Wayland, by definition forces compositing. While I am not concerned about rust vs C latency (since smithay compiles to machine code without a GC), I am curious about the mandatory compositing overhead. Can the compositor replicate the input-to-pixel latency of uncomposited x11 on low-end devices or is that a class of performance we just have to sacrifice for the frame-perfect rendering of wayland?",

I've become a huge fan of KDE over the past couple of years, but it certainly isn't what you would consider lightweight or minimal.Personally, I'm a big proponent of Wayland and not big Rust detractor, so I don't see any problem with this. I do, however, wonder how many long-time XFCE fans and the folks who donated the money funding this will feel about it. To me the reasoning is solid: Wayland appears to be the future, and Rust is a good way to help avoid many compositor crashes, which are a more severe issue in Wayland (though it doesn't necessarily need to be fatal, FWIW.) Still I perceive a lot of XFCE's userbase to be more \"traditional\" and conservative about technologies, and likely to be skeptical of both Wayland and Rust, seeing them as complex, bloated, and unnecessary.Of course, if they made the right choice, it should be apparent in relatively short order, so I wish them luck.",

This project was able to evaluate alternatives and decide the smithay is the best fit both for features and language choice.

The X11 diehards will go the way of the SysV-init diehards; some weird minority that likes to scream about the good old days on web forums but really no one cares about.There are good reasons to switch to Wayland, and I trust the XFCE team to handle the transition well.

There s GEM buffer management and DMA-BUF to manage and move around video & regular memory, there's kernel mode setting, there's incredibly good mesa drivers.X didn't have any of that to build from. It basically was a second kernel, was the OS that dealt with the video card atop the OS actual. It talked to the PCI device & did everything.Part of the glory of Wayland is that we have fantastic really good OS abstractions & drivers. When we go to make a display server, we start at such a different level now. Trying to layer X's abstractions atop is messy & ugly & painful, because it mostly inhibits devs from being able to use the hardware in neat efficient clean direct modern ways. You have to write an X extension that coexists with a patchwork of other extensions that slots into the X way, that can figure out how to leverage the hardware. With Wayland, most compositors just use the kernel objects. There's much less intermediary, much less cruft, much less wild indirection & accretion to cut a path for.And as you beautifully state, competing libraries can decide what abstractions & techniques work for them. There's an ecosystem of ideas, a flux to optimize hone & improve, on a variety of different dimensions. The Bazaar free to find its way vs the one giant ancient Cathedral. It's just so so so good we're finally not all trapped inside.Tl;dr: Wayland has a much higher level that it can start from. And trying to use gpu's & hardware well in X was a nightmare because X has a sea of abstractions - extensions that you had to target & develop around, making development in X a worst of both worlds low level but having to cope with a so many high level constructs you had to navigate through.",

          "content": "> Can the compositor replicate the input-to-pixel latency of uncomposited x11 on low-end devices or is that a class of performance we just have to sacrifice for the frame-perfect rendering of wayland?I think this is ultimately correct. The compositor will have to render a frame at some point after the VBlank signal, and it will need to render with it the buffers on-screen as of that point, which will be from whatever was last rendered to them.This can be somewhat alleviated, though. Both KDE and GNOME have been getting progressively more aggressive about \"unredirecting\" surfaces into hardware accelerated DRM planes in more circumstances. In this situation, the unredirected planes will not suffer compositing latency, as their buffers will be scanned out by the GPU at scanout time with the rest of the composited result. In modern Wayland, this is accomplished via both underlays and overlays.There is also a slight penalty to the latency of mouse cursor movement that is imparted by using atomic DRM commits. Since using atomic DRM is very common in modern Wayland, it is normal for the cursor to have at least a fraction of a frame of added latency (depending on many factors.)I'm of two minds about this. One, obviously it's sad. The old hardware worked perfectly and never had latency issues like this. Could it be possible to implement Wayland without full compositing? Maybe, actually. But I don't expect anyone to try, because let's face it, people have simply accepted that we now live with slightly more latency on the desktop. But then again, \"old\" hardware is now hardware that can more often than not, handle high refresh rates pretty well on desktop. An on-average increase of half a frame of latency is pretty bad with 60 Hz: it's, what, 8.3ms? But half a frame at 144 Hz is much less at somewhere around 3.5ms of added latency, which I think is more acceptable. Combined with aggressive underlay/overlay usage and dynamic triple buffering, I think this makes the compositing experience an acceptable tradeoff.What about computers that really can't handle something like 144 Hz or higher output? Well, tough call. I mean, I have some fairly old computers that can definitely handle at least 100 Hz very well on desktop. I'm talking Pentium 4 machines with old GeForce cards. Linux is certainly happy to go older (though the baseline has been inching up there; I think you need at least Pentium now?) but I do think there is a point where you cross a line where asking for things to work well is just too much. At that point, it's not a matter of asking developers to not waste resources for no reason, but asking them to optimize not just for reasonably recent machines but also to optimize for machines from 30 years ago. At a certain point it does feel like we have to let it go, not because the computers are necessarily completely obsolete, but because the range of machines to support is too wide.Obviously, though, simply going for higher refresh rates can't fix everything. Plenty of laptops have screens that can't go above 60 Hz, and they are forever stuck with a few extra milliseconds of latency when using a compositor. It is unideal, but what are you going to do? Compositors offer many advantages, it seems straightforward to design for a future where they are always on.",

We now have Gnome, Plasma, wlroots, weston, and smithay as completely separate entities. Dealing with low-level graphics is an extremely difficult topic, and every implementor encounters the same problems and has to come up with independent solutions. There's so much duplicated effort.

          "content": "> Literally no user cares what language a project is implemented inI think this is true but also maybe not true at the same time.For one thing, programming languages definitely come with their own ecosystems and practices that are common.Sometimes, programming languages can be applied in ways that basically break all of the \"norms\" and expectations of that programming language. You can absolutely build a bloated and slow C application, for example, so just using C doesn't make something minimal or fast. You can also write extremely reliable C code; sqlite is famously C after all, so it's clearly possible, it just requires a fairly large amount of discipline and technical effort.Usually though, programs fall in line with the norms. Projects written in C are relatively minimal, have relatively fewer transitive dependencies, and are likely to contain some latent memory bugs. (You can dislike this conclusion, but if it really weren't true, there would've been a lot less avenues for rooting and jailbreaking phones and other devices.)Humans are clearly really good at stereotyping, and pick up on stereotypes easily without instruction. Rust programs have a certain \"feel\" to them; this is not delusion IMO, it's likely a result of many things, like the behaviors of clap and anywho/Rust error handling leaking through to the interface. Same with Go. Even with languages that don't have as much of a monoculture, like say Python or C, I think you can still find that there are clusters of stereotypes of sorts that can predict program behavior/error handling/interfaces surprisingly well, that likely line up with specific libraries/frameworks. It's totally possible to, for example, make a web page where there are zero directly visible artifacts of what frameworks or libraries were used to make it. Yet despite that, when people just naturally use those frameworks, there are little \"tells\" that you can pick up on a lot of the time. You ever get the feeling that you can \"tell\" some application uses Angular, or React? I know I have, and what stuns me is that I am usually right (not always; stereotypes are still only stereotypes, after all.)So I think that's one major component of why people care about the programming language that something is implemented in, but there's also a few others:- Resources required to compile it. Rust is famously very heavy in this regard; compile times are relatively slow. Some of this will be overcome with optimization, but it still stands to reason that the act of compiling Rust code itself is very computationally expensive compared to something as simple as C.- Operational familiarity. This doesn't come into play too often, but it does come into play. You have to set a certain environment variable to get Rust to output full backtraces, for example. I don't think it is part of Rust itself, but the RUST_LOG environment variable is used by multiple libraries in the ecosystem.- Ease of patching. Patching software written in Go or Python, I'd argue, is relatively easy. Rust, definitely can be a bit harder. Changes that might be possible to shoehorn in in other languages might be harder to do in Rust without more significant refactoring.- Size of the resulting programs. Rust and Go both statically link almost all dependencies, and don't offer a stable ABI for dynamic linking, so each individual Rust binary will contain copies of all of their dependencies, even if those dependencies are common across a lot of Rust binaries on your system. Ignoring all else, this alone makes Rust binaries a lot larger than they could be. But outside of that, I think Rust winds up generating a lot of code, too; trying to trim down a Rust wasm binary tells you that the size cost of code that might panic is surprisingly high.So I think it's not 100% true to say that people don't care about this at all, or that only people who are bored and like to argue on forums ever care. (Although admittedly, I just spent a fairly long time typing this to argue about it on a forum, so maybe it really is true.)",

Yet, it is the only hope for India to climb at least slightly even if they can never hope to get to the frontier of mfg. Chinese goals now are to amortize their existing mfg investments in any way possible but they still find it difficult to spur domestic consumption",

It's now known that almost every pay level and skill (or lack thereof) of job was eligible under the new rules, with some countries of origin, like Zimbabwe, having up to 10 dependents per worker on average IIRC. The same story has played out in the US with the \"skilled\" H1B visa scheme. People have lost all trust in governments to architect immigration laws in the interest of the natives, rather than giving big business carte blanche to import their own replacement workforce who will do any available job for the national minimum wage.",

I know that doesn't sound like a surprising result when it's said that way, but the point is that the rest is a convenient fiction the wealthy tell themselves and politicians tell the public, in order to serve themselves.In the US for example, those policies have led to historic increases in wealth for the few, and stagnated wages for the many. On the other hand, in less well off economies such as China and Brazil, the policies led to historic numbers lifted out of poverty - far more than anything in history. So that's a great result that we absolutely should not ignore or put a stop to. I support free trade.But if the policy isn't specifically designed to benefit workers in the US, for example, if they are left to get theoretical second or third order theoretical benefits, it won't work for them.

The author of the original theory died 30 years before plate tectonics was even considered possible.Germ theory was dismissed for most of Louis Pasteur's lifetime, despite being able to literally show people yeast in a microscope.Helicentrism has a storied past.Quantum theory was also denied heavily at first. Now it saves photos to our hard drives.And how many times has the earliest dates of hominids and tool use and human thresholds of development been pushed back by tens of thousands of years?This is not an exhaustive list, by any means.So we have ancient examples and modern ones - and everything in between. So the level of education or scientific progress or equipment are not the cause. Humans are. Humans do this all the time. So until overwhelming evidence surfaces, which can take decades or longer, claims like this shouldn't be dismissed out of hand until proven solidly in error. A theory is a theory, so let it be a theory.",

When I commented that silencing the exception could lead to uncaught bugs it replies \"You're absolutely right, remove the try-catch\" which I of course never added\n* Us using python 3.14 is a logic error as \"python 3.14 does not exist yet\"\n* \"Review the async/await patterns\nHeavy use of async in model validation might indicate these should be application services instead.\" whatever this vague sentence means. Not sure if it is suggesting us changing the design pattern used in our entire code base.Also the \"confidence\" score added to each PR being 4/5 or something due to these irrelevant comments was a really annoying feature IMO. In general AI tools giving a rating when they're wrong feels like a big productivity loss as then the human reviewer will see that number and think something is wrong with the PR.--Before this we were running Coderabbit which worked really well and caught a lot of bugs / implementation gotchas. It also had \"learnings\" which it referenced frequently so it seems like it actually did not repeat commenting on intentional things in our code base. With Coderabbit I found myself wanting to read the low confidence comments as well since they were often useful (so too quiet instead of too noisy). Unfortunately our entire Coderabbit integration just stopped working one day and since then we've been in a long back and forth with their support.--I'm not sure what the secret sauce is but it feels like Greptile was GPT 3.5-tier and Coderabbit was Sonnet 4.5-tier.",

Developers make the final call.(Just this idea makes it less annoying and stops devs going down rabbit holes because it it pretty good at thinking why it might be wrong)- Prompt it to be critical but not pedantic - Focus on REAL problems that matter (bugs, security, performance), not style nitpicks that linters handle.- Get the team to run it on the command line just before each commit. Small, focused reviews not after batching 10 commits. Small diffs get better feedback.Smart Context Gathering- Full file contents, not just diffs - The tool reads complete changed files plus 1-level-deep imports to understand how changed code interacts with the codebase.Prompt Engineering- Diff-first, context-second - The diff is marked as \"REVIEW THIS\" while context files are explicitly marked \"DO NOT REVIEW - FOR UNDERSTANDING ONLY\" to prevent false positives on unchanged code. BUT that extra context makes a huge difference in correctness.- Structured output format - Emoji-prefixed bullets ( Critical,  Major,  Minor), max 3 issues per section, no fluff or praise.- Explicit \"Do NOT\" list - Prevents common AI review mistakes: don't flag formatting (Prettier handles it), don't flag TypeScript errors (IDE shows them), don't repeat issues across files, don't guess line numbers.Final note- Also plugged it in to a github action for last pass, but again non blocking.",

Some extra compare/contrast:- The build quality of each are excellent. The touchpad on the G1a is probably the closest to a MacBook touchpad I've seen and it even manages to boast an OLED screen. On the other hand, the G1a is only available as a 14\" option.- Strix Halo will still leave you wishing it were Apple Silicon in pretty much every case except \"I need to run a x86 native app/VM\". It's certainly the best alternative, but you definitely trade away to go to it. You can load large LLMs (I have the 128 GB version for non-AI reasons) but they only run ~3x faster than a laptop without a GPU would because 256 GB/s still ends up being a big bandwidth limit. If you do actually do this regularly, then prepare to hear the fans and look for your power adapter as it does get quite hot doing so.- Speaking of power adapter... you need either a 100 W or 140 W charger + USB C to be able to charge the G1a while you use it. If you want to use a lower wattage adapter you need to power off, or it seems to draw 0 W out of spite.- It's massively refreshing to have a normal UEFI bootup process, and as long as you have a current kernel the hardware support is indeed pretty great on the G1a. Between the two, the G1a has better supported than the M1 w/ Asahi - as one would expect for a corporation officially supporting Linux vs a fan project.If I were to do it all again, I'd say I might have either just gotten an M2 Pro for Asahi or an M4 w/ macOS and a Linux VM as needed. Part of going for an x86 laptop was to be able to dual boot into games with strict DRM, but after trying multiple versions of AMD graphics driver for the 8060s it was more a frustration in random stutters and I ended up not gaming on it as much as I have on other laptops anyways.

That way, whenever you're asked for Ctrl, which is all the time, you can always safely hit Cmd with no need for extra configuration. You can then remap various things in KDE Shortcuts to be more Mac like, like Cmd+Q, Cmd+Tab, Cmd+`, etc. (The only thing lacking is the Ctrl v. Cmd separation in a terminal, so I manually remapped all the Ctrl sequences in my terminal emulator to Win sequences, which matches my hardware Ctrl key. So, like on a Mac, Cmd+C works to copy, Ctrl+C is the escape code.)This works for a Mac keyboard. For a Windows keyboard, you'd have to shuffle Alt -> Ctrl, Win -> Alt, and Ctrl -> Win. There are settings for this in xkb. (KDE surfaces these in its Keyboard settings panel.)Keyboard layouts/shortcuts are a huge pain point with Linux. xkb is geriatric, and acts as such. Compose keys are flaky and inconsistent across applications. Virtually all Linux software is going to default to some idiosyncratic take on Windows shortcuts, often without much by way of customisability.

Unsurprisingly, it turns out that you can't reliably take a concept as broad as health and reduce it to a number. We see the same arguments over and over with body fat percentages, vo2 max estimates, BMI, lactate thresholds, resting heart rate, HRV, and more. These are all useful metrics, but it's important to consider them in the proper context that each of them deserve.This article gave an LLM a bunch of health metrics and then asked it to reduce it to a single score, didn't tell us any of the actual metric values, and then compared that to a doctor's opinion. Why anyone would expect these to align is beyond my understanding.The most obvious thing that jumps out to me is that I've noticed doctors generally, for better or worse, consider \"health\" much differently than the fitness community does. It's different toolsets and different goals. If this person's VO2 max estimate was under 30, that's objectively a poor VO2 max by most standards, and an LLM trained on the internet's entire repository of fitness discussion is likely going to give this person a bad score in terms of cardio fitness. But a doctor who sees a person come in who isn't complaining about anything in particular, moves around fine, doesn't have risk factors like age or family history, and has good metrics on a blood test is probably going to say they're in fine cardio health regardless of what their wearable says.I'd go so far to say this is probably the case for most people.

The most notorious of which is BMI; it is practically a category error to infer someone's health or risk by individual BMI, and yet doing so remains widespread amongst people that are supposed to know better.Instrumentation and testing become primarily useful at an individual level to explain or investigate someone's disease or disorder, or to screen for major risk factors, and the hazards and consequences of unnecessary testing outweigh the benefits in all but a few cases.  For which your GP and/or government will (or should) routinely screen those at actual risk, which is why I pooped in a jar last week and mailed it.An athlete chasing an ever-better VO2max or FTP hasn't necessarily got it wrong, however. We can say something like, \"Bjorn Daehlie’s results are explained by extraordinary VO2max\", with an implication that you should go get results some other way because you're not a five-sigma outlier.  But at the pointy end of elite sport, there's a clear correlation between marginal improvement of certain measures and competitive outcomes, and if you don't think the difference of 0.01sec between first and third matters then you've never stood on a podium. Or worse, next to one. When mistakes are made and performance deteriorates, it's often due to chasing the wrong metric(s) for the athlete at hand, generally a failure of coaching.",

Apple says its cardio fitness measures have been validated, but independent researchers have found those estimates can run low — by an average of 13 percent.There's plenty of blame to go around for everyone, but at least for some of it (such as the above) I think the blame more rests on Apple for falsely representing the quality of their product (and TFA seems pretty clearly to be blasting OpenAI for this, not others like Apple).What would you expect the behavior of the AI to be?  Should it always assume bad data or potentially bad data?  If so, that seems like it would defeat the point of having data at all as you could never draw any conclusions from it.  Even disregarding statistical outliers, it's not at all clear what part of the data is \"good\" vs \"unrealiable\" especially when the company that collected that data claims that it's good data.",

I think on the whole they are well positioned to provide massive benefit to their patients.I will also preface this with saying I do not think any LLM is better than the average doctor and that you are far better served going to your doctor than asking ChatGPT what your health is like on any factor.But I'll also say that the quality of doctors varies massively, and that a good amount of doctors learn what they learn in school and do not keep up with the latest advances in research, particularly those that have broad spectrums such as GPs. LLMs that search scientific literature, etc., might point you in the direction of this research that the doctors are not aware of. Or hallucinate you into having some random disease that impacts 3 out of every million people and send you down a rabbithole for months.Unfortunately, it's difficult to resolve this without extremely good insurance or money to burn. The depth you get and the level of information that a good preventative care cardiologist has is just miles ahead of where your average family medicine practitioner is at. Statins are an excellent example - new prescriptions are for atorvastatin are still insanely high despite it being a fairly poor choice in comparison to rosuvastatin or pitavastatin for a good chunk of the people on it. They often are behind on the latest recommendations from the NLA and AHA, etc.There's a world where LLMs or similar can empower everyday people to talk to their doctor about their options and where they stand on health, where they don't have to hope their doc is familiar with where the science has shifted over the past 5-10 years, or cough up the money for someone who specializes in it. But that's not the world of today.In the mean time, I do think people should be comfortable being their own advocates with their doctors. I'm lucky enough that my primary care doc is open to reading the studies I send over to him on things and work with me. Or at least patient enough to humor me. But it's let me get on medications that treat my symptoms without side effects and improved my quality of life (and hopefully life/healthspan). There's also been things I've misinterpreted - I don't pick a fight with him if we come to opposite conclusions. He's shown good faith in agreeing with me where it makes sense to me, and pushed back where it hasn't, and I acknowledge he's the expert.",

          "content": "This reminds me of another recent comment in some other post, about doctors not diagnosing \"hard to diagnose\" things.There are probably (\"good\") reasons for this. But your own persistence, and today the help of AI, can potentially help you. The problem with it is the same problem as previously: \"charlatans\". Just that today the charlatan and the savior are both one and the same: The AI.I do recognize that most people probably can't tell one from the other. In both cases ;)You'll find this in my post history a few times now but essentially: I was lethargic all the time, got migraine type headaches \"randomly\" a lot. Having the feeling I'd need to puke. One time I had to stop driving as it just got so bad. I suddenly was no longer able to tolerate alcohol either.I went to multiple doctors, was sent to specialists, who all told me that they could maaaaaybe do test XYX but essentially: It wasn't a thing, I was crazy.Through a lot of online research I \"figured out\" (and that's an over-statement) that it was something about the gut microbiome. Something to do with histamine. I tried a bunch of things, like I suspected it might be DAO (Di-Amino-Oxidase) insufficiency. I tried a bunch of probiotics, both the \"heals all your stuff\" and \"you need to take a single strain or it won't work\" type stuff. Including \"just take Actimel\". Actimel gave me headaches! Turns out one of the (prominent) strains in there makes histamine. Guess what, Alcohol, especially some, has histamines and your \"hangover\" is also essentially histamines (made worse by the dehydration). And guess what else, some foods, especially some I love, contain or break down into histamines.So I figured that somehow it's all about histamines and how my current gut microbiome does not deal well with excess histamines (through whichever source). None of the doctors I went to believed this to be a \"thing\" nor did they want to do anything about it. Then I found a pro-biotic that actually helped. If you really want to check what I am taking, check the history. I'm not a marketing machine. What I do believe is that one particular bacterium helped, because it's the one thing that wasn't in any of the other ones I took: Bacillus subtilis.A soil based bacterium, which in the olden times, you'd have gotten from slightly not well enough cleaned cabbage or whatever vegetable du jour you were eating. Essentially: if your toddler stuffs his face with a handful of dirt, that's one thing they'd be getting and it's for the better! I'm saying this, because the rest of the formulation was essentially the same as the others I tried.I took three pills per day, breakfast, lunch and dinner. I felt like shit for two weeks, even getting headaches again. I stuck with it. After about two weeks I started feeling better. I think that's when my gut microbiome got \"turned around\". I was no longer lethargic and I could eat blue cheese and lasagna three days in a row with two glasses of red wine and not get a headache any longer! Those are all foods that contain or make lots of histamine. I still take one per day and I have no more issues.But you gotta get to this, somehow, through all of the bullshit people that try to sell you their \"miracle cure\" stuff. And it's just as hard as trying to suss out where the AI is bullshitting you.There was exactly a single doctor in my life, who I would consider good in that regard. I had already figured the above one out by that time but I was doing keto and it got all of my blood markers, except for cholesterol into normal again. She literally \"googled\" with me about keto a few times, did a blood test to confirm that I was in ketosis and in general was just awesome about this. She was notoriously difficult to book and later than any doctor for schedules appointments, but she took her time and even that would not really ever have been enough to suss out the stuff that I figured out through research myself if you ask me. While doctors are the \"half gods in white\", I think there's just way too much stuff and way too little time for them. It's like: All the bugs at your place of work. Now imagine you had exactly one doctor across a multitude of companies. Of course they only figure out the \"common\" ones ...",

Thirty participants wore an Apple Watch for 5-10 days to generate a VO2 max estimate. Subsequently, they underwent a maximal exercise treadmill test in accordance with the modified Åstrand protocol. The agreement between measurements from Apple Watch and indirect calorimetry was assessed using Bland-Altman analysis, mean absolute percentage error (MAPE), and mean absolute error (MAE).\n\n  Overall, Apple Watch underestimated VO2 max, with a mean difference of 6.07 mL/kg/min (95% CI 3.77–8.38). Limits of agreement indicated variability between measurement methods (lower -6.11 mL/kg/min; upper 18.26 mL/kg/min). MAPE was calculated as 13.31% (95% CI 10.01–16.61), and MAE was 6.92 mL/kg/min (95% CI 4.89–8.94).\n\n  These findings indicate that Apple Watch VO2 max estimates require further refinement prior to clinical implementation. However, further consideration of Apple Watch as an alternative to conventional VO2 max prediction from submaximal exercise is warranted, given its practical utility.\n\nhttps://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12080799/",

That’s deeply misleading.The product itself is telling you in plain English that it’s ABSOLUTELY CERTAIN about its answer… even when you challenge it and try to rebut it. And the text of the product itself is much more prominent than the little asterisk “oh no, it’s actually lying because the LLM can never be that certain.” That’s clearly not a responsible product.I opened the ChatGPT app right now and there is literally nothing about double checking results. It just says “ask anything,” in no uncertain terms, with no fine print.Here’s a recent ad from OpenAI: https://youtu.be/uZ_BMwB647A, and I quote “Using ChatGPT allowed us to really feel like we have the facts and our doctor is giving us his expertise, his experience, his gut instinct” related to a severe health question.And another recent ad related to analyzing medical scans: “What’s wonderful about ChatGPT is that it can be that cumulative source of information, so that we can make the best choices.” (https://youtu.be/rXuKh4e6gw4)And yet another recent ad, where lots of users are using ChatGPT to get authoritative answers to health questions. They even say you can take a picture of a meal before you eat and after you eat, and have it generate the amount of calories you ate! Just based on the difference between the pictures! How has that been tested and verified? (https://youtu.be/305lqu-fmbg)Now, some of the ads have users talking to their doctors, which is great.But they are clearly marketing ChatGPT as the tool to use if you want to arrive at the truth. No asterisks. No “but sometimes it’s wrong and you won’t be able to tell.” There’s nothing to misunderstand about these ads: OpenAI is telling you that ChatGPT is trustworthy.So I reject the premise that it’s the user’s fault for not using enough caution with these tools. OpenAI is practically begging you to jump in and use it for personal, life or death type decisions, and does very little to help you understand when it may be wrong.",

It’s a stateful, heavy beast that demands to be fed time and money, whether you are sending one message a day or one million.I have limited experience with Matrix, but you don't actually need Synapse (reference homeserver) which is quite a resource hog and not even remotely easy to setup/administer.You can just use the lightweight Continuwuity homeserver for the Matrix part, and Caddy for the reverse proxy/TLS/ACME part, installed on a VPS. Both require minimal configuration, and provide packages for many Linux distributions, as well as Docker images.(Continuwuity is a fork of conduwuit which was a fork of Conduit. Conduit was abandoned, but is now active again, and there are also other active forks as well. However, it seems to me that Continuwuity is currently the most active fork.)",

It might have had actual facts, but overall, my trust in Gemini's response to my query went DOWN after I noticed the AI generated video attached as the source.Countering debasement of shared reality and NOT using AI generated videos as sources should be a HUGE priority for Google.YouTube channels with AI generated videos have exploded in sheer quantity, and I think majority of the new channels and videos uploaded to YouTube might actually be AI; \"Dead internet theory,\" et al.",

One begins to suspect that the \"reductive\" method of science - the sort of physics- or mathematics-type \"reduce the variables of the problem until we can isolate effects\" approach - isn't particularly well-suited to dealing with biological systems. You see it in bioinformatics as well - we've sequenced the genomes for many organisms, and have learned a lot from doing so, but we're also learning the limits of that approach pretty strongly - the organism isn't defined just by its 'code', but its environment; the presence, distribution, and concentration of various chemicals; etc. I suspect as we move more towards the \"biological\" century here we're going to have to readjust how we approach things to start trying to find those synergistic effects earlier in the process, rather than pull everything down to its constituent parts and then experimenting pairwise with various combos. I get the difficulties in doing that, but I feel like we've repeatedly found the stuff we've discarded as irrelevant to the problem (\"things that are not in the visual wavelength the eye perceives\") in fact do wind up being relevant (wider full-spectrum light has effects outside the mere spatial perception of objects).",

The lamp used a carbon filament in an environment that prevented the evaporation of the filament.With such a lamp, one can make a tradeoff between energy efficiency and the content of healthy near infrared light, by a judicious choice of the frequency cutoff for the window through which light exits the lamp.Even with enough near-infrared light, the efficiency should be a few times higher than for classic incandescent lamps, though not as good as for LED lamps. Presumably, one could reach an efficiency similar to that of the compact fluorescent lamps (which was about half of that of LED lamps), for such an incandescent lamp that also provides near-infrared light.",

I do worry that there is some effect on our brains even though we might not perceive the flicker.As an analogy, I got into those supposedly audiophile \"Class D\" (or \"Class T\") amplifiers over a decade ago. Every day I turned on the music in my office and coded with the T-amp playing. I would have told you at the time that, indeed, it sounded amazing.Some time later I built a tube amplifier (The Darling [2], in case anyone cares—I've since built perhaps a dozen more).When I brought it into the office and swapped it out for the T-amp, the change was sublime but immediately noticeable. I hate to fall back on audiophile terminology but it's the best I have for the experience: I was suddenly aware of \"listening fatigue\" that had been a component of the T-amp. I hadn't even known it had been fatiguing until I heard the tube amp in its place for days on end.With the loss of color fidelity and the flickering issue, I'm embarrassed to say that incandescent is starting to look good to me again.I might, as an experiment, replace only those lights that we turn on in the evening when we are relaxing, reading.[1] https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Class-T_amplifier[2] https://www.diyaudio.com/community/threads/darling-1626-amp.... and https://imgur.com/gallery/oh-darling-tube-amplifier-Lq2Sx",

He‘s also a VERY good iOS and macOS engineer so he single handedly gave clawd capabilities like controlling macOS and writing iMessages.- Leaning heavily on the SOUL.md makes the agents way funnier to interact with. Early clawdbot had me laugh to tears a couple times, with its self-deprecating humor and threatening to play Nickelback on Peter‘s sound system.- Molt is using pi under the hood, which is superior to using CC SDK- Peter’s ability to multitask surpasses anything I‘ve ever seen (I know him personally), and he’s also super well connected.Check out pi BTW, it’s my daily driver and is now capable to write its own extensions.

          "content": "The only solution I can think of at the moment is a human in the loop, authorising every sensitive action. Of course it has the classic tradeoff between convenience and security, but it would work. For it to work properly, the human needs to take a minute or so reviewing the content associated with request before authorising the action.For most actions that don't have much content, this could work well as a simple phone popup where you authorise or deny.The annoying parts would be if you want the agent to reply to an email that has a full PDF or a lot of text, you'd have to review to make sure the content does not include prompt injections. I think this can be further mitigated and improved with static analysis tools specifically for this purpose.But I think it helps to think of it not as a way to prevent LLMs to be prompt injected.

          "content": "I think a major factor in the hype is that it's especially useful to the kind of people with a megaphone: bloggers, freelance journalists, people with big social media accounts, youtubers, etc. A lot of project management and IFTTT-like automation type software gets discussed out of proportion to how niche it is for the same reason. Just something to keep in mind, I don't think it's some crypto conspiracy just a mismatch between the experiences of freelance writers vs everyone else.While the popular thing when discussing the appeal of Clawdbot is to mention the lack of guardrails, personally I don't think that's very differentiating, every coding agent program has a command line flag to turn off the guardrails already and everyone knows that turning off the guardrails makes the agents extremely capable.Based on using it lightly for a couple of days on a spare PC, the actual nice thing about Clawdbot is that every agent you create is automatically set up with a workspace containing plain text files for personalization, memories, a skills folder, and whatever folders you or the agents want to add. Everything being a plain text/markdown file makes managing multiple types of agents much more intuitive than other programs I've used which are mainly designed around having a \"regular\" agent which has all your configured system prompts and skills, and then hyperspecialized \"task\" agents which are meant to have a smaller system prompt, no persistent anything, and more JSON-heavy configuration. Your setup is easy to grok (in the original sense) and changing the model backend is just one command rather than porting everything to a different CLI tool.Still, it does very much feel like using a vibe coded application and I suspect that for me, the advantages are going to be too small to put up with running a server that feels duct taped together. But I can definitely see the appeal for people who want to create tons of automations. It comes with a very good structure for multiple types of jobs (regular cron jobs, \"heartbeat\" jobs for delivering reminders and email summaries while having the context of your main assistant thread, and \"lobster\" jobs that have a framework for approval workflows), all with the capability to create and use persistent memories, and the flexibility to describe what you need and watch the agent build the perfect automation for it is something I don't think any similar local or cloud-based assistant can do without a lot of heavier customization.",

The article linked in the announcement has some more findings related to compression ratio.Also note that lightweight encodings are built into the format, and different tiles can even be encoded in a completely different way. So you have to use heuristics to find the best combination of encodings and often you need to make a trade off between tile size and decoding performance. It is still early days for MLT, but all this means there are a lot of possibilities for optimization. In fact, AWS is again financing work on MLT this year, with a focus on optimization.Lastly, when benchmarking tile size, it is good to look at actual usage patterns instead of size of the total tile set. Nobody is zooming into a random spot in the ocean, for example. ;-)",

          "content": "I’m not sure it’s very useful to rehash an argument with very tenuous relation to the OP here. The normal reason to use the Mercator projection in these situations is (a) it’s what people are used to and (b) it preserves angles so if you zoom in on a street then up will still be north and roads that are at right angles in the real world appear to be at right angles on the map. The latter property is pretty desirable and hard to achieve without doing some weird transition between projections as you zoom. This matters more for Europe (and I suppose parts of British Colombia) where there is a high population density at latitudes that are pretty extreme in much of the world.I think Apple Maps has a pretty reasonable compromise here of transitioning from a globe to Mercator as you zoom, but this is a less nice UI with a mouse as you need to click to rotate the globe instead of pointing and zooming only. I don’t think there’s anything in this data that would make that unachievable – you just need to reproject the vector data a bit as you zoom out – but it takes some tricky mathematics to get right and so hasn’t been done yet.",

They said they appreciated being able to kick the tires with Calcapp, but had now fully moved to an AI-based platform. So we're seeing this reality play out in real time.The next generation of Calcapp probably won't ship with a built-in LLM agent. Instead, it will expose all functionality via MCP (or whatever protocol replaces it in a few years). My bet is that users will bring their own agents -- agents that already have visibility into all their services and apps.I hope Calcapp has a bright future. At the same time, we're hedging by turning its formula engine into a developer-focused library and SaaS. I'm now working full-time on this new product and will do a Show HN once we're further along. It's been refreshing to work on something different after many years on an end-user-focused product.I do think there will still be a place for no-code and low-code tools. As others have noted, guardrails aren't necessarily a bad thing -- they can constrain LLMs in useful ways. I also suspect many \"citizen developers\" won't be comfortable with LLMs generating code they don't understand. With no-code and low-code, you can usually see and reason about everything the system is doing, and tweak it yourself. At least for now, that's a real advantage.",

Those things allow less technical people to understand what the agents are creating, and ask for help with more specific areas.The difficulty in the past has been 1) the amount of work it takes to build good direct manipulation tools - the level of detail you need to get to is overwhelming for most teams attempting it - but LLMs themselves make this a lot easier to build, and 2) what to do when users hit the inevitable gaps in your visual system.

That’s a weird combo, and it’s really hard to find consistently.For business logic, it’s almost the opposite. Nocode can give you a clean, visual UX—a clear map of how the logic is connected instead of a spaghetti mess in code. That value sticks around wherever “explain how this works” matters.

After years of dev, we were getting ready to launch our low code app product #2, and then bam, chatgpt 3.5 happened and LLMs stopped sucking so much.We had to look at our future for our corner of the world -- bringing our tricky gpu graph investigation tech into something that goes beyond the data 1%'ers at top gov/bank/tech/cyber investigation teams to something most teams can do -- and made the painful and expensive call to kill the low-code product.The good news is, as a verticalized startup, the market still needed something here for the same reason we originally built it. LLMs just meant the writing was on the wall that that the market expectations would grow as would what's possible in general. We correctly guessed that would happen, and started building louie.ai . Ex: While we previously had already viewed our low-code platform as doubling a way for teams to write down their investigation flows so they can eventually do ML-powered multi-turn automations on them.. we never dreamed we'd be speed running investigation capture the flag competitions. Likewise, we're now years ahead of schedule on shedding the shackles of python-first notebooks & dashboards.So yeah, for folks doing generic low-code productivity apps, it's not great. n8n and friends had to reinvent themselves as AI workflows, and there's still good reason to believe that as agent experiences improve, they'll get steamrolled anyways... but...Verticalized low-code workflow tools get to do things that are hard for the claude codes. Today the coding envs are built better than most of the non-ai-native vertical teams, but the patterns are congealing and commoditizing. It'll be interesting as the ai side continues to commoditize , and the vertical teams get better at it - at which point the verticals get much more valuable again. (And indeed, we see OpenAI and friends hitting ceilings on generic applications and having to lean in to top verticals, at least for the b2b world.)",

I think for sure, once you abstract away from the technical implementation details and use platforms which allow you to focus only on business logic, it becomes easier to move between different platforms which support similar underlying functionality. That said, some functionality may be challenging for different providers to replicate correctly... But some of the core constructs like authentication mechanisms, access controls, etc... Might be mostly interchangeable; we may end up with a few competing architectural patterns and different platforms will fit under one of the architectural patterns; which will be optimized for slightly different use cases.",

The smallest trade-off which compromises quality and future-proofing of the code is going to cost multiples the next time you (or the LLM) needs to look at it.People with industry experience know very well what happened when companies hired developers based on their ability to churn out a large volume of code. Over time, these developers start churning out more and more code, at an accelerating rate; creating an illusion of productivity from the perspective of middle-managers, but the rate of actual new feature releases grinds to a halt as the bug rate increases.With AI, it's going to be the same effect, except MUCH worse and MUCH more obvious.

In the GIS industry for example, nothing has fundamentally changed with the introduction of LLMs. They may make the same processes more efficient e.g. though automated building of workflows. AI has significantly improved classification work of course but it's still using the same principles (we've been doing ML longer than most industries). Geocoding will get cheaper and easier but it's still geocoding.GIS software allowing standard visualisation, export and map production will bet a lot better because of LLMs. It's an area where the sheer complexity and number of formats was overwhelming, but now a GeoTiff parser can be built in a day or two.The article was making a bit of a sweeping statement based on a single datapoint: they didn't need Retool anymore.",

He was perfectly fine living in Putin's Russia until 2022, when he took 250 mln from the company's budget without consulting the board of directors and left Russia (and prosecutors also found that the privatization in the 90s was illegal).

          "content": "Bayer dithering was also employed heavily on the original PlayStation. The PS1's GPU was capable of Gouraud shading with 24-bit color precision, but the limited capacity (1 MB) and bandwidth of VRAM made it preferable to use 16-bit framebuffers and textures. In an attempt to make the resulting color bands less noticeable, Sony thus added the ability to dither pixels written to the framebuffer on-the-fly using a 4x4 Bayer matrix hardcoded in the GPU [1]. On a period-accurate CRT TV using a cheap composite video cable, the picture would get blurred enough to hide away the dithering artifacts; obviously an emulator or a modern LCD TV will quickly reveal them, resulting in a distinct grainy look that is often replicated in modern \"PS1-style\" indie games.Interestingly enough, despite the GPU being completely incapable of \"true\" 24-bit rendering, Sony decided to ship the PS1 with a 24-bit video DAC and the ability to display 24-bit framebuffers regardless. This ended up being used mainly for title screens and video playback, as the PS1's hardware MJPEG decoder retained support for 24-bit output.[1]: https://psx-spx.consoledev.net/graphicsprocessingunitgpu/#24...",

I actually considered scanning the actual epaper display to show each of the dithering techniques in their intended environment as it does change the look quite a bit. From the little I know about typography and things like ink-wells I can definitely see how certain algorithms can change quite significantly. The original post here has a pattern which looks similar to old newspapers, maybe that's worth looking into?",

          "content": "> In my experience error diffusion often gets muddy due to dot gainAbsolutely - there's a reason why traditional litho printing uses a clustered dot screen (dots at a constant pitch with varying size).I've spent some time tinkering with FPGAs and been interested by the parallels between two-dimensional halftoning of graphics and the various approaches to doing audio output with a 1-bit IO pin: pulse width modulation (largely analogous to the traditional printer's dot screen) seems to cope better with imperfections in filters and asymmetries in output drivers than pulse density modulation (analogous to error diffusion dithers).",
