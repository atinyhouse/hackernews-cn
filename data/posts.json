      "content_cn": null,
      "abstract": "该讨论围绕谷歌确认将在Android系统中引入“高摩擦”侧载流程展开。核心争议在于这一政策对用户自由与安全的影响。部分用户认为侧载是安装软件的基本权利，当前流程已过于繁琐，新规可能进一步限制用户自主安装应用的能力，尤其是对自行开发未公开应用的用户构成障碍。也有用户指出，欧盟法规要求应用商店提供替代方案，若谷歌设置不合理障碍可能面临法律风险。讨论中提到，有用户因担忧政策转向更注重隐私的定制系统如GrapheneOS。同时，有观点质疑谷歌的长期战略，认为其在硬件、应用生态等方面已落后于苹果，但其他用户反驳称iOS应用优势已不明显。共识在于社区普遍反对过度限制侧载，认为应平衡安全性与用户选择权。分歧主要体现在对谷歌动机的解读及对Android与iOS生态优劣的比较上。",

          "content": "Google's long term strategy with Android is baffling to me. Apple has had better mobile hardware for years. Apple has higher consumer trust. Apple has better app selection (for most people). Apple has been increasingly implementing the core features that differentiate Android devices, like USB-C and RCS. Every Android user lost to the increasing iOS market share is another customer Google has to pay exorbitant fees to a competitor to access.And Google's strategy is to continue removing differentiating features from Android that also help them mitigate the threat of antitrust? Surely the marginal revenue from the inconsequential number of sideloading users isn't attractive enough to justify that kind of strategic blunder.",

          "content_cn": "谷歌在安卓系统上的长期战略令我感到困惑。苹果多年来一直拥有更出色的移动硬件，消费者对其信任度更高，应用选择也更丰富（对大多数人而言）。苹果正逐步引入安卓设备的核心差异化功能，比如USB-C接口和RCS协议。每流失一位安卓用户转向日益增长的iOS市场，都意味着谷歌必须向竞争对手支付高昂费用才能触达该客户。而谷歌的战略竟是继续削弱安卓的差异化功能——这些功能本有助于缓解反垄断威胁？从少数侧载用户身上获得的边际收益，显然不足以弥补这种战略失误带来的损失。"

Specifically it means installing from a non-first party sourceIt's amazing how many confidently wrong people are springing up out of the wordwork to present revisionist history about the meaning of \"install\" like it's ancient wisdom. Pre-mobile computing treated \"install\" as neutral and primary and had no built in relation to centralized distribution. Sideloading as a term of art originally, in practice came into usage for transferring media to devices, and some cloud file hosts briefly used it to mean load a file to an online drive without downloading it to computer. It's usage was varied, irregular, and not at any threshold of popular acceptance for one meaning or another.Windows, Dos, Linux, and online self-hosted services had no notion of \"sideloading\", or at least no usage of that vocabulary and did not use this notion of \"install\" that is now being retrospectively declared a longstanding historical norm. Even now, that's not a term used in Windows or Linux. Even Apple, who very much in practice utilize this controlled distribution model but even they don't use this sideloading/installing verbal distinction. In Apple's lexicon installing is neutral with respect to where an app comes from.So it's staggering to see a specific term of art that deviates from historical precedent that only is used in an Android context and only relatively recently in the history of computing be referred to as if its observing a longstanding precedent across all of computing.

Both to avoid upsetting people in power and out of their owners' naïve beliefs.Reading them was like living in an alternate reality where nothing more notable happens than a release of new version X of a framework Y. Large portions of the tech community had exactly the same attitude that could be seen here and now - refusal to consider the societal implications of their daily work, adherence to technical solutions over the real world ones (\"I'll just work remotely and use a VPN, who cares\") and just simple willful ignorance.It was around that time that I started to frequent English speaking discussions, which were much more vibrant and open.

Your car becoming worthless after a decade suits them down to the ground.Battery swapping changes the game entirely. Imagine a national network of exchange stations (co-located with existing petrol infrastructure, you can use the overhead canopy for solar). Standard pack sizes scaled by vehicle class: compact cars get 2 cells, vans get 4, lorries get 8.Whoever owns these battery packs now has skin in the game for longevity. Their profit depends on keeping packs in service for 20+ years, not selling you a new car.Suddenly the R&D money flows towards batteries that last, obsolescence now costs them money, and isn’t a happy accident that keeps you hooked on buying more cars.You’d still have the option to buy your own packs outright if you only ever charge at home, but the network creates the economic pressure for genuine improvement of longevity in battery tech that’s completely missing today.I’m aware that a company called “Better Place” failed. But they were a startup trying to strong-arm the automotive industry. A nationally coordinated infrastructure concern is different, and the air quality data from this study suggests we can’t afford to keep muddling through - and I really think that peoples concerns about batteries are not misplaced.Perfect is the enemy of good, but damned if we can’t at least align incentives for better.",

And I said, no that's a Mazda 3 hatchback... 6-speed manual. Lovely vehicle to drive. Economical, but luxurious for the price. Very practical, too.But... if you asked me if I'd go from the Polestar 2 back to the Mazda 3? I'd say no. I'll keep the electric. Of course it's not a fair comparison... one had an MSRP of $27k and the other $67k. One has 186HP and the other 476HP (and all-wheel drive).One had a lot of routine maintenance of the engine, while the other has needed wiper blades and tires. And one requires standing outside in 10° F days like today pumping gas, while the other one is charging in my garage (and warms up the cabin from the press of a button on my phone.)The Mazda 3 was more of a driver's car, and if I had bought either new, it would be a very different equation. (I bought the 3 w/ 8K miles on it for $20k; I bought the Polestar w/ 20K miles on it for $29K.) The Mazda 3 has a vastly better interface - better auto-dimming headlights, tons of buttons for climate, stereo, etc.But the Polestar 2 is the one I would rather be driving... for now.

These are the opposite of luxury cars. There are a quite a few new more joining the half dozen or so that were for sale last year. The trend here is that EVs are becoming the cheapest option.A few cars from Stellantis that are available in ICE and EV variants are now actually cheaper in the EV variant. This reflects the reality that batteries are now cheap and EVs don't have a lot of moving parts. So, they should be easier and cheaper to assemble. That's a trend that is spreading across all price segments in the next few years. Driven by component and cheap battery availability.Used EVs are widely available now as well. You can get some amazing deals on cars that mostly still have their drive trains + batteries under warranty. Lots of cars coming out of lease programs are sold on second hand. EVs have been very popular for car leasing for the last 6-7 years now. These are mostly still the relatively expensive models from a few years ago.The cheap EVs that are now on the market will inevitably start penetrating the second hand market in larger and larger numbers. Cheap ICE cars are disappearing rapidly from the market as models are being discontinued by manufacturers and as the market shares for ICE vehicles keep on shrinking. That means they'll also start getting more scarce in the second hand market in a few years. You'll still be able to get your Ford Fiesta. But it will be a model from before it was discontinued a few years ago. Or the new electric model that they are rumored to launch soonish.",

          "content": "It is a horrible setup that the manufacturers would much rather sell you a new car than a new battery.We saw this play out with phones. We used to have easily swappable batteries. And since battery chemistry was (and hopefully still is and will continue) improving, by the time you actually swapped the battery there were ones around with a higher capacity than the battery the phone shipped with. And typically for little money.Now everything is glued and messy to swap so the manufacturer can sell you a battery swap for much much more money than it used to cost.I believe cars should have swappable somewhat standardized batteries. Even if not swappable by the user, it should not be a more than 1h job at the mechanic (ANY mechanic, not just the manufacturer).Imagine picking a car and not caring about battery at all. You want a Tesla but BYD batteries are better - so get a Tesla without a Battery and put a BYD one it it. Or maybe Tesla has the best batteries right now, so you get that. And once you have to swap the battery, you again just pick the best manufacturer at the time - who might not even be a car manufacturer at all but rather someone specialized in batteries exclusively.And since hopefully 10 years have passed since you bought the last battery, chemistry has improved so you pick from options that are all (hopefully a lot) better than the battery you had initially.We could have some proper competition where manufacturers would have to compete on pricing and performance.But car manufacturers don't care. They want as much of your money as they can get. And opening their cars to third party batteries and not keeping up as many walls as they can is the opposite of that.So until forced by regulation every manufacturer will continue to put batteries in their cars that only they themselves will sell and put a slightly different one in every car. So guess what, even if you swap your battery in 10 years, they will sell you the same battery you can buy right now. Because the newer stuff is for new cars only and compatible with your car.",

The axle weight is 20 000, so by the 4th power law the damage is proportional to 2 x 20 000^4 = 3.2 x 10^17.If instead those 80 passengers each drove alone in a Kia Niro EV it would be about 4 000 pounds each, so an axle weight of 2000, so the damage would be proportional to 160 x 2000^4 = 2.56 x 10^15.That's 125 times less road damage than the bus!Another interesting 4th power calculation is EV vs ICE. My car is available as an ICE, a hybrid, or an EV. I've got the EV which weighs more than the ICE.Based on the 4th power law I should be doing about 40% more damage than I would if I had bought the lighter ICE model.But wait! With the ICE model I'd need to regularly by gasoline, and that gasoline is delivered by a tanker truck. Tanker trucks, especially when they are traveling between wherever they load and wherever they unload, are very heavy.I calculated what would happen in a hypothetical city where everyone drove the ICE version and then all switched to the EV version, and how many tanker truck gas deliveries that would eliminate. I don't remember the exact numbers but it was something like if mid sized tankers were used for gas delivery then if they had to drive more than a few miles from wherever they loaded up to wherever they unloaded the elimination of those trips by everyone switching to EV would reduce road damage by more than the damage caused by the EVs being heavier than the ICE cars.",

But digging deeper, it quickly became clear that they didn't understand how to run my software correctly; and in many other places they bent over backwards to cherry-pick, and made a lot of bold and completely wrong claims.  Correcting the record would place their software far below mine.Mind you, I'm VERY happy to see newer toolkits which are better than mine -- I wrote this thing over 20 years ago after all, and have since moved on.  But several colleagues demanded I do so.  After a lot of back-and-forth however, it became clear that the journal's editor was too embarrassed and didn't want to require a retraction or revision.

It turned out most of them were bogus in some obvious way. A lot of ideas for science reform take as axiomatic that the bad stuff is rare and just needs to be filtered out. Once you engage with some field's literatures in a systematic way, it becomes clear that it's more like searching for diamonds in the rough than filtering out occasional corruption.But at that point you wonder, why bother?

Applied empirically to people, it has predictive power and can eliminate surprise because the actions of bad people are correlated with bad actions in many different ways. A bad person does something very stupid today, very irresponsible tomorrow, and will unsurprisingly continue to do bad things of all sorts of kinds even if they stay clear of some kinds.",

          "content": "Small tangent, but I feel like it is a good time to drop the term \"net neutrality\", which covers way too much ground. In the past in political discussions, the term \"violation of net neutrality\" was used to protest multiple different issues:* Traffic shaping (e.g. slowing down Bittorrent traffic)* Traffic fast lanes (pay for priority access to some content providers)* Selective zero-rating (exclude some providers from counting towards a traffic limit)* Artificial peering restriction (what Telekom is doing, usually via forcing content providers into paid peering agreements)I think people should start using more specific terms that are understandable for non-technical people, because otherwise the discussion becomes confused, which helps the providers.Lots of semi-technical people think that \"violating net neutrality\" refers to traffic fast lanes, because the last time this discussion entered the public was when the US social media was in uproar about FCC rules 10 years ago.What Telekom is doing looks similar to the outside (some content providers are fast, some are not), but they can just deflect by saying that they do not intentionally throttle traffic, which is pretty much true, as they hit their physical bottlenecks. If you are knowledgable enough as a lawmaker to press them on the peering issue, they could argue that forcing peering would force them to pay rent at Internet Exchanges, just so other providers have good access. Where they also kind of have a point.And even lots of technical people have no clue about peering, transit etc. and treat their uplink as a blackbox, a cloud in their network chart where the Internet comes out.For the Telekom case, we would need a different legislation, for example make paid peering agreements between providers illegal or at least regulated, which would then be an incentive to be generally well-connected (free mutual peering is usually considered a win-win scenario unless you are Deutsche Telekom and can use your market power to bully other market participants into another form of rent extraction). And that means that lawmakers and the public need to understand first the specific problem we are fighting.",

If they think that routing everything via EU is cheaper instead of just peering better in the other parts of the world to deliver traffic locally, then be it, that is their own economic freedom to decide so.But they will realistically not do that. Also, SDNs will likely never go back to serving content in Europe from e.g. the US. Good connectivity is just generally the economically better option.That being said, T1 companies like Deutsche Telekom who also serve a large consumer base via broadband and mobile and not just other large business networks are probably more vulnerable to such legislation than an exclusive transit provider.",

These properties hold for SFP modules too in general, not just SFP ONTs (they're all computers with persistence).The catch is that this is further true for all of these kinds of modems.The counter-catch is that despite that, for DSL specifically, you could absolutely bring your own modem, hw and sw both.The counter-counter-catch is that with DSL, you were not connecting to a shared media, but point-to-point.

These need to handle encryption and be able to properly register on the tree, so I'm not completely shocked they require some form of ISP-provided device to terminate the fiber connection.There's also a EU law which says that users should be able to bring their own modems / routers, so AFAIK providers say that this particular terminal device is still \"on their side of the network\".I've seen such devices come in two varieties.One is a separate device which plugs on the optical network, does the encryption and stuff, and then exposes an ethernet port which is connected to the actual router which does wifi, etc. With SFR and Bouygues, it was trivial [0] to replace the ISP-provided router with one of your choosing. You get the normal external IPs and you do your thing. The ISP router sleeps in its box in storage. This was my setup up until a few years ago, with both these providers. Now SFR has moved to CGNAT, but the setup is the same, so I expect users to still be able to switch routers (but I haven't tested, since I'm not a client anymore).Then there's Free, who provides a single device that connects to the fiber, does routing, wifi, etc. In this case, it's possible to flip a switch in its settings for it to act as a bridge (don't know how wifi behaves in this case, if it stays on). It then only accepts a single downstream client, which gets the external IP. SFR had a similar setup for DOCSIS.I'm not familiar with how Orange, the biggest operator, functions. But I understand they have a general tendency to be a PITA so YMMV with them.---[0] For Bouygues, this device only talked on a tagged VLAN100 for some reason. On the SFR, the network expected you to send a client id in the DHCP request.",

I create helper files and then have a devops chat, a front end chat, an architecture chat and a security chat, and once each it done it's work it automatically writes to a log and the others pick up the log (it seems to have a system reminder process build in that can push updates from other chats into other chats.

Further, the next agent can just be told the outcome, it also has reduced context load, because it doesn't need to do the inner workings, just know what the result is.For instance, a security testing agent just needs to review code against a set of security rules, and then list the problems. The next agent then just gets a list of problems to fix, without needing a full history of working it out.",

This workflow allows for more effective independent work without context management issues (if you have subagents, there is also an issue with how the progress of the task is communicated by introducing things like task board, it is possible to manage this state outside of context). The flow is quite complex and requires a lot of additional context that isn't required with chat-based flow, but is a much better way to do things.The way to think about this pattern - one which many people began concurrently building in the past few months - is an AI which manages other AIs.",

Human writers avoid repeating the same phrases in quick succession, even across different writings (e.g. I might not reuse some phrase in email to person A, because I just used it in email to unrelated person B, and it feels like bad style).Perhaps that's why reading LLM output feels like reading high school essays.

It's sort of like what the makers of Basecamp, in their book Getting Real, say in chapter 7, \"Fix Time and Budget, Flex Scope\"<https://basecamp.com/gettingreal/02.4-fix-time-and-budget-fl...>.I wonder if it was a mistake to ever call it \"engineering\", because that leads people to think that software engineering is akin to mechanical or civil engineering, where you hire one expensive architect to do the design, and then hand off the grunt work to lower-paid programmers to bang out the code in a repetitive and predictable timeline with no more hard thinking needed. I think that Jack Reeves was right when he said, in 1992, that every line of code is architecture. The grunt work of building it afterward is the job of the compiler and linker. Therefore every time you write code, you are still working on the blueprint. \"What is Software Design?\"<https://www.bleading-edge.com/Publications/C++Journal/Cpjour...>Martin Fowler cites this in his 2005 essay about agile programming, \"The New Methodology\"<https://www.martinfowler.com/articles/newMethodology.html>. Jeff Atwood, also in 2005, explains why software is so different from engineering physical objects, because the laws of physics constrain houses and bridges and aircraft. \"Bridges, Software Engineering, and God\"<https://blog.codinghorror.com/bridges-software-engineering-a...>. All this explains not only why estimates are so hard but also why two programs can do the same thing but one is a thousand lines of code and one is a million.I came into programming from a liberal arts background, specifically writing, not science or math. I see a lot of similarities between programming and writing. Both let you say the same thing an infinite number of ways. I think I benefitted more from Strunk and White's advice to \"omit needless words\" than I might have from a course in how to build city hall.",

If you are building a feature that’s similar to something you built before, then it’s very possible to give accurate estimates to, say, p80 or p90 granularity.You just need to recognize that there is always some possibility of uncovering a bug or dependency issue or infra problem that delays you, and this uncertainty compounds over longer time horizon.The author even gestures in this direction:> sometimes you can accurately estimate software work, when that work is very well-understood and very small in scope. For instance, if I know it takes half an hour to deploy a serviceSo really what we should take from this is that the author is capable of estimating hours-long tasks reliably. theptip reports being able to reliably estimate weeks-long tasks. And theptip has worked with rare engineers who can somehow, magically, deliver an Eng-year of effort across multiple team members within 10% of budget.So rather than claim it’s impossible, perhaps a better claim is that it’s a very hard skill, and pretty rare?(IMO also it requires quite a lot of time investment, and that’s not always valuable, eg startups usually aren’t willing to implement the heavyweight process/rituals required to be accurate.)",

Engineers love to push back on estimates, believing that \"when it's done\" is somehow acceptable for the rest of the business to function. In a functioning org, there are lot of professionals depending on correct estimation to do their job.For us, an accurate delivery date on a 6 month project was mandatory. CX needed it so they could start onboarding high priority customers. Marketing needed it so they could plan advertising collateral and make promises at conventions. Product needed it to understand what the Q3 roadmap should contain. Sales needed it to close deals. I was fortunate to work in a business where I respected the heads of these departments, which believe it or not, should be the norm.The challenge wasn't estimation - it's quite doable to break a large project down into a series of sprints (basically a sprint / waterfall hybrid). Delays usually came from unexpected sources, like reacting to a must have interruption or critical bugs. Those you cannot estimate for, but you can collaborate on a solution. Trim features, push date, bring in extra help, or crunch. Whatever the decision, making sure to work with the other departments as colaborators was always beneficial.",

Someone else says \"40 points\" and they're asked to explain and it turns out they misunderstood the feature entirely. After somewhere from 2 to 20 minutes, everyone has tried to think about all the gotchas and all the ways it might be done more easily, and you come up with an estimate. History tells you how many points you usually deliver per sprint, and after a few months the team usually gets pretty accurate to within +/- 10% or so, since underestimation on one story gets balanced by overestimation on another.It's not magic. It prevents you from estimating things longer than a sprint, because it assumes that's impossible. But it does ensure that you're constantly delivering value at a steady pace, and that you revisit the cost/benefit tradeoff of each new piece of work at every sprint, so you're not blindsided by everything being 10x or 20x slower than expected after 3 or 6 months.",

It got to the point in an org I worked for once that the VP had to explicitly put a moratorium on engineers giving estimates because those estimates were being taken by non-technical stakeholders of various stripes and put into decks where they were remixed and rehashed and used as fodder for resourcing tradeoff discussions at the VP and executive level in such a way as to be completely nonsensical and useless.  Of course these tradeoff discussions were important, but the way to have them was not to go to some hapless engineer, pull an overly precise estimate based on a bunch of tacit assumptions that would never bear out in reality, and then hoist that information up 4 levels of management to be shown to leadership with a completely different set of assumptions and context.  Garbage in, garbage out.These days I think of engineering level of effort as something that is encapsulated as primarily an internal discussion for engineering.  Outwardly the discussion should primarily be about scope and deadlines.  Of course deadlines have their own pitfalls and nuance, but there is no better reality check for every stakeholder—a deadline is an unambiguous constraint that is hard to misinterpret.  Sometimes engineers complain about arbitrary deadlines, and there are legitimate complaints if they are passed down without any due diligence or at least a credible gut check from competent folks, but on balance I think a deadline helps engineering more than it hurts as it allows us to demand product decisions, designs, and other dependencies land in a timely fashion.  It also prevents over-engineering and second system syndrome, which is just as dangerous a form of scope creep as anything product managers cook up when the time horizon is long and there is no sense of urgency to ship.",

          "content": "> What often baffles me with engineers and especially engineering managers is that they don't derive the estimates from metrics of prior projects, especially for long running teams (as opposed to project teams).The PMI project management methodology even pre-scribes this (after the project is over, to reflect, and then to gather collected learnings and objective stats so as to help better estimation of future projects), but the problem is many engineers see project management a administrative burden rather than as a tool, and they have a tinkerer's mind-set rather than a scientist's mind-set.Good project management practice is also not to use\npoint estimates but intervals: something is going to take \"betweek [i;j] person days\". PERT-estimates are even three-point estimates of work (best case, expected case, worst case), so you model the uncertainty explicitly rather than by some alchemist formula (\"double and add 20%\").Incidentally, I found out empirically that the best technical people tend to be the worst at estimating their own time needed to complete a task. That's because the best are often also a bit over-confident, perhaps. Letting each team member estimate a task and adding a 20% correction for unforseen issues has worked well to make my projects be delivered on time.Tip: Push back if management tells you how long you have; either explain to them what you can give to them in the time they dictate or reject their task order and say you will come back when you have calculated how long the project takes, which can only be rationally determined once the scope is clear(er).Check out/google: PMI PMP methodology and also PMBOK (project management body of knowledge) > \"Organizational Process Assets\" (OPAs) > \"Lessons Learned Repository\"",

This is intentional, so that estimation is about the team, not any person.And yes, when there's a task that one person happens to know most, people will often defer to them. But that in itself is educational, as the experienced dev explains why the given task is easy/hard. And every task is different, so the person you're deferring to will be different, and you still often get the two or three people who know the task best disagreeing until they hash it out, etc. And very often it's another person who can point out \"well it would be that easy except three sprints ago I did x and so you'll now need to do y...\". And of course plenty of tasks really are brand-new so everyone's figuring it out together.If you're really not having actual discussions around complexity in planning poker, then the facilitator/lead/manager might be doing it wrong. You do have to create an environment where people are expected to speak up and disagree, to demonstrate that this is welcomed and expected and rewarded, and not just some kind of checkbox exercise where the most senior dev gives their estimation and everyone agrees.

After a quick analysis I adjusted this to 14 weeks.But the account manager thought this sounded too long and insisted that we plug everything in to a Gantt chart, define the shit out of everything, map the dependencies, etc, which showed that the development would only take 6 weeks.The project ended up taking 14 weeks.",

          "content": "In another life, I would do things like measure the cost in developer time of bugs making it into developer repos vs. the cost in time of running tests in CI to catch such bugs, so evidence based decision making.  It was mostly ignored, and at first I was surprised.  A multi million dollar organization of people making negative EV plays, which I chalked up to the political pressures being more important than the wastage.  More on that later.As far as estimates go, I've also struggled with the industries cult(ural) rituals.  I tried to put forward a Gaussian based approach that took into account not only the estimate of time, but the expected uncertainty, which is still probably off the mark, but at least attempts to measure some of the variance.  But again, the politics and the rigidity of the clergy that has built around software development blocked it.On the bright side, all this has helped me in my own development and when I think about software development and estimating projects.  I know that outcomes become more chaotic as the number of pieces and steps compound in a project (i.e. the projects normal curve widens).  You may not even get the project at all as defined at the outset, so my normals approach is still not quite the right tool.I think this kind of thinking can be helpful when working solo or in a small group who are exposed to market forces.  But for solo and small groups, the challenge isn't so much about the estimates, it's about how you're going to fight a battalion of mercenaries hired by big VC money and Big Tech.  They can often afford to be inefficient, dump in the market, because their strategy is built around market control.  These aren't practices small players can afford, so you need to get creative, and try to avoid these market participant kill boxes.  And this is why, coming back to my earlier point, that often times, inefficient practices and politics plays a big role.  Their trying to marshal a large number of troops into position and can afford to lose a few battles in order to win the war.  The big money plays by a different set of rules, so don't worry if their doing it wrong.  Just recognize your in the army soldier!",

Now, that pair must meet much stricter criteria to be suitable, such as Category 5 (for 100Mbit) or Category 5e (1000Mbit ie Gigabit) - but it really is just twisted pair cable, merely a tighter specification than your phone.Suppose you are a sparky (electrician) and you have some jobs where you are to install telephone connections, some where you put in \"Ethernet\" (presumably 100baseT would be fine) and some they specifically want you to wire for Gigabit.You could go to your wholesaler and buy a reel of Cat3 phone cable, a reel of Cat5 100baseT Ethernet, and a third reel of Cat 5e Gigabit cable, and take the right one for each job. So long as you do this flawlessly you can probably save a few pounds every year by using a slightly cheaper cable for some jobs.Or, you can buy one reel of Cat5e and use that for all these jobs and since it's the same reel you can't have the wrong one and don't need to check paperwork to know you've put the correct cable in a duct etc. Thought that was a phone line but now the client insists it's data? No problem, they're the exact same cable, just smile and agree.When I bought the place where I live now I wanted GigE to this desk, even though the DSL comes into a different room. I didn't love the idea of cutting holes in walls but I was resigned to maybe needing that, except there's a phone extension in this room (like the author says, we do love phone extensions) and so that room the DSL comes into has a twisted pair to here. I opened up the box, and I'm like huh, that's Cat5e, and sure enough this entire building was wired with Cat5e because like I said, why not, it's basically the same cable, why carry a separate reel?So I changed the face plates from telephone to Ethernet, and I'm done.",

It can do 1gbps with a RJ45 connection, just replace the plug and connect tou your device to check, yo ucan get a cheap ethernet cable tester too. If it has just 3 pairs, it can probably do 100mbs automatically with most ethernet capable devices.\n- If you just need to connect 2 devices, you may probably just use existing cables to do it. More than 2 devices would not work.\n- If it doesn't work, all those cables probably go to a box, find it and check if they are connected, if not yo ucan just crimp the ends together.Other alternatives:\n- As others mentioned, MoCA devices are also able to deliver 1gbps, and there is a higher chance that you may find them in most rooms, and they are almost always connected, so it shoudl be plug&play.\n- Powerline adapters novadays not too bad as well. I was able to use them in a 30 eyar old home, 3 floors up to provide 500mbs.",

It is still one of my most read blog posts and I get emails from it still, because apparently even in 2025 actually hooking up a USB-C ethernet adapter will cause quite a few switches to fail.Long winded way of saying: our Ethernet does Gigabit because I never upgraded and has almost no devices left.

I'm probably a customer for that.I'm currently running MoCA over spliced coax as part of the local connection and not amused by the 5ms latency on it. Also running 100mbit over cat3 I found in a wall which does work, but cat3 in another wall can't hold 10mbit. That link actually can hold 70mbit of vdsl but after a nearby lightning strike slagged various hardware I've moved the vdsl modem back to the BT wires entry point and run the output through some fibre.And there's a wifi bridge between two other points. And some ethernet running outside the building. Previously also ethernet-over-mains that I might bring back now that I've learned what spanning tree protocols are so the periodic reboots they inexplicably require can be tolerated transparently.Also the connection to the internet itself is crap so bonding vdsl, starlink and 5g through the openmptcprouter project. Just lots of redundancy and self healing hacks all over the place to give an observably solid connection.Which is a rambling way to say that if you're in Britain and your network connection brings you sorrow, it can be forced to be acceptable with application of more time and money than other countries require.",

I was fitting switches which were state of the art at the time (IPv6 experiments), and they didn't have a 100Mbit option because that was legacy, so you'd plug this ancient looking 1980s cable designed for 10baseT into a switch, and in most cases once it's connected the switch and the network card at the far end both go \"Aha link, can I do 1000baseT over this?\" and conclude yeah, Gigabit just works.

Its a lot of heavy equipment and a lot of dudes to operate it all.The good news is if they're already down the road they'll come by and bore for like $20/foot because its a small job (usually they only charge $10/foot for long runs)Permitting depends a lot on where you live, some places treat it as a cash cow and they will brutally milk you, others don't require a permit at all.  The equipment takes up a fair amount of space on each side, probably more than you'd expect.  Scheduling is like dealing with an arborist.  \"OMG I need this partially collapsed tree removed immediately its an emergency I have homeowners insurance please arrive in the next hour\" well thats multiple kilobucks \"Meh please remove this tree sometime and I don't care when\" well thats like $250, probably less if cash.I've seen people spend thousands of dollars on DB or crazy laser/wireless comm gear to avoid spending hundreds of dollars on a stone mason.  Try not to pay someone to DB under a stone wall, its usually cheaper to hire a stone mason twice and he will leave the wall in better condition than before you started.  All masonry is temporary unless its maintained.  Similar logic might apply to driveways, most concrete cracks so if you're hiring a guy to fix the crack you may want to bury a conduit before he fixes it.  Replacing an entire driveway is expensive, replacing a sidewalk sized path is surprisingly cheap.  If you want sidewalk poured (like for a walkway in your garden or around a swimming pool) its about $50/foot and a driveway would have to be thicker and better prepped, but the section could be narrower than a sidewalk.  The point being don't accept a DB bid over $50/ft because its cheaper to replace the concrete at $50/ft.",

Must be nice to open up a wall jack and be pleasantly surprised instead of bitterly disappointed :-).I recently built a vacation property and could choose what to install. Initially, I was thinking CAT6A but after getting some good quality plenum-rated 6A to play with, I discovered it's surprisingly thick and doesn't bend very easily (minimum corner radii to avoid shield damage are actually specced) and it's not exactly easy to DIY new connectors on them correctly if you don't do it all the time.So, after really considering the max throughput I'm ever likely to actually use, I decided to go with some good CAT6. It wasn't even a cost thing, as the difference was negligible. It was just practical reality. None of the runs are very long and I should be able to get up to 10gbps on 6A, although I doubt I'll ever use more than 2.5gbps (only using 1gbps today). One factor is the property is off-grid except for AC, so data is via StarLink anyway and fiber won't ever happen out there. While LEO satellite and terrestrial cellular speeds will increase in coming years, when more than 2.5gpbs is available - it'll almost certainly be priced to maximize B2B profit and we probably wouldn't pay that for a vacation house (because this is the US, not someplace that prices broadband rationally like Korea).",

You could end up in a situation where they go for gigabit and it doesn't work well.Fortunately, the main issue for signal transmission is loss over distance. Ethernet is designed to work over 100m every time in a noisy industrial environment. You've got a pretty good chance for it to work on a short run, even with poor cables.The alternatives being discussed ADSL/VDSL/G.hn actually detect the capability of the medium and adjust the transmission rates and frequency to give the maximum possible speed. IMO they are much more advanced technologically and much more interesting.

Claude would watch a folder for screen shots, read it in, and if it detected bad posture, write to a file the program was watching to adjust blur.I did this weird work-around so I could use my Claude Code subscription as opposed to the API.Anyways, it was too slow and Claude was a bad judge of slouchiness.

If we don't blow an eFuse, then those security updates can just be undone, since any random enemy with hardware access could plug in a USB cable, flash the older exploitable signed firmware, steal your personal data, install a trojan, etc. I get the appeal of ROMs/jailbreaking/piracy but it relies on running obsolete exploitable firmware.

The article is in Spanish; here are some of the main points, translated into English:1. According to the CIAF, the break in the track was \"practically undetectable.\" The fracture on the track was not noticed by the trains that passed over it, or by the technicians responsible for the maintenance of the infrastructure.2. The damaged train, which belongs to the Italian company Iryo, is heavier than other trains running on the track; the additional weight of the Iryo train may have been a factor, or possibly even one of the causes, of the derailment.3. The CIAF said that the notches registered in the wheels and the deformation in the rail are \"compatible\" with the fact that the track was broken before the Iryo train passed over it.4. Spanish Transportation Minister Óscar Puente rejected criticism of the delay of the rescuers; according to the Minister, rescuers arrived within \"18 minutes.\"The full article is available here: https://www.jornada.com.mx/2026/01/24/mundo/020n3mun",

CIAF表示，车轮上记录的凹痕和铁轨的变形与伊里奥列车通过前轨道已断裂的事实\"相符\"。\n4. 西班牙交通部长奥斯卡·普恩特驳斥了对救援人员延误的批评；据部长称，救援人员在\"18分钟内\"抵达现场。\n全文可在此处查看：https://www.jornada.com.mx/2026/01/24/mundo/020n3mun"

And if the track is laid on a concrete slab rather than ballast, it isn't moving anywhere.Fun fact: the reason modern concrete or composite sleepers (e.g. [1]) have a slightly concave profile is to better resist lateral forces (i.e. buckling) than traditional straight-profile wooden sleepers.[1] https://www.romicgroup.com/permanent-way/concrete-railway-sl...",

Or oft-repeated elsewhere) about how he had to come to terms with the purpose of writing not being to show off how smart you are to the reader. Instead your writing has to evince some kind of innate investment to the reader that piques their genuine interests and intrigue.A lot of writers are tainted by the expectations set in grade school. Write for a grade and good writing is what yields a good grade according to the standards set by the subject which often is not ‘Composition’ but more like ‘Prove to me that you remember everything we mentioned in class about the French Revolution’.I’ve never felt drawn into an article by Gwern at least not in the way that I have been by some writing by Maciej Cegłowski, for example. Reading Gwern I am both overwhelmed by the adornments to the text (hyperlinks, pop-ups, margin notes; other hypertext doodads and portals) and underwhelmed by the substance of the text itself. I don’t consider Paul Graham a literary griot either. But I find that his own prose is bolstered by a kind of clarity and asceticism that is informative and not entirely void of good style and form.Lawrence McEnery of the University of the Chicago contributed a lot of good thinking to this kind of stuff though.This wasn’t meant to be a criticism of the author of this post’s own work. But here that’s how it’s left. I haven’t come across any writing of his that’s as intriguing as \"Empires Without Farms: The Case of Venice” seems. If anyone has any recommendations, do share.",

Yes, attention hacking is important in this case.There is also a writing where people are looking for the information, and they are showing up at your door because they already care. Presumably you wrote, because you saw the open question, and want to try answering it. History books, encyclopedias, classic literature by dead people, falls under this.

Or oft-repeated elsewhere) about how he had to come to terms with the purpose of writing not being to show off how smart you are to the reader.He expands on this in his conversation with Bryan Garner (of Garner's Modern English Grammar) published as Quack this Way, and I think he gets to the core issue, which is that your ideas are not interesting to anyone but you; if you are showing off how smart you are, you are assuming the reader will find your ideas as important and interesting as you do. It is the writer's job to show the reader why they should be interested, why they should care.Infinite Jest is a also a good example of something which goes against TFA's point, it opens with a very sterile, impersonal, literal and completely disconnected first person narrative, he gives us nothing to care about. But it evolves, but he still doesn't give us anything to care about, just has the narration turn in on itself despite it seeming to have nothing to turn in onto. All he really gives us is the suggestion that there is something more than what we can see. He gets us interested and curious but I don't think we really care at that point.",

Rather, I am attempting to explain things to my future self, who is intelligent and interested, but has forgotten. What I am doing is explaining why I decided what I did to myself and noting down everything I found interesting about it for future reference. I hope my other readers, whomever they may be, might find the topic as interesting as I found it, and the essay useful or at least entertaining–but the intended audience is my future self.— <https://gwern.net/about#target-audience>We can reconcile this with the purport of the writing of his that we’re discussing now—it’s a notice with his future self in mind. And we can compare and contrast the above quote and the aforementioned piece with some of PG’s writing which I find is meant to be public-facing literature at full bloom. [1][2]I think there’s a difference between 'writing for my future self’ and ‘writing with the public in mind’. Howard & Barton (1986) would argue that they represent separate stages of the writing process and I agree with that and prefer writing that is primed for the latter form. [3] I associate the maxim “First, make me care” with the latter as well and by-and-large feel like Gwern’s writing—that which I’ve come across most frequently—is geared toward the former form. Which I’m sure serves him well, as well as I’m sure it’s served well to those who enjoy his work. I’m yet to determine whether that’s a good or bad thing.As I’ve cited earlier, some consider Gwern's writing to evoke a sort of misanthropy.

          "content": "I like where you’re heading with this and to a degree I think that it leads toward considerations about the personality of the author in tow with their writing and writing ability which on its head evokes questions about what makes a person, well, personable. Which turns this into a sensitive discussion about what one can glean about an author’s character traits based on their writing style and when the author in question is only a ‘public figure’ in the eyes of the niche collection of online enclaves who are even aware that Gwern exists it becomes tough to candidly critique his literary persona with the sort of freedom that one may have when talking about say, some guy who’s written for the Atlantic for 30 years and is further from the spaces where criticisms about his work are held.My criticisms about Gwern’s writing is not meant to be taken...ahem...personally in the sense that I don’t want to use Gwern as a subject for whatever literary critique I’m trying to proffer beyond how useful it is—and is presenting itself—as a fine case to help make whatever point I’m trying to make more clear about how Writing style is inextricable from and indicative of personality or lack thereof. And this is probably a part of what makes reading and writing such a profound experience.One of the most interesting remarks about Gwern’s writing is this comment [1]:> Everything I read from gwern has this misanthropic undertones. It's hard to put a finger on it exactly, but it grits me when I try reading him.— <https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42135302>While I can't agree with the entirety of `mola’s comment—I simply haven’t put that much thought into making as grave of an evaluation into Gwern’s character as such a judgement would demand, nor am I that interested in deliberating over such an evaluation—it still resonates with me as a reader and you’ll find in my comment downthread from `mola’s remark that it’s at least plausible that an affinity for self-expression and intellectualizing about the world doesn’t necessitate an interest in the rest of its inhabitants in a way that causes me not to find the thesis behind “First, make me care” to be coloured with a stroke of irony, considering who’s behind it.You say \"style is more important when you want to reach someone who hasn't heard of you.” I agree with that and I reckon that it’s still style that forms a non-trivial amount of how you identify with ‘who’ the author is once you’ve become familiar with they’re work and can set an expectation for why their ideas may be worthwhile to engage with in the first place. Again, Paul Graham’s writing has a style although no where to the degree that Maciej Cegłowski does. You can evince characteristics about each of them relative to how and what they write about. You can even speculate on ways that their respective personalities could lead to friction between them. [2]When we interrogate the “who” behind “who wrote” we are making judgements about the personality of the author and how that that makes us interested in their ideas. Today there are various non-literary mediums that give us a glimpse at a person’s personality with which we can anticipate whether it’s worth reading what they write. But if all you go by is their writing then how they write is about the only way for you to speculate about 'who' the author is and what they’re like as a person.There are probably holes in this line of reasoning but I don’t think the lines between writing style, personal appeal and the ability to appeal to readers through how you write—effectively signaling to your personality in the process!—are as distinct as I think you’re portraying them. What’s the opposite of orthogonal? Correlated?To end: Gwern’s writing lacks personality to me. This makes it hard to reconcile with the point he’s making in this article (which I agree with!) and my perception of his own writing (which invariably and perhaps even unfortunately invites speculation into any writer’s own personality).Again, please, Does Gwern have anything that sounds as striking as “Empires Without Farms: The Case of Venice” or was that example a tacit hat tip to Brett Devereaux’s work? I don’t think the guy is a misanthrope but I do sense a wall of text—both figuratively and literally—between he and I when engaging with his writing. He is evidently well and widely read and despite my dislike for the visual form of his website I think that it is still a solid technical display of hypertext for personal web design and information architecture. But in spite of this all I find that it lacks depth, not intellectually but personally. ’Spiritually’, if you will.[1] Now you may be able figure out my reasoning for the first paragraph re: public figures and criticism. I guess that’s this puts me in the camp of those who don’t believe that’s possible to separate art from the artist. Discussing one commands a look into the other, otherwise why bother with ‘art’ and ‘artists’ at all?[2] Those who are familiar with both Graham’s and Cegłowski’s writing can take a guess at who once called the other a “big ole weenis” in an exchange on this very site.",

I know if I share it with them, chances are high no one will read it.On the one hand, the stuff I wrote is highly valuable to me - it's become an unintentional memoir. But on the other hand, I do want to share quite a bit with my friends, and I know they'll value it if they actually read it.I'll either have to cut a lot out, or write two versions (impractical).The point being that even when you have a very limited audience, it is important to care about them and sacrifice your needs to an extent.",

Master of Orion 2 was not bad either, but it was nowhere near\nas addictive and the gameplay was also more convoluted and slower.(Sometimes semi-new games are also ok such as Warcraft 3. I am not\nsaying ALL new games are bad, but it seems as if games were kind of\ndumbed down to be more like a video to watch, with semi-few interactive\nelements as you watch it. That's IMO not really a game. And just \nXP grinding for the big bad wolf to scale to the next level, deal\nout more damage, as your HP grows ... that's not really playing\neither. That's just wasting your time.)",

It’s much harder than taking the input from a microphone, inverting the signal, and feeding it into the output. There’s a lot of computation that needs to be done continuously.Using a powerful microcontroller isn’t a failure, it’s a benefit of having advanced semiconductor processes. Basically anything small and power efficient on a modern process will have no problem running at tens of MHz speeds. You want modern processes for the battery efficiency and you get speed as a bonus.The speed isn’t wasted, either. Higher clock speeds means lower latency. In a battery powered device having an MCU running at 48MHz may seem excessive until you realize that the faster it finishes every unit of work the sooner it can go to sleep. It’s not always about raw power.Modern earbuds are complicated. Having a general purpose MCU to allow software updates is much better than trying to get the entire wireless stack, noise cancellation, and everything else completely perfect before spinning out a custom ASIC.We’re very fortunate to have all of this at our disposal.

Maybe a device capable of transmitting PSTN-level audio quality wirelessly would have been popular twenty years ago, but nowadays most people wouldn't settle for anything with less than 44.1kHz bandwidth. A faster processor means that there's some room for software upgrades later on, future-proofing the device and potentially reducing electronic waste.

No one seems to think the excessive, useless, alarms are an issue and that any damage caused by missed warnings is the fault of the operator. When approaching management and engineering about this the responses range from \"it's not in the budget\" to \" you're maintenance, fix all the problems and the alarms will go away\".The only way for this kind of issue to be resolved is with regulation and safety standards. An operator can't safely operate equipment when alarms are not filtered or sorted in some way.

For example some errors aren't shown during takeoff since it's more important to focus on safely starting the climb, they would only be shown once past 400ft altitude.There is also a priority order based on criticality, they don't just show up in chronological order. Engine fire for example is a red warning and would always come above a yellow caution message. It's designed in a way where the results of the major problem (e.g. engine on fire, and then loosing electric power from that side) are lower priority than the problem itself.",

And engineers are just as likely to take the easy way out, like the caricature in the parent comment:For example, for the manufacturer's engineering team it's much easier, faster and cheaper to slap an alarm on everything than to learn attention management and to think through and create an attention management system that is effective and reliable (and it had better be reliable - imagine if it omits the wrong alarms!).

ECAM messages are flight safety critical messages requiring pilot action and they are organised by priority.ECAM messages are recorded by the DFDR/CVR but are not normally transmitted via ACARS. Pilots were not normally aware of ACARS messages (see MH370).Your point is a fair one though. In the case of AF447 the crew, against their training, made no attempt at all to work their way through the multiple ECAM messages with the appropriate checklist so they died. The final report on QF32 shows what a high workload this can be.Since AF447 was lost for nearly two years the ACARS messages were all that the investigators had to go on until they found the wreckage and the DFDR and CVR. Incidentally, one problem with those ACARS messages was that they are only timestamped to the minute and may arrive out of order which makes the interpretation of them more difficult.",

At the same time I'd work with the hospital to set up a debt repayment/forgiveness plan. Tax-exempt hospitals in the US (which is almost all of them I think) are required to have financial assistance policies to maintain their tax-exempt status.

While I don't agree with a lot of decisions Bluesky and the broader ATProto community have made, I am very excited that progress towards real decentralization is happening; Blacksky's app view, for instance, was the trigger for me to try to finally try to set up an account. I would love to see more of a focus on the parts of the system that make this difficult, so that myself and other people who are tired of coupling ourselves to centralized systems can participate. It's hard for me to trust that this is the direction the community is interested in moving, but I hope you prove me wrong.",

          "content": "> Working outside of did:plc is a choiceWhat you're saying is: working outside of centralization is a choice. did:plc is a centralized database controlled by Bluesky.Bluesky talks a big game about decentralization when it's extremely centralized. Everyone uses the centralized did:plc because it's the one way to really make it function. Until very recently, everyone used the centralized Bluesky AppView - and even now, well over 99% do. Bluesky will say things like \"the protocol is locked open\", but Bluesky could decide to shut off their firehose at anytime (leaving third parties cut off) and could decide to stop taking incoming data from third parties (leaving anyone on non-Bluesky servers cut off from basically everyone).In a lot of ways, Bluesky is more like Twitter a decade or so ago. It offers APIs that third parties can use to build off of - but at any time, Bluesky could shut down those APIs. Back then, you could read the Twitter firehose and store the tweets and create your own app view with your own front-end if you wanted. Tweets would need to be sent to the Twitter APIs, but that's not really different than your third-party PDS server sending them to Bluesky if you want anyone else to read them.You aren't open if someone controls the vast majority of a system because at any time they can decide \"why are we doing this open thing? we could probably force the <1% of people elsewhere to migrate to our service if we cut off interoperability.\" Google Talk (GChat) offered XMPP federation and a lot of people bought into the platform because it was open. At some point, Google realized that the promise of openness had served its purpose and closed it off.And it's important to think about the long-run here. Twitter was that benevolent dictator for a long time. Bluesky is still early and looking to grow - when they want people building off their system, giving them engagement, ideas, and designs they can copy. We're around year-5 of Bluesky. A decade from now after Bluesky builds its popularity on the back of \"we're open and decentralized\" while making decentralization extremely difficult, will that change? If Bluesky gets to a few hundred million users and then a third party starts looking like a potential threat, maybe they'll cut that off before they have genuine competition.Maybe that won't happen with Bluesky. Maybe their investors won't care about the potential for a pay day. But if they have control (either through centralization like did:plc or by controlling the vast majority of the network), there will always be the potential for them to break interoperability. If they start monetizing Bluesky, why should they keep hosting, processing, and serving all that data for third party clients they can't monetize? Why shouldn't they stop federating with third parties before a third party becomes competition?",

People are eager to move off because a lot of users really really don't like bluesky PBC leadership but it's a matter of waiting for these third party communities to reach critical mass.- Relay infra is already pretty much decentralised. Lots of people still rely on the main relay but it's trivial to use a third party relay and there's more of them than you can count.- There are a lot of really high quality third party clients and afaict a lot of users do actually use third party clients but there's basically no metric for tracking these stats.- Appviews are expensive currently and there's work on making them easier to host but there's already one \"full\" alternative appview for bluesky.- There are a lot non-bluesky apps/services that are genuinely high quality experiences and they are gaining their own communities.The main technical barrier to true decentralisation outside of improving UX is introducing other did:methods and/or spreading trust of did:plc across the community (ex: clustered via raft or paxos across major operators) but there's just not a reason to pursue this over the other fires that need fighting in the ecosystem right now (and keeping did diversity low reduces another source of complexity the space just doesn't need to tackle yet).--------------TLDR: it is intentional because the goal is to in order of priorities:1. get the architecture for eventual decentralisation right.2. make it exist.3. make it good.4. make it easy to use for normal people.5. build community.6. focus on decentralisation.Decentralisation in theory is the first priority but in practice it's the last priority.

Personally, I don’t mind marketing stuff, if it’s interesting and relevant (like this).But the fact that most comms cables, these days, have integrated chips, makes for a dangerous trust landscape. That’s something that we’ve known for quite some time.BTW: I “got it right,” but not because of the checklist. I just knew that a single chip is likely a lot cheaper than a board with many components, and most counterfeits are about selling cheap shit, for premium prices.But if it were a spy cable, it would probably look almost identical (and likely would have a considerably higher BOM).",

Real IC, fake cable (eg, I buy the FTDI IC and make the cable, and sell it as an \"official\" FTDI cable).(1) is I assume what they mean in this instance., but you could argue (2) is also possible. However, they make no mention of the packaging both calling them \"FTDI\" cables. Instead, I assume they're going off what they report to the OS as.FTDI have been around for decades, and the offhand \"old cable we had kicking around\" could easily mean its 15+ years old. That might easily explain the chip size difference. In this case, FTDI did make TSSOP 28-pin chips for a long time. They're now obsolete, superseded by SSOP package variants (like in the \"Real\" picture). Put another way, this is like comparing an i5-10400 to a Pentium II that I found in my storage closet and declaring the Pentium II fake.The actual fake chips visually look identical to the real ones. Obviously, otherwise they wouldn't get mixed into the supply chain.The only real conclusion they can realistically make from these x-rays are that they're not the same cable (but even then, I don't know if FTDI real cables have silently upgraded the internals while retaining the same SKU).",

You see, CPUs usually have direct access to only one PCI/e in most consumer hardware. The other PCI/e and mvme.2 slots share the same bandwidth and take turns. When someone wants access, they do a dance with the CPU and other parts of the computer using INT or (or interrupt) instructions that make the CPU pause so I/O can take over for a bit. The switching back and forth is costly too and adds up quickly.That said, it wouldn’t explain why a MacBook (which should have the SSD already on the fastest/dedicated pathway) be this slow unless something else in the OS was the bottleneck?I think we’re just scratching the surface here and there is more to this story that is waiting to be discovered.

Each had its own idiosyncrasies, like how everything is a file on Linux, and you're supposed to write programs by chaining existing executables together, or on the desktop, both Win32 and X11 started out with their own versions of UI elements, so XWindow or Win32 would know about where a 'button' was, and the OS was responsible for event handling and drawing stuff.Eventually both Windows and Linux programs moved to a model where the OS just gave you the window as a drawing surface, and you were supposed to fill it.Similarly, all other OS supplied abstractions slowly fell out of use beyond the bare minimum.Considering this, I wonder if it's time to design a new, much lower level abstraction, for file systems in this case, this would be a way to mmap an entire directory into the process space, where each file would be a struct, whicha had a list of pointers for the pages on the disk, and each directory would be a list of such entries, again stored in some data structure you could access, synchronizing reads/writes would be orechestrated by the kernel somehow (I'm thinking locking/unlocking pages being written to).So that way there'd be no difference between traversing an in-memory data structure and reading the disk.I know this approach isnt super compatible with the async/await style of I/O, however I'm not 100% convinced that's the correct approach either (disk paging is a fundamental feature of all OSes, yet is absolutely inexpressible in programming terms)",

This scene only appears in the director's cut of the film. Anyway, bearing in mind it was released in 1986, imagine my utter shock when Hicks busts out a couple of laptops to monitor and manage the guns. The machines in question are a pair of GRiD Compasses, originally released in, I think, 1984. Imagine that: a laptop computer from 1984. They're not even that big and cumbersome.Of course, the specs are laughable by today's standards but actually pretty decent for the period, and especially for portables. In terms of memory and raw CPU power they'd certainly have wiped the floor with the average home computer of the day, although graphics capabilities might have been non-existent, and sound would have been PC speaker at best.So, yeah, Nedry with a tablet? I can buy that. His whole den/lair is like a toy box of the coolest hardware and software from the early 1990s. But for all the times I've seen the film, I've never spotted this before.",

Therefore its use in the movie does not have any fantastic element in it.They have patented the clamshell form, so all the early laptop manufacturers had to license their patent.GRiD Compass was designed since the beginning with the main goal of  being a computer that can be carried in a briefcase (at that time, engineers and programmers normally carried briefcases, not backpacks like today). This was somewhat similar with how the first \"scientific\" calculator had been designed by Hewlett-Packard, with the main goal of fitting inside a shirt pocket.There have been a number of earlier portable computers, made by IBM, Xerox, Scrib, Sony, Epson, Osborne and a few others, but most of those were much more cumbersome and more difficult to carry (they were nicknamed \"sewing machine\" computers, for their size and weight), mainly because they had CRT displays, while GRiD Compass had a beautiful flat electroluminescent display.Before GRiD Compass, there had also been a few Japanese portable computers with flat LCD screens, but in those the screen could not be folded, the body of the computer was in one piece, containing both the screen and the keyboard, like in an oversized calculator, so their screens were very small and they used very weak CPUs in comparison with GRiD Compass, which had an Intel 8086 (but it was not compatible with the IBM PC, as it was launched when the IBM PC was only 8 months old and not yet as important as it has become later).",

SGI invested heavily in the graphical capabilities, including 3D rendering, and therefore when the industry graduated from Amigas with the \"Video Toaster\" they slid into SGI systems quite nicely.So it stood to reason that a couple of them would show up in an actual film.

He first visited Gehenna (Hell).He saw a vast hall with long tables covered in the most magnificent foods. But the people sitting there were skeletal and wailing in agony. As the Rabbi looked closer, he saw that every person had wooden slats splinted to their arms, stretching from their shoulders to their wrists. Their arms were perfectly straight and stiff; they could pick up a spoon, but they could not bend their elbows to bring the food to their own mouths. They sat in front of a feast, starving in bitterness.The Rabbi then visited Gan Eden (Heaven). To his surprise, he saw the exact same hall, the same tables, and the same magnificent food. Even more shocking, the people there also had wooden slats splinted to their arms, keeping them from bending their elbows.\n But here, the hall was filled with laughter and song. The people were well-fed and glowing. As the Rabbi watched, he saw a man fill his spoon and reach across the table, placing the food into the mouth of the man sitting opposite him. That man, in turn, filled his spoon and fed his friend.The Rabbi returned to Hell and whispered to one of the starving men, \"You do not have to starve! Reach across and feed your neighbor, and he will feed you.\"\n The man in Hell looked at him with spite and replied, \"What? You expect me to feed that fool across from me? I would rather starve than give him the pleasure of a full belly!\"",

But I’m going to give you my unsolicited opinion on the writing style.The writing style sounds more like a tech bro describing some weekend conquest, and is wholly unappealing to most of the space industry (or at least the ones with decision making authority). Your CMGs were “locked in,” several times you “nailed it,” and so on.You might have a business strategy that I’m not aware of but I’d expect that most of your market is controlled by aging men in suits, and they don’t talk like this. Most startups and tech bros aren’t spending money on space. It’s big established corporations that can fund this kind of stuff. Write like them. You can talk like a tech bro and get seed funding, but if you want to get to a sustainable business you have to talk corporate.I would hate for your company to get passed over for lucrative opportunities because your public image seems immature. I looked at your website and you have a bunch of ex-government people on your senior advisory board. Get their opinion on your writing. It sounds silly, but you significantly lower your probability of winning contracts if people see you as a team of “bros.” People don’t want to spend millions on guys who are “locked in.” People want to spend millions on people who do professional engineering and risk reduction and clearly communicate how professional and competent they are.I ranted way too long about your writing style.

But I'd argue the diffraction limit is an incomplete metric as well, like how spatial sampling is balanced with other MTF contributors (e.g. jitter/smear). For complete metrics, we like 1) NIIRS or 2) % contrast for a given object size on the ground (i.e. system MTF translated to ground units, not image-space units).The main performance goal for us was NIIRS 7, and we decomposed GSD/MTF/SNR contributors optimized for affordability when we architected the system",

Going forward, we're writing everything top to bottom, just to simplify and have total ownership since we're basically there already.For testing we hit it at multiple levels: unit test, hardware in the loop, a custom \"flight software in test\" we called \"FIT\" which executed a few different simulated mission scenarios, and we tried to hit as many fault cases as we could too. It was pretty stressful for the team tbh but they were super stoked to see how well it worked on orbit.A big one for us in a super high resolution mission like this is the timing determinism (low latency/low jitter) of the guidance, navigation, and control (GNC) thread. Basically it needs execute on time, every cycle, for us to achieve the mission.

Their aims may align with the protestors temporarily but I think a permanently fractured, Syria type situation is much more palatable to them than a rapid transition to a more democratic system that leaves the country intact. There is no guarantee a post-islamic Iran would step into line, and it would remain a regional power that would be much harder to justify continued sanctions against.A part of me suspects the incredibly conspicuous endorsement of the protestors by the US/Israel regime is an attempt to discredit them. A zombie regime under the Mullahs will likely to continue to implode economically, which means they are less able to defend themselves from US/Israeli attacks in the future. A clean change of government with domestic US pressure to lift sanctions would be their nightmare scenario.",

It is not just the Iran situation though.We make decisions all the time that result in immense amount of unnecessary suffering because of a total lack of rationality.Our food consumption choices alone have created the objectively largest and most horrific engine of suffering in the history of this planet, all for the pleasure of our taste buds. The average person is directly responsible for this.It is the irrationality and lack of empathy of the average person that bothers me. Unless you show them a video of protestors being massacred in Iran, or take them to a factory farm, they don't care. And even then, they often don't care. Why?Suffering is roughly sortable and it is certainly within the power of most people to drive down the greatest sources of suffering, and pressure their government to do so when it is not directly within their power.But people are irrational.",

          "content": "Yes, SKIP LOCKED is great. In practice you nearly always want LIMIT, which the article did not mention. Be careful if your selection spans multiple tables: only the relations you explicitly lock are protected (see SELECT … FOR UPDATE OF t1, t2). ORDER BY matters because it controls fairness and retry behaviour. Also watch ANALYZE: autoanalyze only runs once the dead to live tuple threshold is crossed, and on large or append heavy tables with lots of old rows this can lag, leading to poor plans and bad SKIP LOCKED performance. Finally, think about deletion and lifecycle: deleting on success, scheduled cleanup (consider pg_cron), or partitioning old data all help keep it efficient.",

We just choose to sacrifice/maim X-number of humans every year so folks can continue to zoom around and structurally increase sprawl/pollution (which in turn have their own massive un-internalized costs).All of us pay for these subsidies via significantly higher healthcare prices.Look up what happened to the Michigan laws/policies that required drivers to actually pay for insurance that would compensate accident victims for their death and suffering.

Tesla runs 0 self-driving taxis.The problem with Waymo is simple: at the price they're doing it, it isn't worth doing. Waymo only works with real drivers ready to take over at the first sign of trouble, so it's at best level 3 self driving, definitely not level 4. This may compare favorably with Tesla's taxis who failed level 3 self-driving and proved to be unsafe at level 2, which really is failing level 2 if we're honest.I mean, Musk SCREAMs in the news they're improving, but let's not forget this is the same Musk that promised level 5 self-driving by 2016 (2014 if you count ...). And if you can tell: yes, I'm still pissed about believing him enough to pay for that.",

AFAIR AppKit already provides a native tabbing API where you can “just” (that “just” is doing a lot of heavy lifting) implement a few delegate methods and you get tabbing behavior for free, especially on document-based apps. (Sorry, I do not remember the specifics, it might have been a tad more difficult)I’m not updated on the SwiftUI equivalent, but I would imagine that a similar API would exist much alike API for multiple windows or multiple documents.I think everyone would benefit from a “why” explanation (which I definitely think would exist, since I’ve used too many AppKit APIs in pain), and also some screenshots for a demo app (so that we can expect how it would look and how much the look and feel would deviate from the native counterparts).",

It's underbaked and awkward to fit into a model where your \"tab data model\" doesn't neatly fit the document data model that the framework wants.I recently made an app where I wanted tabs, and I just ended up abandoning tab support for this reason, and adding a todo item to use an off-the-shelf tab UI library in the future.",

And in fact when it came time to discuss future Photos features there was always a contingent pushing to add back features that were lost in the transition away from Aperture.While I was there, for example, they pushed (and got) Curves added to the editing pane. Levels had always been there but the purists missed the more laser-focused \"curve\" adjustments.They wanted, did not get, the ability to \"brush\" a setting (the way you might dodge/burn an area of the image).These days, who knows.

You can edit EXIF data on the original image but the app's internal database is completely immutable. I have a handful of photos with inconsistent metadata I'd love to fix and the only option appears to be removing them from the library and re-adding them.I really don't need many features! I'm not a pro and while I wouldn't mind shelling out a one-time fee for good software I'm not paying a subscription for cloud storage I'm not going to use.

It also seems browser-related as it has different behavior in Firefox and Falkon (which uses QtWebEngine / Chromium).

If there are tons of new flip flops we resynthesize and start over.Lots of chips have metal spins to fix errors.  The blank areas of the chips are filled with filler cells but most of them are special \"ECOFILLER\" cells that are basically generic pairs of N/P transistors like a gate array.  These can then be turned into any kind of cell just by using metal.  They are a little slower but work fine.I've worked at one huge company where they planned 3 full base layer mask sets and 1-2 metal spins for each full base layer set.  This was when doing a chip on a brand new process node where you couldn't always trust the models the fab gave you so you wanted more post silicon characterization to recalibrate models.",

When choosing a cell to visit, pop the last cell off the first non-empty list. It's considerably faster than the standard tree algorithm, but more importantly, changing N has a dramatic impact on the texture of the maze (compare 1 2 4 8 etc on a decently large maze).",
