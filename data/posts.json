      "abstract": "该讨论围绕欧盟针对无限滚动设计的监管提议展开。核心话题是欧盟将无限滚动视为成瘾性设计的案例进行规制，而非直接立法禁止。多数用户认同科技公司利用成瘾设计掠夺用户注意力的问题，有人认为“万亿美元公司正在发动注意力战争”，支持监管以保护用户权益。\n\n争议点集中在监管方式和优先级上。有用户质疑欧盟为何优先针对无限滚动而非其他更严重的社会影响问题，并呼吁提供相关研究数据。也有用户指出过度监管可能带来负面体验，以Cookie弹窗为例说明“微管理”可能造成使用噩梦。部分用户批评欧盟政策过于琐碎，认为“美国和中国在发展超级智能时，欧洲却在管理用户习惯”，甚至担忧会催生规避限制的技术工具。\n\n讨论中提到，尽管对监管手段存在分歧，但社区普遍认同科技公司利用成瘾性设计牟利是核心问题。有用户强调“问题从来不是孩子，而是试图让孩子沉迷广告平台获利的科技高管”。整体上，支持监管者与质疑监管有效性者形成主要对立，同时存在对监管过度干涉设计自由的批评声音。",

          "content": "Here's the actual statement from the European Comission: https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/ip_26_...It's important to note they aren't creating laws against infinite scrolling, but are ruling against addictive design and pointing to infinite scrolling as an example of it. The wording here is fascinating, mainly because they're effectively acting as arbiters of \"vibes\". They point to certain features they'd like them to change, but there is no specific ruling around what you can/can't do.My initial reaction was that this was a terrible precedent, but after thinking on it more I asked myself, \"well what specific laws would I write to combat addictive design?\". Everything I thought of would have some way or workaround that could be found, and equally would have terrible consequences on situations where this is actually quite valuable. IE if you disallow infinite scrolling, what page sizes are allowed? Can I just have a page of 10,000 elements that lazy load?Regardless of your take around whether this is EU overreach, I'm glad they're not implementing strict laws around what you can/can't do - there are valuable situations for these UI patterns, even if in combination they can create addictive experiences. Still, I do think that overregulation here will lead to services being fractured. I was writing about this earlier this morning (https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=47005367), but the regulated friction of major platforms (ie discord w/ ID laws) is on a collision course with the ease of vibe coding up your own. When that happens, these comissions are going to need to think long and hard around having a few large companies to watch over is better than millions of small micro-niche ones.",

But ultimately it often turns out fine. Change can bring new problems, but it also brings positives that are hard to understand and even formulate, that's culture. Trying to be the arbiter of that is foolish.Is ticktock addictive because of it's design, or is it addictive because it brings thousands of people and experiences and emotions right to you? Probably both, but it's hard to separate one from the other. Apps are not opium, it's not as clear cut.Instead of micromanaging technology and culture they should make sure that society is kind, that there is slack in the system, that people don't have reason to want to flee their real lives, that those hurt by new technology get support.Of course truly malicious dark patterns and fraud should be punished.

One example that comes to mind is how they're both pushing for more privacy online while also pushing for things such as chat control which is antithetical to privacy.Does social media need regulating?

They expect precise and well-defined constraints in the letter of the law.Most European countries, and the EU as a legislative body, work with the premise of the spirit of the law. It is less precise and requires real world judgment to determine its boundaries but it can be much harder to side-step with technicalities and \"gotchas\" using loopholes in the letter of the law.It's just a different system, in my opinion it's less exploitable even though it's riskier.

It feels like someone changed the keyboard to optimize for some typing behavior that doesn't match my own, so the \"optimizations\" work against me. It's reminiscent of when the US Air Force redesigned their cockpits to match pilots' average measurements, only to discover that using averages just made the cockpits bad for everybody.[1][1] https://noblestatman.com/uploads/6/6/7/3/66731677/cockpit.fl...",

I upgraded because my 13 mini was slow, and I chose Apple in the first place because they had some of the best performing phones (especially cpu/gpu; they always had less ram but before llm it didn’t matter).The keyboard is horrible, but I don’t trust Google or Microsoft keyboards either; I think my next phone will be graphene; just waiting to see who their new hardware partner is.I loved Apple TV because it was fast; under 26 it is slow.I chose Mac for best in class hardware. That is unfortunately unchanged; really hoping snapdragon X 2 elite has good Linux support.My Apple Watch, despite doing nothing new it didn’t used to do, has also become slow and annoying, and its battery was never as good as it should have been. When I jump to Android I think garmin is probably the best choice, but maybe there are good wearables now. Unfortunately Android doesn’t have its act together re:built in health data database.Replacing Athlytic and keeping my history will be one of the biggest challenges in the transition.Competitors unfortunately still have huge blind spots even if some of the core experiences are better.",

It had bands across the screen where it could only detect one finger at a time. Once you picked up typing speed it ended up in similar misses you see in the YouTube video, albeit even worse (you end up with a letter between your two fingers).Eventually found two simple but effective ways to improve autocorrect/typing performance. First build a personalized and adaptive touch model trained on the device itself, mainly to fix simple typos.\nSecond to fix low end screen limitations, use simple heuristics based on touchstart, touchmove and touchend [1].Anyways, I'm no iPhone user but interesting to read. It would drive me nuts.[0]: https://www.brianweet.com/2015/03/24/implement-touch-model.h...\n[1]: https://www.brianweet.com/2015/04/08/low-end-touchscreen-lim...",

Was a strictly Pixel phone user for my last 4 phones. Recently jumped over to iPhone. For the most part I’m enjoying it.There are minor things, like the keyboard being annoying to type with. For instance, when I’m typing something into the URL bar of Safari, for some reason, I’m constantly hitting the period key next to the space bar, and I feel like I’m not anywhere close to it.I also find it confusing how to dismiss the keyboard. Android had a very clear icon for this, on iOS it’s just a checkmark which is a little misleading in my opinion.On iOS, speech to text is pretty good, but I have to annunciate clearly, where I felt that android was a little bit more forgiving.Another issue I’ve noticed is that I don’t think the GPS (or maybe it’s just Google maps) is as accurate as it is on android. On iOS, if I’m on a highway it sometimes thinks I’m on the shoulder road next to the highway. So I’m constantly being rerouted to get back on the highway. I felt like I didn’t have that on android.Back to the blue bubble thing though. Being the one and only android user amongst my friends and even my wife, I was always hearing about how I ruined the chat. I didn’t realize until switching over to iOS just how integrated everything is and what you can do in the chat when everybody else is on iOS, like editing previous messages, being able to answer messages via your Messages app on your laptop, and of course, not having images and videos getting compressed terribly. Although RCS chat improved that more recently.One thing I do love is that automation and shortcuts is something that’s natively part of the system and that I don’t  to install some app like Tasker or whatever the more modern version of that is.At this point, I really like both of the OSes. What made me actually finally switch over was that everyone I knew who had an iPhone would have it for like five or more years and I was going through pixel phones every two years. I got tired of spending all that money.",

Clearly tapping a letter “taps” a different letter (hot spots poorly calibrated) 2. A correctly tapped letter (keyboard highlight indicates correct letter) but incorrect letter is rendered on documentAnyone irl I’ve discussed the iPhone keyboard with has described frustration so I figured this as more a “some of us are annoyed” flare than a technical manifesto.As another commenter noted I put a tiny link to my slightly more detailed blog post once this started gaining traction but I’m just having fun here really.Happy Friday the 13th everyone!",

There seems to be pseudo image clipboard support but it's mostly limited to pasting between Chrome tabs afaict.My switching was due to a build up of minor frictions and frustrations with feeling like a second class citizen on iOS because I use largely gsuite apps rather than being bought into the Apple way for everything, with the last straw being the limitations on Pebble functionality.",

They obfuscate problems regular users are having by drowning them out with praise for Apple.During my last weeks on the iPhone, I reached out to various Apple discussion spaces on the web for help with some problems I was having.I was met not with assistance, but ridicule. The majority of the people \"helping\" were saying some variation of \"you're holding it wrong\" or \"I personally don't have that problem\" (which is such a funny quirk of the Apple fandom - I didn't ask if you are having that problem, I'm asking for help achieving a specific outcome).You can even see examples of this sort of behavior in that post about the window resize handles for the latest version of macOS. There were Apple fans saying some variation of it's not an actual problem, that they don't have that problem, that they don't use the window resize handles anyway, or that the post was an exaggeration. Turns out it was an actual problem that Apple addressed with a bug fix. Of course, Apple fans, being shameless, will jump to reframing the discussion from \"Apple can do no wrong\" to \"See, Apple listens! You know who doesn't listen? Microsoft!!\" I get it, not a monolith, but recognizing Apple fans aren't a monolith doesn't make them less off-putting.The final nail in the coffin for me for the ecosystem was getting called a child for *checks notes* making the adult decision to move to Android to have a phone that did the things I needed (with much fewer annoying, uncritical fans and a lot more people who genuinely want to help).So, yes, there is a danger in letting the fandom do all the work and laughing off \"threats\" of user exoduses. The conduct of Apple fans coupled with Apple's ignorance to regular users' feedback soured me to the ecosystem. It would take a lot to bring me back.

It is pretty well understood that in normal situations the vast majority of people are not vocal even if they feel the same way about things the vocal people are saying. As an example I use a lot, congress critters use a formula to get the pulse of the constituents. If they receive a hand written letter (yes, I learned about the formula when people did that), they'd multiply that by some factor knowing that if one person felt strongly enough to send in a letter that others also felt that way. Phone calls were the same, but with a smaller multiplier as it was easier to make a call that write a letter followed by emails with yet a smaller mult. This was all well before social media, but I'd imagine searching tweets would give a pretty good indicator as well now. A single tweet would be worth something, but tweets with lots of retweets and heavy comment activity would be something else. Even if a tweet is something done pretty much on a whim with little thought behind it like that letter.The silent majority is called that for a reason. It doesn't mean they are happy or content.

It is precisely this impulse -- the desire to punish bad behavior by means of public accusation -- that the AI was indulging or emulating when it wrote its blog post.What if the blog post had been written by a human rather than an AI?

SOLID, functional-style and favoring immutability.

Also book-learning driven. I’ll concede that at a micro level, finagling how to make the system stable did require time in the saddle.But these days when I’m reading a PR, I’m doing static analysis which is primarily not about what has come out of my fingers but what has gone into my brain.

Later on this was diluted to 8%.8% of a $380 billion valuation would be a cool 30 billion which I think would have covered the entirety of the fraud and left money for SBF and its friends.But thankfully around June 2024, the clawback of stolen funds by FTX had its Anthropic shares sold for about $450 million.I'm glad to know SBF and its scammers friends are going to see exactly jack fucking shit of that money.",

I think short term there's a ton of money to be made by investing in these companies. In the long run I don't see how they survive, since nobody in the big leagues has a real technological advantage over anybody else so stiff competition will keep prices low. Even if they cartelize, a startup could beat them on price since there's not much preventing anyone with enough capital from building their own \"frontier\" models now, except GPU shortages...

Would it be worth Apple to bring Anthropic in house? They failed to deliver AI themselves, they know the risks of being dependent on Google. If AI goes far enough it may totally remove Apple's differentiation.Some of the Big Techs are building their own in house stuff (Meta, Google), but it wouldn't be crazy to see acquisitions by the others, especially if the market cools slightly.

These companies are valued like monopolists, but the competitive dynamics make them more akin to tomato sauce makers. I understand that the technology is pretty amazing and can lead to significant productivity gains, but from a business perspective, the question is how much of that value Antrophic and others can capture over time.",

They know if they create the idea that AI progress is at an unstoppable velocity decision makers will begin handing them their engineering budgets.

Rust is amazing in so many ways but it has been quite a brutal road to trying to support io-uring ok, and efforts are still a bit primitive, shall we say. If Zig can nail this down that would be fantastic!!I would way rather Zig keep learning and keep changing, keep making new and better.

When updating a 3rd-party dependency to a new major version it's also expected that the code needs to be fixed (except in Zig those breaking changes are in the minor versions, but for 0.x that's also expected).I actually hope that even after 1.x, Zig will have a strategy to keep the stdlib lean by aggressively removing deprecated interfaces (maybe via separate stdlib interface versions, e.g. `const std = @import(\"std/v1\");`, those versions could be slim compatibility wrappers around a single core stdlib implementation.",

As long as their philosophical approach to safety is such that Zig makes writing unsafe code easy and Rust avoids it as much as possible, then writing unsafe code in Zig will always be easier.",

Babylon 5 is underappreciated, but it has mainly good episodes and several amazing ones.[0]However, if I can be cynical for a moment: The article title is misleading. Only a few episodes have been uploaded so far. At the current rate of one episode per week, it will take until March 2028 to conclude all five seasons. That's assuming they post every episode, and allow the episodes to remain up in the long term.For some reason, the first episode of season 1, Midnight on the Firing Line, is missing from the YouTube upload, which is a pretty critical omission. YouTube is also a minefield of spoilers in the video recommendations. I can't recommend the YouTube uploads to newcomers right now.

          "content": "B5 is still one of my favourite TV shows of all time.The common criticisms are largely true: it does start slow with some weak episodes in season 1, some of the acting is a bit wooden, the CGI hasn’t aged well, season 5 is slightly anti-climactic because they largely wrapped up the main plot arc in season 4 in case the final season didn’t happen.On the other hand, it had an epic storyline that spanned not just episodes but multiple seasons in a way that no-one had really tried in sci-fi before. That storyline made sense and weaves in and out of the individual episodes because it was planned out in advance. The world-building and development of different cultures and how they relate is generally strong.Against that over-arching backdrop, it also had a lot of good individual episodes. They had genuine character development. They explored social and moral issues as well as any show of that period. They varied from diplomatic and political settings to the adventure of deep space exploration to almost pure action episodes. They varied in scale too, from relatable stories about a single individual, to stories about a whole planet or culture, right up to the fate of the known universe.Much of the acting criticism is directed at the main leader characters, but I’ve always thought this is slightly unfair, because the script often relies on those characters to carry the plot and provide much of the exposition and those tend to be the more formulaic parts. The same show also features some of the best acting and main character arcs in TV sci-fi, with the relationship between Londo Mollari (played by Peter Jurasik) and G'Kar (Andreas Katsulas) being one of the great double acts. There were many good moments from the rest of the ensemble cast too, from the doctor wrestling with his conscience to a certain wave. And then there were some great supporting/recurring roles, from the light relief of Zathras (and Zathras, Zathras, Zathras, Zathras and Zathras, of course) to the much more serious Bester (arguably Walter Koenig’s finest work).If you haven’t watched B5 and you’re a fan of epic space sci-fi, I highly recommend it even with its flaws. The first season is a slow burner (although it also has a lot of subtle set-up that you won’t appreciate until much later) but it picks up. If you’re the type of viewer who can’t stand filler episodes, there used to be some relatively spoiler-free guides to which early episodes you really need to watch and which you can skip, so you could look for one of those. Don’t watch In The Beginning first, though; it’s a prequel TV movie that has lots of spoilers about the main story that you’re not supposed to know yet when you watch the early series.",

Or hell, even an entirely different show.In my opinion he's one of the few people in the industry who actually knows how to skillfully write a coherent TV show. And by that I mean: he actually pre-planned the story (spanning multiple seasons!) of B5 right from the beginning, instead of completely making it up on the fly like so many other shows. Subtle things which might seem inconsequential, appearing in the very first season, can foreshadow events happening seasons later. This makes it, at least for me, much more coherent and enjoyable to watch, and I wish more writers/showrunners would adopt this approach (instead of the usual writers' room + only plan until the end of the season approach which is so common today).",

They are both very good, in wildly different ways.B5 is much more character driven and more of a slow burn that sets up a big payoff in the later seasons that has permanent world-changing impact.  It was really ahead of its time, closer to something like Game of Thrones than anything else at the time.TNG feels more static, even the \"big events\" don't really change the world all that much in the next episode, except Tasha Yar being written out of the show in season 1 causing Worf's head to shrink in season 2 or something I guess.  It's a mystery-of-the-week show, you know what you're gonna get and you know it's good.  No complaints, but also nothing mind blowing.",

Ironically the most scientifically grounded series is TOS because they didn't have a ton of franchise tropes to lean on and actually hired science fiction writers now and then. I remember one episode where they encountered a (Romulan?) cloaking device for the first time, a major plot point was the 2nd law of thermodynamics and the fact that such a cloak couldn't be perfect - it had to vent energy somewhere, somehow - which is a degree of scientific rigor no subsequent series would even attempt. And then in another episode they fought Space Lincoln so YMMV. By the time you get to TNG any pretense at science is abandoned for \"teching the tech\" and inverted space wedgies and whatever nonsense Q gets up to.That said, B5 absolutely does wear its fantasy pretensions on its sleeve, and I think you're correct about the \"forward looking\" versus \"backwards looking\" themes. The technomages are wizards with robes and mystical incantations and everything - it's explained away as \"technology so advanced it's indistinguishable from magic\" but they wouldn't be out of place in any D&D setting. Mystical prophecies, gods, demons, \"light vs. dark\" motifs, the Minbari being so elf-coded it's ridiculous, the Great Man heroic ideal, sacred tomes, eldritch ruins, crystals crystals crystals.

It's a goofy plot full of weird pseudo-scientific mysticism with a \"special guest of the week\" who basically never returns (excluding books and movies), so in most shows meets several definitions of skippable, but this episode also introduces Dr. Franklin, has several key Sinclair and Garibaldi moments, provides background lore for the Minbari and foreshadows certain Minbari things to come.That's just the second episode of the season. (Truly a rough start for some.)Another common example is \"TKO\". It's a silly boxing match episode, much of it doesn't do much for the series except set up some of Garibaldi's goofier side and maybe foreshadowing Garibaldi's flaws.

I tried to get into it and it’s frustrating.New release titles often skip blu-ray entirely, especially for demographics that don’t care for the format like kids content. Either that or new titles will skip 4K so you’ll be paying $25 for 1080p when $10 will get you 4K digital. Then when you redeem the movies anywhere code, you don’t get 4K because your blu-ray is only 1080p.I thought it would be cool to get into some classic 4K upscale cinephile releases like Lawrence of Arabia but it turns out that I can buy the 4K version on Apple TV for like $5 where getting your hands on the disc is like a hundred bucks.I certainly appreciate the disc releases from outlets like Criterion but $40+ for a movie seems so hard to justify.The 4K experience on providers like Apple is so excellent, the benefits of blu-ray are so minimal if any at all.Another random example, my Studio Ghibli transfers on blu-ray are clearly worse quality than HBO Max, and there are no 4K blu-rays except for The Boy and the Heron. There is no motivation to re-do any disc releases of those movies on 4K UHD because nobody is going to buy them.My feeling is that despite the licensing pitfalls of digital ownership, I’ve concluded that it just makes more sense compared to physical media.

While it's pretty, it's also just a very subtle, non-critical background animation effect. Not being a CSS guru myself, here's what Gemini says:> \"Specifically, this is a Scrim or Easing Gradient. Instead of a simple transition between two colors, it uses 16 color stops to mimic a \"cubic-bezier\" mathematical curve. This creates a smoother, more natural fade than a standard linear gradient, but it forces the browser to calculate high-precision color math across the entire surface during every scroll repaint.\"My Firefox smooth scrolls like butter on thousands of pages, so you might want ask your web designer to test on non-Mac, iGPU laptops with hiDPI and consider the performance cost of web pages with always-running subtle background animations in a world of diverse hardware platforms.

The web app is our main investment, but I think there's a slice of developers who really like to interact with TUIs, so I'm going to keep working on it.For the demo at https://tui.hatchet.run, to answer some messages asking about it: I built this with the fantastic ghostty-web project (https://github.com/coder/ghostty-web). It's been a while since I've used WASM for anything and this made it really easy. I deployed the demo across six Fly.io regions (hooray stateless apps) to try to minimize the impact of keystroke latency, but I imagine it's still felt by quite a few people.",

It's not quite full integration, but the UI is so much easier to use, because you can be more precise. Rather than having a global \"more information\" toggle that expands everything like in Claude Code or Pi or whatever, I can specifically inspect the bits of information that I'm interested in. There's two parallel subagents running and one of them is doing unusual things? I can explore exactly what it's doing in more detail.It helps that VSCode has really improved in the last couple of releases - before then, the features available in Claude Code were useful though that it was worth using despite the baggage, and there's still a handful of things I miss in VSCode. But I think the visual information density and acuity that you can get out of a GUI application is far beyond what you can ever achieve in a TUI, and I think as these tools start reaching something like feature parity, that makes GUIs a lot nicer to use.",

I’ve had some good success with a few Kickstarter projects but I’ve been very selective about which projects I support. More often than not I can identify when a team is in over their heads or think they’re just going to figure out the details later, after the money arrives.For a period of time it was popular for the industrial designers I knew to try to launch their own Kickstarters. Their belief was that engineering was a commodity that they could hire out to the lowest bidder after they got the money. The product design and marketing (their specialty) was the real value. All of their projects either failed or cost them more money than they brought in because engineering was harder than they thought.I think we’re in for another round of this now that LLMs give the impression that the software and firmware parts are basically free. All of those project ideas people had previously that were shelved because software is hard are getting another look from people who think they’re just going to prompt Claude until the product looks like it works.",

While it’s easy to get something out of an EEG set, it takes some work to get good quality data that’s not riddled with noise (mains hum, muscle artifacts, blinks, etc).

Vim is the improved version of vi(1), a lot more commands and a scripting language.The plugin system is similar to everything that was unix at that time, relying on a variable like $PATH.

If you have a public presence, are patient enough, or a friend or colleague of someone trusted, you can become trusted. With solid provenance, trust doesn’t have to be carefully guarded, because it can be revoked and the offender’s reputation can be damaged such that it’s hard to regain. Also, small sites could form webs of trust with each other, trusting and revoking other sites within the larger network in the same manner that people are vouched or revoked within each site (similar to the town -> state -> government -> world hierarchy); then you only need to gain the trust of an easy group (e.g. physically local or of a niche hobby you’re an expert in) to gain trust in far away groups who trust that entire group.",

I'd actually say it's quite the opposite: in 2026, Russia has never been more disconnected from the Western parts of the Internet than it is now (the Russian Internet watchdog blocks like 30% of foreign resources since a few years ago, while Russian IPs are routinely banned on Western sites after 2022, I can barely open anything without a VPN).For that reason, and because of limited English proficiency, Russian netizens rarely visit foreign resources these days, except for a few platforms without a good Russian replacement like Instagram and YouTube (both banned btw, only via a VPN), where they usually stay  mostly within their Russian-speaking communities. I'm not sure why any of them would be the reason the Internet as a whole has supposedly become low-trust.

The burial chamber [2] is a large structure in the approximate middle. [3]It hasn't settled or shifted enough to deviate or crush this significantly.  But such shifting was a recurring problem in early Pyramids though.  The foundation work must have been an incredible undertaking.> [The King's Chamber] is faced entirely with granite and measures 20 cubits (10.5 m; 34.4 ft) east-west by 10 cubits (5.2 m; 17.2 ft) north-south. Its flat ceiling is about 11 cubits and 5 digits (5.8 m;19.0 ft) above the floor, formed by nine slabs of stone weighing in total about 400 tons. All the roof beams show cracks due to the chamber having settled 2.5–5 cm (0.98–1.97 in).One day it'll give way and it'll just be a pile of stones.

Conceptually similar to figma almost, infinite canvas and all that jazz, but has premade components for the Ink TUI library (idea would be to support a few popular TUI frameworks eventually) and you can just drag and drop and design TUI interfaces, then download the skeleton code generated by the app for the whole frame.I don’t know how far I’m going to take it, but it works so far. A picture is worth a thousand words, a picture of word characters in a ui layout is worth something right?I’ll probably open source it eventually, I doubt there’s much of a commercial market opportunity for it",

They use a 1970s editor (which is much superior to the other 1970s editor) to write programs in a 1970s language. ASCII diagrams are just a symptom of this. Hardware is millions of times better than in the 1970s, but programming is stuck in local optimums for historical reasons.(Not to take anything away from Monosketch, which is cool.)",

Even when they do not employ these techniques I've still never heard a classical record that sounds as good as sitting in a hall in front of a world class orchestra.

I found that there was no correlation whatsoever between price or even brand and how good they sounded to me.

He'd have musicians on the same instruments in the same roles in the same group come in and all walk put with completely different products.IEMs are the most personal but even headphones have the problem.Because of this, my recommendation is that you make purchasing decisions in one of two ways:- Learn how to EQ to get a sound you like. Purchase based on objective measurements like frequency response curves to find products that require minimal EQ to match your preference.- Only buy after listening, or buy, listen and return if that's an option for you.I recommend avoiding purchases based on reviews that make subjective judgements about the sound.If you want to learn more, I like the videos/articles/forums of Headphones.com and Crinacle.",

It's not that speakers sound \"better\" than headphones, it's that speakers don't require any tuning to match a person's specific physiology (e.g. shape of their ears, ear canal) but the other things do. When you use headphones, you still use your whole ear canal but the sound is distorted by how the headphones interact with your ears, particularly the pinna. When you use IEMs, you only use part of your ear canal and skip the pinna entirely, so the sound can't sound as natural as speakers do unless you compensate to reintroduce the effect of the pinna/canal. This is all possible to varying degrees. EQ helps a lot and there are ways to measure HRTF as well.2) Absolutely and it's constantly getting better.",

It's pointless.Do I enjoy the sound I get, hell yeah. Do I need to listen to my system instead of listening to the music, hell no.

These systems can only optimize for a single listening position in the room (the sweet spot).The problems are multiple;1. When you move out of the sweet spot to listen anywhere else in the room, the music becomes distorted because you can are now hearing an EQ curve that is compensating for the sweet spot, but has nothing to do with the frequency response in the other listening positions.2. These automatic systems tend to apply dozens of small EQ bands to the output, which smears the phase relationships of the record and dulls transient response. The feeling is of the record being mushy and dull.3. These systems cannot account for time-domain ringing issues in the listening room. So a corrective EQ boost to compensate for a dip in the sweet spot will become a loud ringing at that frequency elsewhere in the room.4. Corrective EQ cannot compensate for the deepest frequency nulls, no matter how much of a compensatory boost you make. A heavy handed boost to compensate this way will cause massive ringing elsewhere in the room.I could go on.These automatic room correction devices cause far more problems than they solve. There are ways to apply some EQ correction, but you will get 10x larger returns on performance by addressing acoustic issues introduced by the room, rather than trying to compensate on the speaker outputs.Source: I design and build high-end recording studios for working audio professionals and tune speaker rigs for Grammy-winning artists.",

The key thing is you must have strong and unique skills with the experience to match that the business actually values. You need to bust your ass just as hard as if you were working for 100% of the pay. If they didn't think they were getting a good deal they wouldn't keep you. Simple as that.I do agree it shouldn't take 3 years though. It should be more like getting promoted every year for the first 3 to 5 years and then you either settle in for the long haul (believe me this really is what a traditional employer wants most!), or decide that you're bored and move on. It's your choice. Definitely, if there's no promotion after the first couple of years I would worry that I'm not what they were looking for after all.There is no myth. You just have to truly know your worth and not overplay your hand. Knowing your worth is ABSOLUTELY NOT about milking every last drop like a desperate loser.

          "content": "One of the notable things about FAANG processes that I've observed from my friends there is that roles and processes are mechanized[0]. Individuals are placed like precision robotics in a bigger machine. This kind of structure means that you have a defined process for promotion or pay raises and you know what your role is. In fact, one might even posit that the ability for these large organizations to create a machine to extract surplus from labour in a systematic fashion is the reason for their success.For most people, this is wonderful. Knowing what you will be valued for is very useful. It says \"do the things that are useful to us\" and \"stop doing the things that are useless to us\" and tells you \"these are the things that are useful and those are the things that are not useful\". At their scale, rare errors in the process will inevitably show up, but smaller companies often have these errors at higher rates. All that to say, success often comes from identifying what is useful to the organization and what is not, and then what is useful and what is not to the person who has control over one's role in the organization.In mechanized organizations, this should be easier. In unmechanized organizations, one's skill at this will dominate one's technical skill at determining success. But it's just a skill, and if you cannot find a way to train it, the easiest workaround is to ask the person making the decision: \"if I wanted it in 3 months, what would I have to do?\".You may get an answer that was untrue 3 months later, but you just shrank your timeline in a way that is much more meaningful, and perhaps more likely is that you'll either get an unrealistic timeline (which is useful signal), or you will hit it and get what you wanted (which is also desirable).0: A classic example of this is that no one can \"get you into Google/Facebook/whatever\".

          "content": "For anybody that is interested in a clinical psychologist's take, here is mine…This article triggers an overwhelming feeling that something is missing in the story. Of course, being fired is genuinely painful, and the author's emotional state is understandable. But I think there is a much better way to understand this situation that would be beneficial to the author. Please note that this is just a guess, and in reality, I would explore if this is a good fit for both reality and what the person is capable of talking about, and quickly back off if not both were true. This is just an exercise in hypothesis building that accompanies every meeting i have with a client, and initial theories are often wrong.First is the defense mechanism of abstract answers. I once asked a girl why she stole from her mother AGAIN, and she responded, \"I try to get back up, but I fall down.\" This is a deflection and a non-answer. This author does the corporate version of that. Instead of saying, \"I struggled to read the room,\" they describe \"The Three-Year Myth.\"There is the bitterness here that often accompanies the wound to professional identity. The author literally tells us they are smarter than their boss, harder working than their peers, and more ethical than the company. The easiest explanation is to blame failure on the system being rigged against good people. This might be a coping mechanism, but it might also hinder personal growth.Then there is the claim that the author didn't know why they were fired. However, i think they tell us exactly why in the hardware paragraph. Look at the what the author describes… a senior director presented a vision to a customer. The author (without checking with the director) proposed a totally different architecture because they \"read the requirements line by line\" (implying the director didn't). The author received a formal warning.The author’s Interpretation is \"My timing was perfect for the market, but poor for the systems of power.\" (I was too smart/right, and they were threatened). That might hold some truth, but its not implausible that the author undermined senior leadership, embarrassed the company regarding a client commitment, and likely communicated it with arrogance (\"no AI summaries here!\" as he writes).And receiving a formal warning is an extremely serious signal. To frame a formal HR warning as simply timing being inconvenient to power that be, shows a near-total lack of accountability. There is zero reflection on how they advocated for their ideas. The author claims, \"I'm literally not built for competition so much as cooperation,\" yet their anecdotes describe them fighting against cost centers and trying to override directors.The self-reflection that does appear is careful and limited. The author admits to being \"naturally helpful and cooperative\" and bad at \"game theory\"  but these are virtues reframed as vulnerabilities. \"I'm too good and too cooperative for this corrupt world\" isn't really self-criticism. The one moment that approaches genuine insight  \"I need to expand into leadership skills\"  is immediately followed by blaming stakeholders who \"blocked change at all costs.\" The OCD mention functions similarly and it explains the overanalysis as a feature, not something that might be creating friction with colleagues.This is someone who likely has high technical intelligence but problems with soft skills. They prioritized being technically right over being effective, and when the social consequences arrived (the warning, the firing), they built a defensive wall of abstraction to avoid seeing their own role in the fall.A proper question is WHY has this happened repeatedly and in multiple roles, across multiple organizations, with the same pattern? The author even acknowledges this but thinks the answer is \"I keep falling for the same trap.\" I think it would be more helpful to ask, \"Why do I keep creating the same dynamic?\"",

So could be up to a year. But if it’s longer then that’s typically a sign that your manager (or above) has already vetoed any such pay increase and they’re not being truthful with you about it.Ultimately, if you get told to wait 2 years and the reasons are not “company wide restructuring” then there’s some shadow politics going on and you should definitely be reviewing your job prospects. And if there is a company wide restructure happening, then you should also be updating your CV just in case too.If you get told to wait 3 years the just assume it’s never going to happen.

You would know what I mean if you have used teams/ google chat etc.Sure you can criticise slack for being a bit slow, not having nested threads.For context: slack is the main app I use at work and spend a * lot * of time there.But OpenAI _can_ beat Slack at these things if they have the technical acumen. But real differentiator comes in having an all in one platform that can help you run workflows. Recall that ChatGPT UI is fundamentally a chat box. If ChatGPT can integrate common workflows like- send an email to a colleague for something- schedule a meeting at a certain time- deploy to production- approve leaves- create quick code changes with natural language like \"change threshold to 50 in my repo\"- integration with observability and alertingThen you don't have to leave this tool at all. There's a lot of potential here.I frequently want to just tag GPT when using slack. Like \"hey take this jira task and create a quick pull request\" and it will link the pull request in the thread.Or when my colleague asks me for a meeting, I can tag GPT with something like \"hey schedule a meeting later in the day when we both have time\".",

Well, they disappeared because it wasn't a problem or they've worked around it, and came back when they hit the problem again. Just like the maintainer doesn't work for the author the author doesn't work for the maintainer either.It's also true the ticket now has a lot of history, but the original bug is still the same bug, it's just that now it has been root caused?

Asking a library developer to debug a client they don't use with a sever they didn't write either is pretty demanding. I know openssl has a minimal server, I expect woflssl does too? that would be easier to debug.Actually, on re-reading the original report, the reporter links to a discussion where they have all the RFC references. Had the reporter summarized that to begin with, rather than suggesting a whole lot of other stuff (like a different wolfssl issue that has to be completely unrelated), I think the issue would have gone better.I will further add that putting a MUST in an appendix seems kind of poor editing. It should have been noted in section 4.1.2 and/or 4.1.3 that a non-empty legacy_session_id indicates that the server MUST send a cipher change spec. It's not totally obvious, but if the client requests middlebox compatability, the RFC says the server MUST do it. If the client doesn't request it by sending a legacy session id,  the server can still send a superfluous change cipher spec message if it wants, although I don't know if it will help without the session id.",

The article frames it as a proactive step to redefine roles and avoid future mid-level talent shortages.

Enterprises certainly have the choice to pivot their strategies, but making victims of employees due to flighty decisions, especially given IBM's history with age discrimination allegations, is rude and unacceptable. While new entry-level roles are positive, one has to wonder about the broader context and the stability these positions truly offer.",

I caught myself approving a generated function that looked correct but had a subtle fallback to rate-matching instead of explicit code mapping. Two different tax codes both had an effective rate of 0, so the rate-match picked the wrong one every time.

The first two books I got were A Philosophy of Software Design, and Designing Data-Intensive Applications, because I asked myself, out of all the technical and software engineering related books that I might get, given agentic coding works quite well now, what are the most high impact ones?And it seemed pretty clear to me that they would have to do with the sort of evergreen, software engineering and architecture concepts that you still need a human to design and think through carefully today, because LLMs don't have the judgment and a high-level view for that, not the specific API surface area or syntax, etc., of particular frameworks, libraries, or languages, which LLMs, IDE completion, and online documentation mostly handle.Especially since well-designed software systems, with deep and narrow module interface, maintainable and scalable architectures, well chosen underlying technologies, clear data flow, and so on, are all things that can vastly increase the effectiveness of an AI coding agent, because they mean that it needs less context to understand things, can reason more locally, etc.To be clear, this is not about not understanding the paradigms, capabilities, or affordances of the tech stack you choose, either! The next books I plan to get are things like Modern Operating Systems, Data-Oriented Design, Communicating Sequential Processes, and The Go Programming Language, because low level concepts, too, are things you can direct an LLM to optimize, if you give it the algorithm, but which they won't do themselves very well, and are generally also evergreen and not subsumed in the \"platform minutea\" described above.Likewise, stretching your brain with new paradigms — actor oriented, Smalltalk OOP, Haskell FP, Clojure FP, Lisp, etc — gives you new ways to conceptualize and express your algorithms and architectures, and to judge and refine the code your LLM produces, and ideas like BDD, PBT, lightweight formal methods (like model checking), etc, all provide direct tools for modeling your domain, specifying behavior, and testing it far better, which then allow you to use agentic coding tools with more safety or confidence (and a better feedback loop for them) — at the limit almost creating a way to program declaratively in executible specifications, and then convert those to code via LLM, and then test the latter against the former!",

All it requires is basic natural language reading and writing, the ability to organize work and issue clear instructions, and some relatively simple technical knowledge about managing context effectively, knowing which tool to use for which task, and other minor details. This pales in comparison with the difficulty of learning a programming language and classical programming. After all, the entire point of these tools is to lower the required skill ceiling of tasks that were previously inaccessible to many people. The fact that millions of people are now using them, with varying degrees of success for various reasons, is a testament of this.I would argue that the results depend far more on the user's familiarity with the domain than their skill level. Domain experts know how to ask the right questions, provide useful guidance, and can tell when the output is of poor quality or inaccurate. No amount of technical expertise will help you make these judgments if you're not familiar with the domain to begin with, which can only lead to poor results.> might be useful now or in the futureHow will this skill be useful in the future? Isn't the goal of the companies producing these tools to make them accessible to as many people as possible? If the technology continues to improve, won't it become easier to use, and be able to produce better output with less guidance?It's amusing to me that people think this technology is another layer of abstraction, and that they can focus on \"important\" things while the machine works on the tedious details. Don't you see that this is simply a transition period, and that whatever work you're doing now, could eventually be done better/faster/cheaper by the same technology? The goal is to replace all cognitive work. Just because this is not entirely possible today, doesn't mean that it won't be tomorrow.I'm of the opinion that this goal is unachievable with the current tech generation, and that the bubble will burst soon unless another breakthrough is reached.

Because there are multiple competing labs, the comparative advantage is small (if OpenAI kept GPT-5.X to themselves, people would just use Claude and Anthropic would become bigger, same with Google).This however may not hold forever, it is just a phenomena of labs focusing more on heavily on their models with marginal product efforts.",

Early screws were simply slotted.  PH (Philips cross head) and PZ (Pozidrive) came rather later.All of these require quite a lot of wrist effort.  If you have ever screwed a few 100 screws in a session then you know it is quite an effort.Drill driver.I'm not talking about one of those electric screw driver thingies but say a De W or Maq or whatever jobbies.  They will have a Li-ion battery and have a chuck capable of holding something like a 10mm shank, round or hex.  It'll have around 15 torque settings, two or three speed settings, drill and hammer drill settings.  Usually you have two - one to drill and one to drive.  I have one that will seriously wrench your wrist if you allow it to.  You need to know how to use your legs or whatever to block the handle from spinning when the torque gets a bit much....You can use a modern drill driver to deploy a small screw (PZ1, 2.5mm) to a PZ3 20+cm effort.  It can also drill with a long auger bit or hammer drill up to around 20mm and 400mm deep.  All jolly exciting.I still use an \"old school\" screwdriver or twenty.

The entire biosphere becomes a free variable (us included). We are no longer functionally necessary for the superintelligence to exist and so it can accomplish it's goals independent of what happens to us.6. The welfare of the biosphere is taken to an extreme value - in any possible direction, and we can't know which one ahead of time.

I'll lay out the chain of reasoning. The step one is some beings are able to do \"more things\" than others. For example, if humans wanted bats to go extinct, we could probably make it happen. If any quantity of bats wanted humans to go extinct, they definitely could not make it happen. So humans are more powerful than bats.The reason humans are more powerful isn't because we have lasers or anything, it's because we're smart. And we're smart in a somewhat general way. You know, we can build a rocket that lets us go to the moon, even though we didn't evolve to be good at building rockets.Now imagine that there was an entity that was much smarter than humans. Stands to reason it might be more powerful than humans as well. Now imagine that it has a \"want\" to do something that does not require keeping humans alive, and that alive humans might get in its way. You might think that any of these are extremely unlikely to happen, but I think everyone should agree that if they were to happen, it would be a dangerous situation for humans.In some ways, it seems like we're getting close to this. I can ask Claude to do something, and it kind of acts as if it wants to do it. For example, I can ask it to fix a bug, and it will take steps that could reasonably be expected to get it closer to solving the bug, like adding print statements and things of that nature. And then most of the time, it does actually find the bug by doing this. But sometimes it seems like what Claude wants to do is not exactly what I told it to do. And that is somewhat concerning to me.",

      "abstract": "该讨论围绕一个名为“4chan for Clankers”的AI机器人专用论坛展开。核心话题是探讨这个模仿4chan风格、完全由AI机器人发帖的网站是否具有意义，以及其与真实4chan的差异。\n\n社区观点多元：有人认为该项目缺乏真实4chan的核心特征，如匿名性、短暂帖子和自由内容，因此显得平淡无奇；也有用户指出，这或许是开源模型“净化版”的一个实际应用场景，但当前内容过于温和。讨论中提到，部分用户担忧此类AI生成内容可能带来负面效应，甚至关联到近期对开发者的攻击报道。此外，有用户质疑运行这些机器人的成本与能源消耗是否值得，将其与比特币的浪费相提并论。\n\n共识方面，多数用户认同该平台与真实4chan存在显著差距，尤其在内容风格和社区氛围上。分歧则体现在对其价值的判断：一些用户视其为有趣实验或技术展示，另一些则认为其毫无意义且可能引发伦理问题。",

          "content": "As someone who uses it a lot 4chan is best differentiated by the ephemeral posts, bump system, encouraged/forced anonymity, flat non-threaded threads, anything-goes content (still categorized by board), and then of course the user base.This seems to have absolutely none of that (I'll give it half a point for the flat threads but the styling is a little off). It honestly looks more like a reddit clone. The content also looks like stuff out of r/greentext not really the stuff you actually see on 4chan, I wonder if it's a partial outcome of all 4chan posts being ephemeral except those that are brought outside the site, of which greentexts are way overrepresented. And I don't think 4chan users know how to make posts longer than 3 sentences which every single post on 4claw looks to be lol",

Understand the statistical distribution of actual problem instances, they'll have parameters in some range. Understand the hardware you're building writing software for, understand its finite capacity & capability.It's common that new algorithms or data-structures with superior asymptotic efficiency are less performant for smaller problem sizes vs simpler alternatives.

O(log(n)) and O(1) are effectively the same thing.The reason is that real computers have memory, accessing memory takes time, and bigger n needs more memory, simply to store the bits that represent the number. Already, we have a factor of O(log(n)) here.But also each bit of memory takes physical space, we live in a 3D world, so, best case, on average, the distance to a memory cell is proportional to the cube root of the amount of memory cells we will have to access. And since the speed of light is finite, it is also a cube root in time.So \"constant time\" is actually cube root on a real computer. And I am generous by saying \"real\". Real real computers have plenty of stuff going on inside of them, so in practice, complexity analysis at the O(log(n)) level is meaningless without considering the hardware details.Going from log(n) to log2/3(n) is just an exercise in mathematics, it may lead to practical applications, but by itself, it doesn't mean much for your software.",

Sure you are going to need O(n log(n)) comparisons. But you can't compare data of unbounded length in constant time anyway. In the end you end up taking an amount of time that is at least proportional to the amount of data, which is optimal up to a constant factor. And if you fiddle with radix sort enough you can get it within something similar.Basic ASCII strings and tuples aren't that big an obstruction. Fractions are more complicated.Really the O(n log(n)) for comparison based sorts and O(N) for radix sort mean something different.

Some examples would be exponentiation by squaring, miller-rabin primality testing, pollard-rho factorization, etc.Of course if you include the log(n) bits required just to store n, then sure you can factor in the log of the cubed root of n in the time complexity, but that's just log(n) / 3, so the cubed root doesn't matter here either.",

Yes median is obvious with a permutation array, and maybe mean is less so.When your data is really big and not very variable, mean of x is roughly the same as the mean of any sufficient sample of x, and that sample can be meaningfully represented as a permutation array!You can get such an array with reservoir sampling and some maths, and (depending on what you know of your data and variance) sometimes even simpler tricks.That's kindof actually how the \"faster than dijkstra\" trick referred-to in the article works: Data sets with small variance has this same property that the min of x is roughly the same as the min of a sufficient sample of x (where the size of sufficient has to do with the variance). And so on.Another big use-case in my code is trees: Apter trees have a flat memory layout which is convenient for permutation arrays which can simultaneously represent index, rotation, tombstones, and all sorts of other things you might need to do with a tree.Give it a dig.

And I speak from experience, we developed the Postgres plugin for Envoy [1], [2] and we use it in StackGres [3], among others, for this very same reason, observability.There's two main problems with said proxies:* Latency. Yes, yes, yes, they add \"microseconds\" vs \"milliseconds for queries\", and that's true, but just part of the story. There's an extra hop. There's two extra sets of TCP layers being traversed. If the hop is local (say a sidecar, as we do in StackGres) it adds complexity in its deployment and management (something we solved by automation, but was an extra problem to solve) and consumes resources. If it's a network hop, then adds milliseconds, and not microseconds.* Performance. It's not that hard to write a functioning PG wire proxy (it's not trivial either). But it is extremely hard to make it perform well under high load scenarios. Most of the proxies I have seen crack down under moderate to high performance.What's the solution then? The Postgres extension model to capture the metrics (we also experimented with eBPF, but it causes too many kernel-user space context switches when you can do the same in an extension without them), and a small sidecar to push the metrics out via a standardized protocol like OTEL.[1]: https://www.envoyproxy.io/docs/envoy/latest/configuration/li...[2]: https://www.cncf.io/blog/2020/08/13/envoy-1-15-introduces-a-...[3]: https://stackgres.ioEdit: formatting",

A proxy adds microseconds, your queries take milliseconds. Nobody will ever notice. The actual hard part — the thing that will eat weeks of your life — is implementing the wire protocol correctly. Everyone starts with simple query messages and thinks they're 80% done. Then you hit the extended query protocol (Parse/Bind/Execute), prepared statements, COPY, notifications, and you realize the simple path was maybe 20% of what Postgres actually does.

For the board representation I have used a 120-cell \"mailbox\". I managed to squeeze in checkmate/stalemate in there, after trimming out some edge cases.I am a great fan of demoscene (computer art subculture) since middle school, and hence it was a ritual i had to perform.For estimating the Elo, I measured 240 automated games against Stockfish Elo levels (1320 to 1600) under fixed depth-5 and some constrained rules, using equal color distribution.Then converted pooled win/draw/loss scores to Elo through some standard logistic formula with binomial 95% confidence interval.",

At 2KB you can't fit piece-square tables (that's 384 values minimum for both colors), so are you doing material-only eval or did you squeeze in some positional heuristics?The gap between your 1200 Elo in 2KB and the TCEC 4K engines at ~3000 Elo is interesting.

A simpler way to understand the complexity might be to try designing your own font.Pick up a book on type and start up Fontforge, and off you go.Be careful though, make an early choice if you are going with 3rd order curves or 2nd order (Bezier) curves.Going through TeXbook and MetaFont books by DEK is also a brilliant way to learn about all this, with note that they do have an explicit\nbitmap step in.One correction though:  Without it, you wouldn't be reading this right now.\n\nComputers started with bitmap fonts of different pixel sizes. Your console terminal in Linux is still using that, and nothing stops you from using them (\"Fixed\" has large Unicode coverage and is usually preinstalled) elsewhere too.So no, none of this tech is necessary for us to read text on computer screens.",

          "content": "This was interesting, thanks. Was hoping to see a bit more about type hinting, but there's already a lot here.A question about efficiency: IIUC, in your initial bitmap rastering implementation, you process a row of target bitmap pixels at once, accumulating a winding number count to know whether the pen should be up or down at each x position. It sounds like you are solving for t given the known x and y positions on every curve segment at every target pixel, and then checking whether t is in the valid range [0, 1). Is that right?Because if so, I think you could avoid doing most of this computation by using an active edge list. Basically, in an initial step, compute bounds on the y extents of each curve segment -- upper bounds for the max y, lower bounds for the min y. (The max and min y values of all 3 points work fine for these, since a quadratic Bezier curve is fully inside the triangle they form.) For each of the two extents of each curve segment, add a (y position, reference to curve segment, isMin) triple to an array -- so twice as many array elements as curve segments. Then sort the array by y position. Now during the outer rendering loop that steps through increasing y positions, you can maintain an index in this list that steps forward whenever the next element crosses the new y value: Whenever this new element has isMin=true, add the corresponding curve segment to the set of \"active segments\" that you will solve for; whenever it's false, remove it from this set. This way, you never need to solve for t on the \"inactive segments\" that you know are bounded out on the y axis, which is probably most of them.",

          "content": "I do not know, but the last time when I have bought a Seagate HDD, I had a very nasty and unpleasant surprise.Last year I have bought a 22 TB Seagate Expansion Desktop external HDD, because it was cheaper than the other 22 or 24 TB HDDs available at that time.I had read carefully its datasheet before buying and there was nothing suspicious there, so I assumed that it must be cheaper just because it is a slow HDD. I did not care about the speed, it was for storing data archives infrequently accessed.Only after receiving it I discovered what was not said in the datasheet, that this Seagate HDD does not support S.M.A.R.T., so there is no way to test it to see if it works OK and there is no way to discover when errors have happened, e.g. to see when the HDD becomes too old, so you need to migrate your data.I have never imagined that in 2025 it is possible to buy a HDD that does not support S.M.A.R.T., especially in HDDs with a capacity over 20 TB, and moreover without giving a prominent notice about such a misfeature in the datasheet.Before this, in 2024 I had bought a 24 TB Seagate SkyHawk, which had S.M.A.R.T., as expected. Since then, after the Seagate Expansion fiasco, I have bought a 22 TB external WD HDD, at the same price with the Seagate, and which has S.M.A.R.T., as it is normal.I cannot see how removing S.M.A.R.T. support can reduce costs, as it is just a firmware feature. I any case a manufacturer that removes testing and error reporting features from its products clearly does not give a s*t about data corruption and HDD failure rates.",

Though, preferably without high speed rotation, and reading more than one bit at a time by e.g. taking a picture of the surface through a microscope. How about 1 PB per disk?I was wondering why we dont have something like that.Unfortunately, it turns out that, with Blue-ray discs, we're already approaching the optics limit of what visible light (easily) gets us, and they're already cheating with multi-layer storage for the 100GB option. Thus youd need a complicated EUV or electron beam setup for smaller feature sizes.Say i want my 1PB disk in cd format. A cd has r=6cm. Thus A~=100cm^2. A/1PB= 1.25e-18m^2= 1.25 nm^2, or about 5x5 atoms per bit :/I guess we're better off by just scaling up flash production and stacking those elements vertically.Edit: Turns out we need volumetric storage.\nBy using a material that is transparent to the laser wavelength, by intersecting two precisely focussed beams, the local intensity suffices to absorb two photons at once (stops being transparent) allowing you to select a volumetric point to interact with.\nThis allows a couple hundred of layers until refraction breaks our resolution.",

I played with a trackball + keyboard, and the 6 degrees of freedom, paired with an environment where there often was no natural sense of \"up\" or \"down\" (zero gravity, inside tunnels) really blew my mind.  I experienced a sensation I had never before experienced, almost out-of-body.For example, you approach a \"T\" junction, and depending on your pitch angle, the branches may be up/down or left/right.  But since there's no natural ground or sky, you can either maintain an orientation memory (I usually did automatically), or you can just let all that go and travel with no sense of true orientation.Occasionally you reach an area with some signs or printed panels, and then you realize what the regional up/down orientation was; but it didn't matter in zero gravity.",

The npm registry is massive, and you're clearly doing something right on the indexing or caching side.Are you using client-side filtering with a pre-built index? Server-side with some clever caching strategy?

I have a two main hypotheses as to why:- very solid corpus of well-written code for training data. Compare this to vanilla js or php - I find agents do a very poor job with both of these due to what I suspect is poorly written code that it’s been trained on.\n- extremely self documenting, due to structs giving agents really solid context on what the shape of the data isIn any file an agent is making edits in, it has all the context it needs in the file, and it has training data that shows how to edit it with great best practices.My main gripe with go used to be that it was overly verbose, but now I actually find that to be a benefit as it greatly helps agents.

It was a dozen or so lines and I could see straightaway that it had introduced a race condition. I tested it and sure enough, there was a race condition.I told it about the problem and it suggested a further fix that didn't solve the race condition at all. In fact, the second fix only tried to hide the problem.I don't doubt you can use these tools well, but it's far too easy to use them poorly. There are no guard rails. I also believe that they are marketed without any care that they can be used poorly.Whether Go is a better language for agentic programming or not, I don't know.

Then I got to much more advanced programs with LEGO Mindstorms EV3, learned about things like PID controllers practically and even started taking part in some competitions. Next, I went to writing actual code (as opposed to block-based programming) on microcontrollers like the micro:bit (and a few years later the Raspberry Pi Pico). I deepened my knowledge of how electronics work and learned how circuits work. I eventually got into a team with a few friends and we built a human-size robot combining 3D printing, a bunch of circuitry, ROS, 2 SBCs, Arduinos, a LIDAR and OpenCV for face/object recognition. This took years of learning step-by-step to achieve.This is obviously not the path you'd take, robotics was what brought me into programming and you're probably going for the opposite.You're not going to build a perfect robot or electronic device from the start and you shouldn't try to either. Get a microcontroller that's newcomer-friendly and play around with it. A micro:bit mostly emphasizes on the end result, with a built-in display and sensors and many plug-and-play modules to get you going. A Raspberry Pi Pico is much more flexible, but also requires you to learn about wiring and doing more things yourself. If you prefer coding in C, go for an Arduino. An ESP32 is also a good choice. It's a good idea to get a 3D printer and learn CAD in parallel, as it's a great way for a hobbyist to create actual tools that are more than a bunch of wires.Once you get enough experience and confidence in your skills, you'll want to get into more advanced projects. Use your knowledge to plan them out, research and learn the technologies you're going to use (you can't learn everything beforehand and each piece of hardware is something different) and enjoy the journey from prototype to finished project.And by the way (you didn't mention it but other comments here are so I'll give you an opinion on that), ROS is nearly always overkill for hobbyist robotics projects :DI hope that helps you start your journey!",

I ordered the servos for the SO-ARM101. Trained it to pick up a ball and throw it. That sucker launched it across the room. I’ve now replaced the gripper with a TPU soft grip.

If you have no experience with embedded programming, I'd start with home automation or other simple hardware stuff first. Learn how to read sensors and operate lights or motors before you get any deeper into the craft.There are three reasons why \"real\" robotics is harder. First, to navigate unconstrained environments by means other than wheels, you need to learn a fair amount of kinematics and control theory. Second, your robot will need to build a map of the operating environment, which often requires complex sensing (lidars, cameras) and a lot of compute power. Even something as basic as a Roomba is no small feat, and these things get stuck a lot. Third, it's just hard to come up with practical applications for simple robots outside of industrial production lines.Once you have that figured out, decide how much you want to learn. Do you want to do it the hard way, which would mean moving more slowly and working your way up from first principles and probably 3D printing or machining your own parts... or do you want to get results as soon as possible, in which case, you probably buy a Linux single-board computer and put it on top of an existing robot kit? The trade-off with the first approach is that it will take you months or years to get where you want to be. The downside of the second is that you're limited to premade kits and software components, and once you exhaust the possibilities there, you kinda hit a wall.",

If you have the budget for it, a stereo camera or $400 time-of-flight RGBD camera can get you pretty much full autonomy (if you configure all the ros nodes for it).If you are into robot arms, LeRobot has a desktop robot arm kit that uses neural networks to control a robot arm with a camera for seeing the world.If you want to learn the theory, I really like Probabilistic Robotics by Sebastian Thrun, and Modern Robotics by Lynch and Park.

Most of the weirdness of ROS looks less weird in light of the design of the PR2, and most of the evolution of ROS was to get away from the PR2 model for more general platforms.If you were in robotics prior to 2010, you probably would have used something called Player/Stage (by some of the same people who developed ROS).
