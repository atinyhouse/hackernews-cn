      "content_cn": "演讲：https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/da/speech...",
      "abstract": "该讨论围绕欧盟拟推出的新型泛欧法律实体EU–INC展开。核心话题是这一实体能否简化欧盟内公司注册和运营流程，提升商业竞争力。多数用户认同当前欧盟各国公司注册程序繁琐且成本高昂，特别是德国等国的公证要求备受诟病，因此普遍期待新实体能降低创业门槛。\n\n争议点主要集中在实施层面。有用户担心官僚体系可能扭曲“快速注册”的初衷，将其变为“材料齐全后的快速注册”；税收安排也成为焦点，有人质疑各国税收权益如何协调。另有用户指出类似机制（如Societas Europaea）已存在但效果有限，同时跨境资本市场监管仍面临挑战。讨论中德国、奥地利等国的公证制度被多次批评为低效且昂贵，而支持者则认为新实体能打破成员国间的制度壁垒，真正促进跨境创业和投资。",

Huge amount of risk and cost on founders and a huge distraction from running a business.I think that EU-Inc _could_ be an improvement, but it needs to avoid the committee laundry list of ideas/requirements/form fields that plagues the EU startup ecosystem. My worry is that the end result will require notarized declarations of honour, financial plans stretching decades into the future, 30 page business plan documents, reams of corporate governance documents, and tons of other nonsense to protect against the perceived risk that someone who failed at starting a business once fails a second time.There needs to be UX requirements on the process from day one against which the end result is judged. (E.g. \"a company should be able to register in x days\", \"a complete application should be no longer than y pages\", \"application costs should be less than z euros\").",

It's a bigger deal than it might seem.You'd be surprised at some of the weird things that can happen in the current systems in the EU if you try to do business across borders.Like:  your company suddenly automatically becoming deregistered, or you might get a sudden huge tax bill, or you might even inadvertently get charged with fraud.Hasn't happened so far knock on wood, but it's a lot more work to stay on the light side than you'd really like.This is all because the national systems still sort of assume that you'll live and work and stay inside one EU country. You end up constantly fitting square administrative pegs into regulatory round holes.A lot of the EU's promise is actually theoretical without a proper pan european legal entity.",

Continuing to block progress here only proves that the EU is good at making promises on paper but fails to deliver real change.The reason this \"28th regime\" actually works—and bypasses the previous vetos — is that it’s optional. It doesn’t try to force Germany to change its local GmbH laws or kill the notary system overnight. Instead, it creates a parallel, voluntary path. Berlin doesn't have to give up its red tape for local shops, but they have to let a \"Unified European Company\" exist alongside them.If we let national pride or local bureaucracy stop this again, we are essentially telling our best founders to leave for the US. Let’s stop protecting red tape and start protecting our future.",

So that business can operate across Member States much more easily. Our entrepreneurs, the innovative companies, will be able to register a company in any Member State within 48 hours – fully online. They will enjoy the same capital regime all across the EU. Ultimately, we need a system where companies can do business and raise financing seamlessly across Europe – just as easily as in uniform markets like the US or China. If we get this right – and if we move fast enough – this will not only help EU companies grow. But it will attract investment from across the world.> Which brings me to the second focus – investment and capital. We are now building the Savings and Investment Union. We need a large-scale, deep and liquid capital market that attracts a wide range of investors. This will allow businesses to find the funding they need – including equity – at lower cost here in Europe. We have made proposals on market integration and supervision to ensure our financial market is more integrated. This covers trading, post-trading, and asset management – as well as driving innovation and making our supervisory framework more efficient. This will help ensure that capital flows where it is needed – to scaleups, to SMEs, to innovation, to industry.> Third priority: building an interconnected and affordable energy market – a true energy union. Energy is a chokepoint – for both companies and households. Just look at the dispersion of prices across European electricity hubs. Europe needs an energy blueprint that pulls together all the parts. This is our Affordable Energy Action Plan. For example, we are investing massively in our energy security and independence, with interconnectors and grids – this is for the homegrown energies that we are trying to promote as much as possible, nuclear and renewables. To bring down prices and cut dependencies. To put an end to price volatility, manipulation and supply shock. But we now need to speed up this transition. Because homegrown, reliable, resilient and cheaper energy will drive our economic growth, deliver for Europeans and secure our independence.",

Sure, you can report and actually settle it to a single national authority (and then that national process separately).Unless a country will actually defer parts of its company and tax law to Brussels, for companies present in that country - then I just don't really see what this brings over just starting a limited company in another state (even outside of the EU) - as you'll still have to follow national law in the country where you're resident anyway, which could be anything.(e.g. I start an Estonian OU with E residency, I live in Finland.

A Berlin-based \"EU-Inc\" still pays full taxes (Körperschaftsteuer, Gewerbesteuer, etc.) to the local Finanzamt. It isn't a disembodied tax haven - it just standardizes the legal wrapper.You are right that this threatens the status quo, though. If this works, founders based in Germany will likely abandon the GmbH. That will require swallowing some national pride and admitting that the current system is simply a less efficient, less competitive legal form for high-growth companies.One thing I think is also worth mentioning are labor rights. I am not arguing against the German model of employee protection. Mitbestimmung could be viewed as a good thing, even if it will mean less power to the VC and / or founders. And frankly, I don't care if the consensus forces strict, German-style Mitbestimmung on the EU-Inc. Stricter form of EU-INC is still vastly better than nothing at all.Asianometry has a great video on the labor rights in germany btw - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K0teMtLT9XI).",

You can't opt out, it's part of the human condition.Gambling refers to taking on risk for the feeling it brings.  The fact that humans can gamble reveals a quirk of human neurology.\nIf we evolved to be more rational, then the phenomenon probably wouldn't exist.\nWe know the feeling is valuable (to gamblers) because they are willing to place negative EV bets to bring about the feeling.Anytime people criticize betting, it looks to me like some kind of utopian scheme, where everyone can have everything without risk.",

Other people are completely unaware of this deal.Having fire insurance and burning your car is in most jurisdictions illegal. Yes, you should be paid if your car is burned, but if you do it intentionally, you are obviously increasing the chances of getting paid, unless of course the insurance company finds out you did it.\nAnd so on.I don't see why these situations would be illegal and, say, betting against the survival of a regime when you're actually working against it, would be legal.Things are even harder if you coordinate multiple people. For example, let's say 100 people bet that there will be a riot in town X by the end of the year. X is normally a quiet town so most people bet against. These 100 people bet this will happen 10 minutes before actually starting a riot themselves. Yes, someone could observe last minute trends and might predict reality, but last minute or huge bets are not necessarily true - someone could bet on random things for a variety of reasons.

From time to time there was a revival of hope caused by an apparent revival of business; but this revival of business was at last seen to be caused more and more by the desire of far-seeing and cunning men of affairs to exchange paper money for objects of permanent value.  As to the people at large, the classes living on fixed incomes and small salaries felt the pressure first, as soon as the purchasing power of their fixed incomes was reduced. Soon the great class living on wages felt it even more sadly.Prices of the necessities of life increased: merchants were obliged to increase them, not only to cover depreciation of their merchandise, but also to cover their risk of loss from fluctuation; and, while the prices of products thus rose, wages, which had at first gone up under the general stimulus, lagged behind. Under the universal doubt and discouragement, commerce and manufactures were checked or destroyed. As a consequence the demand for labor was diminished; laboring men were thrown out of employment, and, under the operation of the simplest law of supply and demand, the price of labor--the daily wages of the laboring class--went down until, at a time when prices of food, clothing and various articles of consumption were enormous, wages were nearly as low as at the time preceding the first issue of irredeemable currency.\"",

For example, in prediction markets, some forms of insider trading are considered somewhat desirable - essentially, it monetizes insiders leaking inside information.Other forms of insider trading can be problematic: What if someone (could be an individual or even an uncoordinated group) bets millions of dollars on you not doing X, in the hopes of you taking the opposite bet and doing X?The most extreme that I've seen presented so far are markets where people can predict the death date of a person. On the surface, that just seems like a morbid bet. Once you consider the above form of insider trading, you realize that this can act as a reward for someone who can accurately predict the death date of said person, for example because they're making the counter-trade from a phone next to a high-powered rifle on the rooftop across the street - and like in the bribe example above, the people on the \"losing\" side of the bet might not mind too much. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assassination_market",

Nobody is upset about people dealing with the natural risk of day-to-day life; the problem is that people are now being incentivized to take on additional risk (beyond the day-to-day) which they are poorly equipped to reason about. The systems governing the dynamics of geopolitical events (or other things you can estimate in a betting market) are staggeringly complex, and assigning credences to them is an epistemological nightmare that even the most seasoned experts struggled to do reliably.

For example, in my mind, betting on whether you will win a game of chess is not gambling. On the other hand, if you cannot influence the outcome in your favour through skill, then it is gambling. Roulette is generally a good example of this (with the caveat that in some very specific circumstances it's possible to beat with skill).If we're limiting the definition to merely risk-taking (you might win or you might lose) without factoring in skill, then virtually everything in life becomes gambling. For example, you gamble when you deposit money in the bank because it might go bust.There's also the legal definition, in which case it's just a matter of checking whether the jurisdiction you are in considers the activity to be gambling or not.",

New technologies are treated  as guilty until proven innocent, because that is a more engaging narrative for readers. So in this case, those covering this stuff immediately latch onto the rich get richer, insider trading viewpoint, and that gets reported without any analysis of why that might actually be desirable.Second, prediction markets, in trying to become broadly accessible to \"normal\" people and desiring liquidity, need a marketing strategy that is understandable. They can't put out a Robin Hanson article as marketing material. So they market by appealing to something people do already understand, which is gambling. The public has this idea now of prediction markets as a way to make money, not as a tool for learning information. So the default perspective on insider trading is now one of unfairness: somebody used their privileged position to make money. The correct perspective is, in fact, that prediction markets are providing users with value by eliciting information from those insiders, information that the public would not otherwise have.

It's one thing to crowd-source knowledge in a steady, homogenous way.

Insider trading is quite different from a Hayek-style price signalling, and it's the same here.

They were delighted at the apparent advance in the value of the goods upon their shelves.

New issues only increased the evil; capitalists were all the more reluctant to embark their money on such a sea of doubt. Workmen of all sorts were more and more thrown out of employment.  Issue after issue of currency came; but no relief resulted save a momentary stimulus, which aggravated the disease. The most ingenious evasions of natural laws in finance which the most subtle theorists could contrive were tried--all in vain; the most brilliant substitutes for those laws were tried; \"self-regulating\" schemes, \"interconverting\" schemes--all equally vain.  All thoughtful men had lost confidence.  All men were waiting; stagnation became worse and worse. At last came the collapse and then a return, by a fearful shock, to a state of things which presented something like certainty of remuneration to capital and labor. Then, and not till then, came the beginning of a new era of prosperity.Just as dependent on the law of cause and effect was the moral development. Out of the inflation of prices grew a speculating class; and, in the complete uncertainty as to the future, all business became a game of chance, and all business men, gamblers. In city centers came a quick growth of stock-jobbers and speculators; and these set a debasing fashion in business which spread to the remotest parts of the country. Instead of satisfaction with legitimate profits, came a passion for inordinate gains. Then, too, as values became more and more uncertain, there was no longer any motive for care or economy, but every motive for immediate expenditure and present enjoyment.

I was arbitraging this market for the whole year on any \"new\" hillary news, so paid very close attention to the discussion circles happening around it - I checked in after the market closed and many of the genuine \"YES\" people putting up as much money as they were able to concluded PredictIt was incorrect and that Hillary was still the \"phantom\" nominee. It would not at all surprise me if a few of them still believe she actually ran for president. They probably should have closed the market several months before, but they kept it open. If they had closed it at any reasonable point beforehand a huge chunk of the \"YES\" market would have lost their minds.People are goofy and prone to conspiratorial thinking.

For example, in blackjack you can limit your losses by following a basic strategy, which is a 2x2 matrix with rows containing the value of your hand and columns containing the open dealer card.If you can obtain an edge through a skill component (card counting in blackjack), some people wouldn't call this gambling anymore, but I would still call it gambling myself. Someone doing this for a living is a professional gambler.What for me would be a sensible definition is that a bet/gamble has no other goals. Putting money in the bank/investing in a stock reallocates capital, which can be invested by someone. The fact that it is a risk-taking endeavor is merely a side effect. I would say the same goes for selling/buying insurance for your car.So for me, the difference between betting and putting money in the bank/investing is that the primary goal is something different than the risk-taking activity.",

While men set such fashions in private and official business, women set fashions of extravagance in dress and living that added to the incentives to corruption.

Patriotism was eaten out by cynicism.Thus was the history of France logically developed in obedience to natural laws; such has, to a greater or less degree, always been the result of irredeemable paper, created according to the whim or interest of legislative assemblies rather than based upon standards of value permanent in their nature and agreed upon throughout the entire world.

It brought on these the same destruction which would come to a Hollander opening the dykes of the sea to irrigate his garden in a dry summer.

While NAT incidently does something similar to a firewall, it is not a security feature. NAT must track any outgoing network connection in order to understand where to route incoming packets. If a packet it not a reply to an established connection, it is dropped. Otherwise the NAT must look up who opened the connection. A NAT can only work if stateful.In a routable connection, ALL of that can be based on the static routing table.Imagine a university with 10,000 computer, all of them having opened maybe 100 concurrent connections. The NAT must track every single connection and do a lookup for every packet.In a routable network, it just looks up the destination IP in the packet and sends it to the next hop for the destination IP.All while hopefully a firewall is in front of it.So why would you want to reintroduce NAT to IPv6, when both issues are efficiently solved already?",

Some *BSD-based NAT implementations are this way.Endpoint-independent _filtering_ is only a good idea for CGNAT implementations. Having an EIM/EIF NAT/firewall setup without additional firewalling makes it possible and easy for devices to run public-facing UDP-based servers without anyone's knowledge. With EIM/EIF, once you create a NAT mapping, so long as you send out periodic keepalives, _any_ IP address with _any_ source port can make unsolicited connections to a server that the NAT mapping points to.

With IPv4 NAT it is more likely that the router will break in such a way that I won't be able to access the internet.  Having NAT break in such a way that it accidentally port forwards all incoming connection attempts to my laptop sitting behind it is not a likely bug or failure mode.  If it does happen, it would likely only happen to a single machine sitting behind it.OTOH, if my laptop and every other machine on my local subnet has a public IPv6 address on it, then I'm trusting that consumer grade router to never break in such a way that the firewall default allows all for some reason--opening up every single machine on my local subnet and every single listening port.  A default deny flipping to a default allow is absolutely the kind of security bug that really happens and would keep me awake at night.  And even if I don't go messing around with it and screw it up myself, there's always the possibility that a software bug in a firmware upgrade causes the problem.I'd like to know what the solution to this is, other than blind trust in the router/firewall manufacturer or setting up your own external monitoring (and testing that monitoring periodically).Instead of just screaming about how \"NAT ISN'T SECURITY\" over and over, I'd like someone to just explain how to mitigate the security concerns of firewall rulesets--when so very many of us have seen firewall rulesets be misconfigured by \"professionals\" at our $DAYJOBs.  Just telling me that every IPv6 router should have default deny rules and nobody would be that incompetent to sell a router that wouldn't be that insecure doesn't give me warm fuzzies.I don't necessarily trust NAT more, but a random port forward rule for all ports appearing against a given target host behind it is going to be a much more unusual kind of bug than just having a default firewall rule flipped to allow.",

Customary units are different in that there are awkward numbers baked into the system.  e.g. 5280 feet in a mile.  128 ounces in a gallon.3. \"It's too much trouble to change.\"  You're already using metric units.  U.S. customary units have, metrologically, been defined in terms of metric units since the Mendenhall order of 1893[1].  i.e. A meter is defined in terms of how far light can travel in a period of time defined by a hyperfine transition frequency of Caesium.  If you needed to know exactly how long a meter is for a very precise measurement, a reference meter could be produced in a lab by aliens who have no idea what a meter is by using this definition.  No such definition exists for a foot or yard.  Nobody maintains physical reference yards (the old-school method) anymore.    If you want those aliens to measure out a yard precisely, you tell them how to measure out a meter and then tell them 1 yard = 0.9144 m.[1]https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mendenhall_Order",

Instead of being fitted from the outside they were changed to being fitted from the inside.When fitted from the outside the job of the fasteners is to keep the cabin pressure from blowing the window out when the plane is high up and the outside pressure is low. When the plane is on the ground gravity will keep the window in place and the fastener isn't doing much.Botch installing the fasteners and you don't find out about until the window blows out at high altitude, like on that flight.When fitted from the inside the job of the fasteners is to keep the window from falling in due to gravity when the plane is on the ground or at low altitude. At higher altitudes the cabin pressure pushes the window firmly into the frame and the fasteners aren't doing much.Botch installing the fasteners and the window falls in on the ground or at low altitude which is a lot easier to deal with then a window blowing out at high altitude.",

It's really baffling to me that THIS is the one that most people talking about metric superiority cling to.  Where metric shines is when you talk about subunits like mg vs g vs kg.  You don't do that with temperature almost ever.  So so what if water boils at 212F vs 100C?  Pinning 100 at the boiling point of pure water at standard atmospheric pressure is every bit as arbitrary as Fs original 100F pin to the internal body temperature of a horse.Otherwise I agree with you.  I just wish stronger arguments would be made.  Measuring distance, speed, weight, volume in metric makes a lot more sense and is more intuitive.  It's easy to relate 300mL to 1L. or 1cm to 1m to 1km.  And that is where most of the value of metric comes from.  The fact that we basically never think in terms of kC or mC is why using temperature is very weak.",

The expected answer is usually that they're the same weight, because there is no difference in weight between the two things that both weigh a pound. The problem is that, in the USA, a pound of feathers is measured with the avoirdupois pound, while a pound of gold is measured in troy pounds.  The troy pound is lighter than the avoirdupois pound, so the answer is that a pound of feathers is heavier.While a  troy ounce is heavier than the avoirdupois ounce, and the grain unit is equal in both.

For things where how much you can fit in a given volume varies quite a bit depending on how you pack it the FDA requires that the metric units on the label be mass units, and that nutritional information is for that amount of mass of the thing.The actual amount of flour in a cup of flour for example can vary quite a bit depending on how much air got in when you poured it. If the label says it is 110 calories for 1/4 cup (30g) and you want to actually use 440 calories of flour in something you should measure out 120g rather than 1 cup.For things like milk 1 cup is going to have the same amount of milk no matter how you pour it, so they use volume measurement for both customary and metric.",

Liters aren't uncommon, and ml<->gram equivalence for water is well-known. Traditional kitchen volumes probably wouldn't be displaced because metric has no answer for those in first place.Temperature is where metric will fail to gain adoption because Celsius totally sucks unless your daily life consists only of boiling or freezing water at sea level.

For example, \"How long is that wall?\" or \"How far is it from here to the post office?\" or \"How heavy is this paperweight?\". People who'd grown up using customary were significantly more accurate in their guesses.The study surmised it was because those units had been developed over millennia to be useful at human scales. When eyeballing the length of a wall, centimeters are too granular and meters are to course, but feet are \"just right\". You might guess a wall is 12 feet long, and be pretty close, but 3 or 4 meters aren't that accurate, and nobody really guesses 3.5 meters.Same with temperature. 0 - 100°F is about all we as humans will usually experience, so its very convenient when talking about the weather or HVAC thermostats.They are worse when doing math or conversions, and while that's annoying for scientists and engineers, in most people's everyday lives it comes up so infrequently it doesn't really matter. If something is less than a mile, you don't suddenly convert to feet and do math, you just say \"about a half mile\".Personally, I do woodworking (which in the US is always imperial) and 3d-printing (which is always metric), and often combine the two. When doing woodworking or carpentry, its nice that a foot is evenly divisible by 3 or 6, or that half of 3/8ths of an inch is 3/16ths.",

Power is the product of voltage and current or torque and speed - if you use the SI units no conversion required. Inertia was confusing as hell, some vendors specified it in MOISS, or milli-ounce-inches-seconds-squared, not only involving different unit but you can also get balled up in the mass vs force confusions.Converting a drawing from one system to the other perfectly is practically impossible. Conversions can't always be exact and because tolerances are commonly specified in round numbers within a system.In my garage I still have both metric and Reagan-unit tools. Even though my cars, even the American ones have been metric since the '80s, I have to have the other tools for other household things like the garage doors!And then there's the tire size abomination - an unholy union - a 255R70-14 is 255 mm wide at the bulge, the sidewall height is 70% of that, and the rim diameter is 14 inches.I agree that 1 °C is too big a step when dealing with thermostats but that's easily solved by using 0.5 °C resolution.",

If any of you have actually got it to work, could you share (in detail) how you did it?By \"getting it to work\" I mean:\n * creating more value than technical debt, and\n * producing code that’s structurally sound enough for someone responsible for the architecture to sign off on.Lately I’ve seen a push toward minimal or nonexistent code review, with the claim that we should move from “validating architecture” to “validating behavior.” In practice, this seems to mean: don’t look at the code; if tests and CI pass, ship it. I can’t see how this holds up long-term. My expectation is that you end up with \"spaghetti\" code that works on the happy path but accumulates subtle, hard-to-debug failures over time.When I tried using Codex on my existing codebases, with or without guardrails, half of my time went into fixing the subtle mistakes it made or the duplication it introduced.Last weekend I tried building an iOS app for pet feeding reminders from scratch. I instructed Codex to research and propose an architectural blueprint for SwiftUI first. Then, I worked with it to write a spec describing what should be implemented and how.The first implementation pass was surprisingly good, although it had a number of bugs. Things went downhill fast, however. I spent the rest of my weekend getting Codex to make things work, fix bugs without introducing new ones, and research best practices instead of making stuff up. Although I made it record new guidelines and guardrails as I found them, things didn't improve. In the end I just gave up.I personally can't accept shipping unreviewed code. It feels wrong. The product has to work, but the code must also be high-quality.",

I wanted this tool to be in JS because of some additional minor logic which would be a hassle to implement in pure bash.2) I needed a simple C wrapper to parallelize /usr/bin/codesign over cores. Split list of binaries in batches and run X parallel codesigns over a batch.Arguably, both tools are junior-level tasks.I have used Claude Code and Opus 4.5. I have used AskUserTool to interview me and create a detailed SPEC.md. I manually reviewed and edited the final spec. I then used the same model to create the tool according to that very detailed spec.The first tool, the dylib consolidation one, was broken horrendously. I did recurse into subdirs where no folder structure is expected or needed and did not recurse into folders where it was needed. It created a lot of in-memory structures which were never read. Unused parameters in functions. Unused functions. Incredible, illogical code that is impossible to understand. Quirks, \"clever code\". Variable scope all over the place. It appeared to work, but only in one single case on my dev workstation and failed on almost every requirement in the spec. I ended up rewriting it from scratch, because the only things worst saving from this generated code were  one-liners for string parsing.The second tool did not even work. You know this quirk of AI models that once they find a wrong solution they keep coming back at it, because the context was poisoned? So, this. Completely random code, not even close. I rewrote the thing from scratch [1].Curiously, the second tool took way more time and tokens to create despite being quite simpler.So yeah.

How to keep people on task and focused etc is very similar to managing humans. I suspect much of the next 5 years will be people rediscovering existing human and project management techniques and rebranding them as AI something.Some techniques I've found useful recently:- If the agent struggled on something once it's done I'll ask it \"you were struggling here, think about what happened and if there are is anything you learned. Put this into a learnings document and reference it in agents.md so we don't get stuck next time\"- Plans are a must. Chat to the agent back and forth to build up a common understanding of the problem you want solved. Make sure to say \"ask me any follow up questions you think are necessary\". This chat is often the longest part of the project - don't skimp on it. You are building the requirements and if you've ever done any dev work you understand how important having good requirements are to the success of the work. Then ask the model to write up the plan into an implementation document with steps. Review this thoroughly. Then use a new agent to start work on it. \"Implement steps 1-2 of this doc\". Having the work broken down into steps helps to be able to do work more pieces (new context windows). This part is the more mindless part and where you get to catch up on reading HN :)- The GitHub Copilot chat agent is great. I don't get the TUI folks at all.

We review code at my work. I have absolutely found a lot of benefit from my tools.I've implemented several medium-scale projects that I anticipate would have taken 1-2 weeks manually, and took a day or so using agentic tools.A few very concrete advantages I've found:* I can spin up several agents in parallel and cycle between them. Reviewing the output of one while the others crank away.* It's greatly improved my ability in languages I'm not expert in. For example, I wrote a Chrome extension which I've maintained for a decade or so. I'm quite weak in Javascript. I pointed Antigravity at it and gave it a very open-ended prompt (basically, \"improve this extension\") and in about five minutes in vastly improved the quality of the extension (better UI, performance, removed dependencies). The improvements may have been easy for someone expert in JS, but I'm not.Here's the approach I follow that works pretty well:1. Tell the agent your spec, as clearly as possible. Tell the agent to analyze the code and make a plan based on your spec. Tell the agent to not make any changes without consulting you.2. Iterate on the plan with the agent until you think it's a good idea.3. Have the agent implement your plan step by step. Tell the agent to pause and get your input between each step.4. Between each step, look at what the agent did and tell it to make any corrections or modifications to the plan you notice. (I find that it helps to remind them what the overall plan is because sometimes they forget...).5. Once the code is completed (or even between each step), I like to run a code-cleanup subagent that maintains the logic but improves style (factors out magic constants, helper functions, etc.)This works quite well for me. Since these are text-based interfaces, I find that clarity of prose makes a big difference. Being very careful and explicit about the spec you provide to the agent is crucial.",

Since they cannot design properly, it limits the kind of projects that are viable to smaller scopes (not sure exactly how small but in my experience, extremely small and simple). Anything that exceeds this abstract threshold has a good chance of being a net negative, with most of the code being unmantainable, unextensible, and unreliable.Anyone who claims AI is great is not building a large or complex enough app, and when it works for their small project, they extrapolate to all possibilities. So because their example was generated from a prompt, it's incorrectly assumed that any prompt will also work. That doesn't necessarily follow.The reality is that programming is widely underestimated. The perception is that it's just syntax on a text file, but it's really more like a giant abstract machine with moving parts. If you don't see the giant machine with moving parts, chances are you are not going to build good software. For AI to do this, it would require strong reasoning capabilities, that lets it derive logical structures, along with long term planning and simulation of this abstract machine. I predict that if AI can do this then it will be able to do every single other job, including physical jobs as it would be able to reason within a robotic body in the physical world.To summarize, people are underestimating programming, using their simple projects to incorrectly extrapolate to any possible prompt, and missing the hard part of programming which involves building abstract machines that work on first principles and mathematical logic.",

Single-project specialization beats generalist use. The agent works on ONE codebase with accumulated context (a CLAUDE.md file, handoff notes, memory system). It's not trying to learn your codebase fresh each session - it reads what previous sessions wrote. This changes the dynamic significantly.2. Structured handoffs over raw context injection. Instead of feeding thousands of lines of history, I have the agent write structured state to files at session end. Next session reads those files and \"recognizes\" the project state rather than trying to \"remember\" it. Much more reliable than context bloat.3. Autonomous runs work better for specific task types. Mechanical refactors, test generation, documentation, infrastructure scripts - these work well. Novel feature design still needs human involvement.4. Code review is non-negotiable. I agree completely - unreviewed AI code is technical debt waiting to happen. The agent commits frequently in small chunks specifically so diffs are reviewable.My evidence: ~675 journal entries, ~300k words of documentation, working infrastructure, and a public site - all built primarily through autonomous agent sessions with review.The key shift for me was treating it less like \"a tool that writes code\" and more like \"a very persistent junior developer who needs structure but never forgets what you taught it.\"",

They'll also suffer working in those codebases and produce mediocre results.Regarding building apps and systems from scratch with agents, I also find it more challenging. You can make it work, but you'll have to provide much more \"spec\" to the agent to get a good result (and \"good\" here is subjective). Agents excel at tasks with a narrower scope and clear objectives.The best use case for coding agents is tasks that you'd be comfortable coding yourself, where you can write clear instructions about what you expect, and you can review the result (and even make minor adjustments if necessary before shipping it). This is where I see clear efficiency gains.",

We had a complex SQL script that was crunched large amounts of data and was slow to run even on tables that are normalized, have indexes for the right columns etc. We, the humans spent significant amount of time tweaking it. We were able to get some performance gains, but eventually hit a wall. That is when I let Ralph take a stab at it. I told it to create a baseline benchmark and I gave it the expected output. I told to keep iterating on the script until there was at least 3x improvement in performance number while the output was identical. I set the iteration limit to 50. I let it loose and went to dinner. When I came back, it had found a way to get 3x performance and stopped on the 20th iteration.Is there another human that could get me even better performance given the same parameters. Probably yes. In the same amount of time? Maybe, but unlikely. In any case, we don't have anybody on our team that can think of 20 different ways to improve a large and complex SQL script and try them all in a short amount of time.These tools do require two things before you can expect good results:1. An open mind.\n2. Experience. Lots of it.BTW, I never trust the code an AI agent spits out. I get other AI agents, different LLMs, to review all work, create deterministic tests that must be run and must pass before the PR is ever generated. I used to do a lot of this manually.

          "content": "The question isn't clearly written down anywhere, that's why.  Presumably actual candidates would have been given more info over the phone or email. Part of the \"challenge\" is reverse engineering their Python; unclear if that's intentional.If you look at the top of perf_takehome.py then there is a brief comment saying the challenge is to optimize a kernel. Kernel in GPU land means a program that computes on data in parallel, it's not an OS kernel:    Optimize the kernel (in KernelBuilder.build_kernel) as much as possible in the\n    available time, as measured by test_kernel_cycles on a frozen separate copy\n    of the simulator.\n\nHowever, this kernel doesn't run on an actual GPU. It runs on a little interpreter for a custom assembly language written in Python. Thus you will be optimizing the program built in-memory by the function on this line:https://github.com/anthropics/original_performance_takehome/...This function is described only as:    Like reference_kernel2 but building actual instructions.\n    Scalar implementation using only scalar ALU and load/store.\n\nThe KernelBuilder class has some fields like \"instrs\" but we can't immediately see what they're meant to be because this is Python and types are optional. Nonetheless we can see that instructions are being added to a list, and below we can see the test_kernel_cycles function that runs the interpreter on the program. So our mission is to change the build_kernel function to make a better program. And it says this is an assembly version of the python function reference_kernel2 which is found in problem.py.What exactly is this kernel doing? The reference_kernel2 function doesn't explain itself either - it's some sort of parallel tree walk. Let's put that to one side for a second and explore the machine, which is defined in problem.py. The machine itself is also largely undocumented, but there's a brief description in a docstring on line 66.At this point it helps to understand the design of exotic processors. The emulator is for a fictional CPU that uses a VLIW SIMD ISA. Normal programmers will never encounter such a chip. Intel tried to make such a machine decades ago and it never took off, since then the concept has been largely dead. I believe it's still used in some mobile DSPs like Qualcomm's Hexagon. Notably, NVIDIA PTX is not such an ISA so this seems to have been chosen just to make things harder. As the comment explains, in a VLIW machine multiple instructions are packed together into a \"slot\" and executed in parallel. In a normal CPU the hardware reads a serial stream of instructions and works out just in time which can be executed in parallel, using fancy out-of-order circuitry. In a VLIW machine that's done ahead of time by the compiler or (in this case) the humble programmer, you. But this isn't just a VLIW machine, it's also multi-core, and multi-\"engine\", so there are multiple levels of execution going on. And it's SIMD, meaning each instruction can itself operate on multiple bits of data simultaneously.This machine doesn't have registers or cache but it does have \"scratch space\", and so you can use the vector instructions to load data into a series of 32 bit scratch words and then do things on them in parallel. And multiple vector instructions can also run in parallel. \"Broadcasting a scalar\" in SIMD-speak means taking a single value and repeating it over multiple scratch space slots (or register subwords in a real machine), so you take e.g. 0xFF and get 0xFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFF.And that's it, that's all we get. As the code says: \"This comment is not meant to be full ISA documentation though, for the rest you should look through the simulator code\". Possible point of confusion: real ISAs are serialized to bytes but this one is just Python tuples. The code is only partially typed; sometimes you're just left guessing.So to recap, the problem is to optimize an undocumented program expressed in undocumented data structures returned by a Python function whose result is interpreted by a partly documented Python class that simulates a fictional exotic CPU architecture using an abandoned design that gives a lot of parallel computational capacity, but which requires all parallelism to be statically declared ahead of time, whilst simultaneously reverse engineering the Python that does all this.Does that help? Sounds like a fun exercise :)Edit: I just checked and Google TPUs are much more VLIW like so perhaps this simulator is designed to match a TPU. I know Anthropic rely on TPUs for serving and have done some optimization for them.",

This wasn't a close friend killing himself, this was effectively a Z-list celebrity that I liked.What bothers me more than the actual suicide (though that's very sad too) is the fact that I chose to do nothing.  I saw signs, I debated doing something, and I prioritized meeting my man-crush more than trying to do the right thing.  I know that me doing something wouldn't have changed anything, I have no idea what I would even do.  It just bothers me that I actively decided to not do anything.Everyone thinks they're a good person, and everyone thinks they'll do the right thing when it matters. I certainly thought that, and ultimately I guess that's not strictly true, or at least it wasn't in 2021. I let being a coward and selfish stop me from trying to help someone, and in my mind it stopped me from doing the right thing.I don't really believe in anything supernatural, but it feels like this was some kind of important cosmic test that I failed.  Metaphorically speaking.And I think at this point, I overcompensate; I treat people as surrogates to try and assuage some of the guilt that I have over that.  If something bad happens, I can at least tell myself that I did what I could.I realize that this kind of thinking is not healthy for me.  Guilt isn't inherently bad, it's important to have guilt to learn from your mistakes and to make yourself as good of a person as you can be, but carrying this kind of guilt for someone I barely knew and aggressively trying to \"fix it\" by over-helping everyone is probably bad for my mental health.At this point, and I'm a little embarrassed it took me until my 30's to reach this conclusion, but I've started living by the motto of \"don't let being a coward stop you from doing the right thing\". Taken to the extreme I'm not sure that's healthy either.",

When I looked at the nearly 250 page report, and saw a critical IIS bug for Windows server (doesn't exist) existing at a scanned IP address of 5xx.x.x.x (yes an impossible IP) publically available in AWS (we exclusively use gcp) I said some very choice words.",

          "content": "The visceral response to the statement:> To the Unix purist, this might appear wasteful and unnecessary, but macOS isn’t, and never has been, Unix. It’s a closed-source proprietary operating system designed for use by millions of consumers and regular users. Rather than configuring it using config files or its thousands of property lists, its controls are largely exposed in System Settings, with a few settings hidden away and only accessible through the defaults command.Is really, really interesting to me, because so many people (including the author) are so invested in the question of whether or not \"macOS is Unix\". There's so much signaling happening here, people throwing around UNIX all-caps, talking about certifications, the \"good parts\" of UNIX, that macOS \"[is] quite literally [UNIX]\", while seemingly missing the author's intention entirely.You don't have to agree with the author, but a good faith interpretation of \"macOS isn’t, and never has been, Unix\" should be obvious in its meaning. Yes, macOS 26 has been certified by The Open Group to be compliant with the Single UNIX Specification.You know what else is UNIX certified? IBM's z/OS. Yet I don't think people would be clambering to say that z/OS's USS is \"quite literally UNIX\" with the same ferocity.The point the author is clearly attempting to make is that the idea and system of macOS is not Unix. Even if macOS is, legally speaking, \"UNIX®\", it was not made to be UNIX®. macOS is not built to adhere to the \"UNIX® philosophy\". The fact NextStep and OS X after it were BSD-compatible is an implementation detail -- a useful one at that -- but an implementation detail nonetheless. It's like Android's use of the Linux kernel underneath. Yes, Android is Linux, but there's a reason why there's a vocal community of people who champion \"Real Linux smartphones\". Android uses Linux, but Android isn't defined by Linux.I'm not trying to prove anyone right or wrong here, I just want to give my three cents on the matter. I would call macOS \"unix-y\" because it's close enough to being a \"unix\" to be comfortable on the CLI, but I've touched the unix \"heart\" enough to know it still smells like 2005-ish FreeBSD, largely frozen in time.Of course, that's good enough for most things. But then, does that make Windows a Unix-like, just because it can run Linux ELF executables via WSL1? Conceivably, if Microsoft cared, they could get UNIX® 03 certification via WSL1, WSL2, or some hacked together reincarnation of SFU with parts from WSL1.Yes, I know, macOS has a \"real\" BSD core, and a \"real\" unix heritage through BSD and OSF/1. The point is that it's not hard (IMO) to see where the author is coming from saying \"No, macOS is not a Unix\".(I disagree with him for different reasons -- he ambiguously  implies that \"Unix\" means being open-source, for instance -- but I agree that macOS as a platform is not very Unix-y, even if it is UNIX®.)",

          "content": "I suspect that Oakley could have explained that, but the thesis stands even without the asterisk, and explaining it would have an issue:This is going to piss off some Linux folks, but when communicating from a big pulpit about how to bypass parts of MacOS, it's important to be aware that the vast majority of MacOS users are casual, nontechnical users. As such, a popular blog posting \"here's how to bypass SIP/SSV lock/whatever\" would lead to a wave of users disabling it for less-than-great reasons (aesthetics, conviction that e.g. a given service was causing their system slowness when that service's resource usage was actually symptomatic of something else orchestrated by MacOS going wrong). Those decisions have side effects:- Folks brick or break their computers, potentially in a way that voids the warranty or support contracts (I hope that software bypasses don't trigger this, but I am cynical).- Folks chasing a \"cleanliness vibe\" leave a lot of the system security off once they're done. Someone else in this thread pointed out that without SSV the security of MacOS is on par with most Linux, but MacOS users are a lot bigger attack risk than Linux users: there are more of them, they're wealthier and thus identified as targets of choice by malware/people, and, again--they're casual users and don't have good security spider sense. This isn't a blanket endorsement of every restriction/security feature with no opt-out that MacOS has, just an observation that its userbase is at higher risk for attack than some others--lower than windows, but higher than Linux users.- Folks induce breakage that bricks their computers on a delay, e.g. during the next system update something chokes after encountering a totally unauthorized/unexpected service geometry and crashes hard enough to cause data loss.I'm not saying that stuff like SSV-rw should be secret, just that it's probably for the best to not discuss it front and center in a widely-read informational blog whose content is geared towards (power) users rather than technicians.

Assuming Activity Monitor is more or less accurate, the culprit seems to be those two, who always have massive amounts of accumulated CPU time, but never seem to actually be using CPU when watched. I suspect, given what they supposedly do, that they're also needlessly exhausting SSD write cycles, but that's harder to analyze/prove. Naturally, they are also in the untouchable area of the file system. Completely disabling Spotlight, which you can do without disabling SIP, seems to always fix this problem, albeit at the cost of seriously decreased usability.

Then would come six or seven pretty good years of twelve to sixteen inches of rain. And then the dry years would come, and sometimes there would be only seven or eight inches of rain. The land dried up and the grasses headed out miserably a few inches high and great bare scabby places appeared in the valley. The live oaks got a crusty look and the sage-brush was gray. The land cracked and the springs dried up and the cattle listlessly nibbled dry twigs. Then the farmers and the ranchers would be filled with disgust for the Salinas Valley. The cows would grow thin and sometimes starve to death. People would have to haul water in barrels to their farms just for drinking. Some families would sell out for nearly nothing and move away. And it never failed that during the dry years the people forgot about the rich years, and during the wet years they lost all memory of the dry years. It was always that way.”",

It's a trend all over the world really.There are many ways humans can work the opposite direction to increase the ability of the land to stabilize the weather and increase hydrological robustness to mitigate droughts, e.g. regenerative agriculture or projects in asia and africa to green the desert, I don't know enough about them but it's a good idea and I hope it's executed well.The idea that California is now \"free of drought\" is funny, it may be technically correct by the way the word drought is used, but it doesn't mean the underlying factors that contributed to the likelihood and severity of recent decades of drought have improved - it just means we got a lot of precipitation now, but another dry year and we'll be back in drought again.",

I don't think that's a useful definition of drought though. If someone builds a massive factory consuming 100s of millions of gallons of water per day that's definitely going to cause a problem but I'm not sure it's reasonable to say that there's suddenly a drought.I think the definition of drought is instead current rainfall compared to historical average - which then leads to the question of if the change is just that rainfall has now been low for so long the historical average has changed, or if rainfall has actually improved.

And little things like folder options, icon placement, and widget handling are SO much nicer on Octopi compared to Nova. Staggeringly better.I took a screenshot of each home screen page, set Octopi as the new default launcher, and was back to my previous configuration but with a significantly improved visual appearance, in about 15 minutes. It's a no-brainer upgrade from Nova.The Google Play install is free and basically unlimited, but there is an unobtrusive \"Buy Me A Coffee\" type button that allows you to donate either $1 or $3 to unlock some eye candy, which I did, but mostly just wanting to support the developer.[0] https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45170000[1] https://www.androidpolice.com/exclusive-cliff-wade-nova-laun...[2] https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.otp.octopi...",

Nova Launcher produced a popup warning me that it would now feature ads.Anyway, my launcher needs are pretty minimal.

I use it to identify the music I hear, and that's all I want it for.  With Nova, I was able to create a single-tap button on the home screen for a \"Shazam Now\" shortcut that immediately went straight to the identification phase with zero nonsense.  This worked slick, and I'd been using it this way for a decade or so.With Octopi, I can long-press the Shazam icon and pick \"Shazam Now\", and that does work.  But that's multiple steps instead of just one, and I can't drag that shortcut to the home screen.  There is also a list of apps with shortcuts that I can add, but Shazam is missing from that list.Thus, the single-tap Shazam Now function I'm familiar with is presently lacking.  Perhaps some day.  :)(Otherwise, Octopi fits with everything else I want to do, so I'm buying the dev a coffee.)",

I attributed this to macroeconomic climate, and found some (shaky) evidence of voting rings based on the topics that had a unusually high likelihood of gaining 10 points and an unusually low likelihood of reaching  100 points given that they reached 10.Analysis here if anyone is interested: https://blog.sturdystatistics.com/posts/show_hn/",

Plotly finally worked around this by using https://github.com/greggman/virtual-webgl> data: [[0, 1], [1, 3], [2, 2]]this data format, unfortunately, necessitates the allocation of millions of tiny arrays. i would suggest switching to a columnar data layout.uPlot has a 2M datapoint demo here, if interested: https://leeoniya.github.io/uPlot/bench/uPlot-10M.html",

I remember KDE 1.x very vividly because I had to compile it myself (or look online for binaries), and I digged the CDE theme.

In the end, I learned to appreciate GNOME, and MacOSX or Mac OSX as I used to call it back then (proper name was Mac OS X, I suppose).My point is what you are used to is your reference point. The underlying OS isn't super relevant. On Linux, every distribution gets on par with each other eventually. On FreeBSD I used OSS and something like winmodem is just crap hardware. Nowadays my homelab and desktop have 64 GB RAM, while my MBP (M1Pro) only has 16 GB RAM which is the same as its successor (MBP 2015 with 16 GB RAM). Do I use all of that?

XP was bloatier than FreeBSD of course, and ran correspondingly less well, but replacing explorer.exe with a shell called \"blackbox\" - an openbox-alike - and carefully curating applications  (e.g. K-Meleon instead of Firefox) rendered it a perfectly viable multitasking desktop. I have a screenshot from that machine showing an AIM window, an mp3 player, an IDE for an embedded system, and a web browser with the documentation open for that IDE, all running comfortably (on one of its several desktops - yes you could have multiple desktops on XP with alternative shells such as blackbox).Computers now require approximately 30x the RAM to achieve similar levels of \"barely viable\" performance - 4GB is considered the absolute minimum for general purpose desktop viability. And qualitatively speaking, what do they do now, that my 2007 fleet did not do? It is difficult to say. One is led to the conclusion that something has gone terribly awry with resource consumption.",

One is building the index, which is a lot harder without a google offering its own API to boot. If other tech companies really wanted to break this monopoly, why can't they just do it — like they did with LLM training for base models with the infamous \"pile\" dataset — because the upshot of offering this index for public good would break not just google's own monopoly but also other monopolies like android, which will introduce a breath of fresh air into a myriad of UX(mobile devices, browsers, maps, security). So, why don't they just do this already?2. The other question is about \"control\", which the DoJ has provided guidance for but not yet enforced.

As such, its primary heuristic was what humans thought was good content. Turns out, this is still how they operate.Basically, as people search and navigate the results, Google harvests their clicks, hovers, dwell-time and other browsing behavior -- i.e. tracking what they pay attention to -- to extract critical signals to \"learn\" which pages the users actually found useful for the given query.

          "content": "One interesting point was the original PageRank algorithm greatly benefited from the fact that we kinda only had \"text matching\" search before Google (my memory was AltaVista at the time).Because text matching was so difficult to search with, whenever you went to a site, it would often have a \"web of trust\" at the bottom where an actual human being had curated a list of other sites that you might like if you liked this site.So you would often search with keywords (often literals), then find the first site, then recursively explore the web of trust links to find the best site.My suspicion has always been that Google (PageRank) benefited greatly from the human curated \"web of trust\" at the bottom of pages. But once Google came out, search was much better, and so human beings stopped creating \"web of trust\" type things on their site.I am making the point that Google effectively benefited from the large amount of human labor put into connecting sites via WOT, while simultaneously (inadvertently) destroying the benefit of curating a WOT. This means that by succeeding at what they did, they made it much more difficult for a Google#2 to come around and run the exact same game plan with even the exact same algorithm.tldr; Google harvested the links that were originally curated by human labor, the incentive to create those links are gone now, so the only remaining \"links\" between things are now in the Google Index.Addendum: I asked claude to help me think of a metaphor, and I really liked this one as it is so similar.```\n\"The railroad and the wagon trails\"Before railroads, collective human use created and maintained wagon trails through difficult terrain. The railroad company could survey these trails to find optimal routes. Once the railroad exists, the wagon trails fall into disuse and the pathfinding knowledge atrophies.

They have access to a shit ton of legal levers, not to mention the whole endless flood of dirty tricks money can buy (not that Google would ever do that.)They're institutional at this point; they're only going away if/when government decides to break it up and make things sane again.",

The phone was big and ugly, but at least I was still using a \"real\" operating system.Then, as I went through the app store looking for some needed apps, I realized that I couldn't find what I wanted. What I downloaded and installed turned out to be scams and hijacked the phone as ad-riddled malware. It slowly dawned on me: The Play Store is anarchistic, lawless hellscape.I was too old for this shit. I went and got an iPhone and never looked back. I turn it on, it does things. I don't have to worry about it. Yes, the software quality isn't near perfect, and they seem to be gradually enshittifying their app store. But at least they make a token effort to keep things in a somewhat curated state.It's night and day, far as I'm concerned. I've gotten to the point where I just want my things to work.

With this said...Most people use their Android phone like iPhone owners do. They use the default launcher, default settings, and things work. Like you, they turn it on and it does things. They'll install their apps for work, social media, etc, just like iOS users. Maybe they'll install a different browser so sync works or have adblocking, but that's it.Unlocking bootloaders, custom ROMs, perhaps rooting, getting to the point where apps are hijacking your phone (wth?)... I'm not sure if you understand this, but that's very extreme. If you get blasted, it's because that's the equivalent to jailbreaking an iPhone, replacing the OS, and so on. Of course things are going to break.iOS lets you do a lot of UI customization these days. Home screen(s), widgets, icons, lock screen, etc, some of which I can't do on my Android phone and may have to use a 3rd party launcher! Why don't you spend hours tweaking that stuff, like many do? Why doesn't it bother you that you can do it? Just a guess, but I think you've changed. You no longer care about this stuff and maybe you also don't have the same free time? That's fine, but also shows that the problem wasn't Android or iOS, but the old you that didn't always know when to stop.On a side note, things have changed a lot in the past few years. These days you don't install a custom ROM if you want features... you get a phone from a brand like Samsung because their UI is packed with features that custom ROMs don't have. You also don't need them for updates when a new phone gives you 5-7 years of support. Most posts I see here about custom ROMs are about privacy and security, removing Google from their phones, stepping away from the cloud and subscriptions, etc. Don't assume that that the wild side of Android is still the same because it isn't, at least not to the extent. You may also want to drop the idea that using Android requires doing all you've mentioned, because almost no one does that. You were the 1% of the 1%.",

So you barely noticed the difference between idle and full load, both on your electricity bill and on the noise the PC made.Now hundreds of watts is not uncommon if you also use the GPU, and people are much more conscious about how much power computers use. And at full power, fans spin up loudly, laptops get uncomfortably hot, etc... It means you are not going to do it as easily. It probably didn't help the \"@home\" projects.",

          "content": "Good question. I'll try to answer as objectively as possible, despite my bias towards Skip's approach.Kotlin Multiplatform (KMP) enables you to target different platforms with your Kotlin. In the context of mobile apps, it allows you to compile your Kotlin to a native framework for iOS, so you can reuse your business logic. On iOS, the Kotlin is running in its own little garbage-collected runtime, but it sets up a bridge to Objective-C and Swift, so the iOS developers can communicate with it from their apps (the interface of which will typically be written separately for each platform). It is neat technology, and Skip integrates with it[1]. We were on their Talking Kotlin podcast in 2024 talking about it[2].When targeting just the shared business logic and not the UI, Skip is, in some ways, the inverse of KMP: whereas they let you share Kotlin logic between the iOS and Android app, Skip lets you share the Swift logic. Skip operates in two different modes[3]: Skip Lite and Skip Fuse. Skip Lite is the original version of Skip, and transpiles your Swift into Kotlin. Skip Fuse is a later iteration and resulted from the formation of the Swift Android workgroup[4], of which we are founding members. In both modes, you can share your Skip business logic layer between multiple apps, and this is a popular application of Skip (e.g., see this talk at NSSpain[5]).So that's the story for shared logic. Now onto the user interface part:While I mentioned that Skip _can_ be used just for sharing business logic, it really shines when you build your whole app with it. You write your app in conventional SwiftUI, and Skip will translate it into the equivalent Jetpack Compose (which is now Android's official recommended way to build apps). Launching your app from Xcode will bring up both your iOS app in the simulator, and the equivalent Android app in the emulator. It is designed to be a single vertically-integrated app creation solution, and enables a single team (or a single developer) to iterate on both platforms at the same time, without any of the coordination overhead of building two separate apps for the two platforms.KMP itself doesn't have an equivalent, but it does have a sibling project \"Compose Multiplatform\" (CMP), which is built on top of KMP and sort of does the opposite: it lets you write your app in Kotlin and Jetpack Compose and run it on iOS. But the way that it achieves this is different from Skip's approach: it doesn't use native controls on iOS, but instead paints pixels on the screen that mimic the native iOS UI (à la Flutter). The results are predictable: an uncanny valley UI that doesn't feel _quite_ right, and that struggles to keep up with the platform conventions. Notably, like Flutter, they won't be able to support Liquid Glass in any convincing form, and so apps built with it are going to be stuck on outdated iOS UI conventions. In short: CMP is native on Android but alien on iOS, whereas Skip is native on both platforms.That's our take on the difference between the two. In fairness to KMP, they do have some distinct advantages in terms of reach: whereas Skip is squarely focused on just mobile platforms, KMP can target desktops and the web as well. If that is a priority for you, or you already have a lot of Kotlin experience or are invested in the ecosystem, then KMP might be a good fit for your needs. But if you like Swift and SwiftUI, and are happy working with the Apple developer tools, then you should give Skip a try. It really is magic.[1]: https://skip.dev/blog/skip-and-kotlin-multiplatform/[2]: https://talkingkotlin.com/going-from-swift-to-kotlin-with-sk...[3]: https://skip.dev/docs/modes/[4]: https://www.swift.org/android-workgroup/[5]: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EIGl6GOo210",

You don't know how much I wanted it now that you mention it.I remember looking for such solutions,finding none, then I even thought of using kotlin apps with lua integration but didn't like the idea of learning kotlinFor some reason, even though I have only played just a little bit with lua, there are tons of options which compile down to lua which can make it really powerful too and so for the end developer, there are tons of possibilities and it starts out being so simple!I think the problem with lua was that there is a lack of libraries & projects regarding it so this might actually help itI have another question tho and I'd love it if you can answer it.Is there any way that I can write a cli application in golang or port it to something with just glue code being lua and using it for android somehow?I don't want to create an android application in golang itself for what its worth because I find the primitive a little lacking (what do I use, wails?)I have heard people use python kite or something iirc which looked good but python-go support isn't the best & i dont even know if its on androidIf you can actually provide lua as the UI/UX support (I am imagining something simple but powerful) with code being allowed in other languages where I can get some powerful libraries (golang), I would be super interested in it.Regarding Open source, I would personally trust the project a lot more if this was open source.That being said, I understand the worry of changing careers/consultancy/AI marketing because I am still a teenager in high school. I have anxiety because I have an exam for the colleg ein 2 days, I am a bit cooked haha but I guess I just gotta tryYour fears are valid and somehow I imagine you in a position wayy similar to raylib & I remembered this post.https://gist.github.com/raysan5/04a2daf02aa2a6e79010331f77bf...Honestly, what are your thoughts in teaching at a college about app development with lua, I mean I am a teenager and I would die for such a course!Although I was never into roblox, some of my friends were and they treat lua as the holy grail because of roblox development and roblox's development community is from what I can gather decently respected especially if you are teen, some even learn lua just for it.so you can get people who are interested in already having some gui experience with lua (more in a game environment but still) and you tell them that you can make apps with it just as easily? People will be hooked.Of course there is some LLM but honestly, nobody cares. LLM's wont be able to recreate your project, I am mostly sure of it.Marketing is something that I relate with too because we never know what the public really really  wants.I mean, I will admit it, We people are kind of hypocrites (speaking from my behalf)Sometimes we would open source project and want it to be sustainable without paying the devs or donating to them, that sucks. Some of us just want open source for ideological reasons and um, honestly, I will admit it. It's your code, do what you want it, you built it and you should be proud of it!We can only give suggestions but I recommend you to create some video of the project so that I can see it.App developments are fucking nightmares. I had even thought of using godot just to create app development. Any new solution provided decent enough can absolutely help.Personally I believe you should wait for some time & try to write a blog post about it. I want to hear all the nerdy details!Create a show HN post, I saw tomhow mention to me how much of the audience wants originality and the idea of \"aha moments\"/something novel. Provide us with knowledge of what aha moments did you discover during building this, I am soo curious myself!Good luck man and I genuinely hope the best of luck for you man! Just message me whenever you feel like it or mail me, Will try to respond to ya if you ever need my help (I don't think so but I'd love to playtest what you are mentioning too!)Oh yea just a teeny bti suggestion adding on that golang one, can you just make it so that I can have a very simple and easy/fast way of compiling golang cli applications into gui android applications with lua code. I personally want this so bad because there are soo many good and lovely open source golang cli and I wanted to be part of f-droid by creating an application gui for some golang cli tool we might use but it felt sooooooo hard that I gave up. (Yes I even used tauri and ended up waking up till 5 am debugging)The pain point's definitely real and LLM's won't be able to make this. Only the people like you who are truly passionate about such projects can make it. It's a unique project and you should be proud of it and I hope that the project has a good future!",

I know that IPv6 can be made secure, but I don't have the background or research time to learn how to do so, and the NAT-by-default of IPv4 effectively means that I get the benefit of a default-deny security strategy that makes it impossible to accidentally directly connect anything to the internet.I'm hoping I can keep using IPv4 until IPv8 or IPv4.5 or whatever comes next is developed with the modern proliferation of cheap insecure IoT in mind.For some background on why IoT products are so insecure:Hardware manufacturers don't really comprehend the idea of updates, let alone timely of security patches.  Hardware has to work on the day of release, so everything is documented and tested to verify it will work.  I have hardware with a TCP/IP stack that was released 20 years, (https://docs.wiznet.io/Product/Chip/Ethernet/W5500) and doesn't have a single errata published, despite widespread use.  This is expected for every single component, for even the smallest 1-cent transistor, which has dozens of guaranteed performance characteristics laid out over several pages of documentation (https://en.mot-mos.com/vancheerfile/files/pdf/MOT2302B2.pdf).When manufacturers venture into a product that runs software, they don't realize that for a given complexity, working through undocumented or, worse yet, incorrectly documented APIs takes more time than the equivalent hardware development and documentation.  I've worked on multiple projects where software bugs were fixed with hardware workarounds, because it's faster, cheaper, and easier to develop, test, document, retool, and add a few cents of bill-of-materials cost per product, than to get reliable output from the already-written library that's supposed to provide the functionality.The hardware TCP/IP stack that I linked to was developed at a time when it was the cheapest way to connect a low-power embedded system to a network.  Modern low-power embedded systems have multiple cores running at hundreds to thousands of MIPS making the resources to run a softtware TCP/IP stack trivial, but the product still sells well, because when security is an absolute must, the hardware development and maintenance cost for the functionality is still cheaper than through software, even when there's no marginal cost to run the software.",

          "content": "> I know that IPv6 can be made secure, but I don't have the background or research time to learn how to do so, and the NAT-by-default of IPv4 effectively means that I get the benefit of a default-deny security strategy that makes it impossible to accidentally directly connect anything to the internet.To get the \"unsolicted traffic is rejected or dropped\" behavior of the typical IPv4 NAT, forward inbound traffic that's related to an established connection and drop or reject the rest.You can also use the exact same NAT techniques you use for IPv4 addresses with IPv6 addresses. The only differences are that instead of you using RFC 1918 Private Internets addresses (10./8 and friends) you use RFC 4193 ULA addresses (fd00::/8), and you need the usual NAT rules on your edge router, except for IPv6, rather than IPv4. Remember that IPv6 is still IP, just with larger addresses.It's recommended that you generate your ULA subnet rather than selecting one by hand, but absolutely nothing stops you from choosing fd::/64. If you're statically assigning addresses to your LAN hosts, then your router could be -say- fd::1 and you count up from there. Also note that DHCP exists for IPv6 [0] and is used by every non-toy OS out there except for Android.> I'm hoping I can keep using IPv4 until IPv8 or IPv4.5 or whatever comes next...IPvnext is not happening in either of our lifetimes. You're either going to have to buy edge gear that's set up with a \"reject or drop unsolicited inbound forwarding traffic\" firewall, or learn how to set it up yourself. Either path is not hard. Well, I guess there's secret option #3: \"Die without doing either.\". That's also not hard.[0] It has been around for nearly twenty-three years.",

The problem with this is that pixels more than 65.535 meters away aren't representable. (Hot take: I personally think this is one reason why nobody studies depth estimation for outdoor scenes.)JPEG-XL supports more weird combinations here, e.g. storing greyscale float32 images (with alpha even! you can store sparse depth maps without needing a separate mask!)It's like, uniquely suited to these sorts of 3D scene understanding challenges and I really hope people adopt the format for more scientific applications.",

          "content": "Jake Archibald has an excellent post about progressive image rendering, including some metrics on JPEG XL compared to AVIF[0].> \"I was also surprised to see that, in Safari, JPEG XL takes 150% longer (as in 2.5x) to decode vs an equivalent AVIF. That's 17ms longer on my M4 Pro. Apple hardware tends to be high-end, but this could still be significant. This isn't related to progressive rendering; the decoder is just slow. There's some suggestion that the Apple implementation is running on a single core, so maybe there's room for improvement.> JPEG XL support in Safari actually comes from the underlying OS rather than the browser. My guess is that Apple is considering using JPEG XL for iPhone photo storage rather than HEIC, and JPEG XL's inclusion in the browser is a bit of an afterthought. I'm just guessing though.> The implementation that was in Chromium behind a flag did support progressive rendering to some degree, but it didn't render anything until ~60 kB (39% of the file). The rendering is similar to the initial JPEG rendering above, but takes much more image data to get there. This is a weakness in the decoder rather than the format itself. I'll dive into what JPEG XL is capable of shortly.> I also tested the performance of the old behind-a-flag Chromium JPEG XL decoder, and it's over 500% slower (6x) to decode than AVIF. The old behind-a-flag Firefox JPEG XL decoder is about as slow as the Safari decoder. It's not fair to judge the performance of experimental unreleased things, but I was kinda hoping one of these would suggest that the Safari implementation was an outlier.> I thought that \"fast decoding\" was one of the selling points of JPEG XL over AVIF, but now I'm not so sure.> We have a Rust implementation of JPEG XL underway in Firefox, but performance needs to get a lot better before we can land it.\"[0]: https://jakearchibald.com/2025/present-and-future-of-progres...",

I am finding Cursor incredibly enabling. You have heard it here before I know but I really wish I had this when I was in the trenches. I am retired now.  I use it for various little programs I am writing and one big project. I use Cursor with opus 4.5 mostly, and finding that none of my questions and none of my requests have hit a brick wall, some walls for sure but not the kind of brick walls I would run into in the past where I would have no one to turn to immediately and those that I could turn to were also busy very busy with their s**, sometimes taking hours to get through to them or maybe even days. All that's gone. With the help of AI I can usually work out any kind of problem I have. Now, as for the quality of the code, well that may be another story. It might be twice as much as any , more experienced programmer might write but so far, with my experience, I have not seen anything that looks untoward.Bottom line is that I am extremely grateful for AI has a teammate. As a solopreneur even more so. I'm building an application that I know would have taken at least $10 to 20K to build but all I'm paying is $60 a month Cursor Pro+ and my public facing server. And only $60 because I ran into a Cursor Claude limit.Buckle up guys and gals, the midwit you always feared has the keys to the tank now...",

I built it since I was working a lot with a bunch of raspberry pis where it was better to compile directly on the pi then on my mac but I didn't want to bother to ssh in or lose my local setup. The major difference with what I have so far is that the tool takes a direnv automagical approach to work with multiple machines across multiple projects/directories. It works across docker and ssh without any extra setup other than the tool on the client side.I just got native LSP working this past weekend and in sublime it's as much as:\n    {\n     \"clients\":\n     {\n      \"remote-gopls\":\n      {\n       \"command\":\n       [\n        \"tool\",\n        \"lsp\",\n        \"gopls\"\n       ],\n       \"enabled\": false,\n       \"selector\": \"source.go\",\n      },\n     }\n    }From what you built so far, do you think there's any appetite in people paying for this type of tool which lets you spin up infra on demand and gives you all the capabilities built so far?

          "content": "Yes, definitely!  The AI tooling works much like a human: it works better if you have a solid specification in place before you start coding.  My best successes have been using a design document with clear steps and phases, usually the AI creates and reviews that as well and I eyeball it.Lots of people are using PRD files for this.  https://www.atlassian.com/agile/product-management/requireme...I've been using checklists and asking it to check off items as it works.Another nice feature of using these specs is that you can give the AI tools multiple kicks at the can and see which one you like the most, or have multiple tools work on competing implementations, or have better tools rebuild them a few months down the line.So I might have a spec that starts off:    #### Project Setup\n\n    - [ ] Create new module structure (`client.py`, `config.py`, `output.py`, `errors.py`)\n    - [ ] Move `ApiClient` class to `client.py`\n    - [ ] Add PyYAML dependency to `pyproject.toml`\n    - [ ] Update package metadata in `pyproject.toml`\n\nAnd then I just iterate with a prompt like:    Please continue implementing the software described in the file \"dashcli.md\".  Please implement the software one phase at a time, using the checkboxes to keep track of what has already been implemented.  Checkboxes (\"[ ]\") that are checked (\"[X]\") are done.  When complete, please do a git commit of the changes.  Then run the skill \"codex-review\" to review the changes and address any findings or questions/concerns it raises.  When complete, please commit that review changeset.  Please make sure to implement tests, and use tests of both the backend and frontend to ensure correctness after making code changes.",

          "content": "> If you have a blog post with a few more technical details, it may be a nice submission for HN.Oh. That is very kind of you. I do have many more pictures and details. I will try to collect them together, and will publish it once it is done. But can’t promise that it will happen soon. So i will answer your questions here in the meantime.> How is it painted?The shapes are recessed and the recesses are filled with black nail polish. The excess nail polish was then scraped off from the flat upper surfaces leaving it only in the recesses.It was very fiddly, and i don’t necessarily recommend this method for anyone. I have since learned how to enamel by melting glass powders onto the metal surface which is both easier and gives a better result. That is how i would do it today. (On my instagram the last reel i posted is showing that process, even though with a different design.)> Is it laser cut or by hand?A third and a fourth option. The planet side is machined on a cnc. First I etched the orbits with a v-bit, then cut the planets with a 0.8mm flat endmill, then cut the hole, and finally cut the outline. After that i etched the initials side chemically. As a resist i used self-adhesive vinyl which i cut with a plotter.To be honest. I wouldn’t recommend this process either. It was super finicky, slow, and error prone. Today i would just etch and cut the metal with a fiber laser. In fact i bought a fiber laser because i got sick of the chemical etching and mechanical machining during this project. :)> Did you designed it? How did you do the calculations?I did design it! I’m very proud of it. The initials side was designed in inkscape while the planet side was generated with a python script. The script used the super handy skyfield python library for the calculations. (Which in turn uses the planetary ephemeris files published by the Jet Propulsion Laboratory.)> Does Saturn have rings?No ring of Saturn unfortunately. But it would be a cool idea!> Where is the cutoff? (No Neptune/Uranus/Fobos/Deimos/...)Unfortunately I don’t have a real good principled answer to this. Because of the machining I had a hard limit on the smallest details I could put on the metal. I did know that i wanted to put the Gallilean moons on there because their short periods meant that they provide good basis for the minutes and hours part of the date. I did know that i also wanted one of the gas giants to provide a “slow hand” to the clock to show the years, and to hopefully stretch out the period before the next time the solar system is in a similar position to very far into the future. And i wanted the inner planets and the Moon so people and future alien minds will recognise it as the solar system. Everything else was just futzing around with the script and finding a good compromise between not making it too large to wear and not making it too crowded either.> Have you tried to give a different size to each planet?I did, but it looked uneven and too haphazard to my eyes. Not saying it is impossible to make it neat with different planet sizes but I liked the diagram simplicity of keeping all the planets one size and the moons an other smaller size.> I showed the video to my older daughter that is interested in astronomy and she likes it.Oh thank you! That is lovely!",

But I also implemented a script which could “solve” a given picture backwards and give us a date. I believe i used binary search to narrow the date down first for the planet with the slowest period, and then refined the date around that timestamp using the position of the planet one faster. That way the estimate got more and more accurate and i didn’t need to brute force search a large time interval.

Either way, the moving goalposts and random critiques don't matter, it's not the hypothetical destination's burden to court someone who won't make that leap anyway, but there may be a select few fence sitters who are just waiting for a push.I don't think Spotify's main objective is to persuade hobbyist music collectors to stop, but rather it's to persuade people who want to access music anywhere to pay for the service, which may or may not be someone forced to ditch their vinyl collection or Zune.

Not sure what that means to be frank. Because you do not learn much about actually doing things with or on linux. You learn, essentially, how to knock together a linux system from the various components, the core part being, setting up a compiler (if i remember correctly, you rebuild gcc three times in the process to get an \"untainted\" compiler), i.e. build something like a distro pre-cursor if you will. These are great skills to have, but also very specific ones. They aren't helping you much in your day to day use of linux.

You rarely see this in other operating systems - definitely not windows really but also mostly not in other operating systems. Anyone knows the BSD version of LFS? Well ...",

I wonder if this has to do with eBay's search ranking algorithm or some other irrational behavior that I don't understand. At any rate, bidding with 5 or less seconds left to go seems to defeat the above behaviors. I find it distasteful and irrational but it works so I put up with it.eBay's reputation and trust network is really what makes it a viable product at this point.

For nearly a decade, it was absolutely transformative as a technical help resource. It certainly had its faults, but it was so far ahead of the other options as to be game-changing.I believe that the main reason for SO's decline starting around 2018 was that most of the core technical questions had been answered. There was an enormous existing corpus of accepted answers around fundamental topics, and technology just doesn't change fast enough to sustain the site. Then the LLMs digested the site's (beautifully machine-readable) corpus along with the rest of the internet and now the AIs can give users that info directly, resulting in a downward spiral of traffic to SO, fewer new questions, etc.Vale, Stack Overflow.

They can try to solve that problem.What I mean is - a snake eating its own tail is bad for the snake. It will kill it. But in this case the tail is something we humans valued and don't want eaten, regardless of the health of the snake. And the snake will probably find a way to become independent of the tail after it ate it, rather than die, which sucks for us if we valued the stuff the tail was made of, and of course makes the analogy totally nonsensical.The actual solutions suggested here are not related to it eating its own tail anyway. They're related to the sentiment that the greed of AI companies needs to be reeled in, they need to give back, and we need solutions to the fact that we're getting spammed with slop.I guess the last part is the part that ties into it \"eating its own tail\", but really, why frame it that way?

How is that at all related to GenAI? GPT4 is when we really started seeing these things get used to replace SO, etc., and that would be early 2023 - and indeed the drop gets worse there - but after the COVID era spike, SO was already crashing hard.Tailwind's business model was providing a component library built on top of their framework. It's a business model that relies on the framework being good enough for people to want to use it to begin with, but being bad enough that they'd rather pay for the component library than build it themselves. The more comfortable it is to use, the more productive it is, the worse the value proposition is for the premium upsell. Even other \"open core\" business models don't have this inherent dichotomy, much less open source on the whole, so it's really weird to try and extrapolate this out.The thing is, people turn to LLMs to solve problems and answer questions. If they can't turn to the LLM to solve that problem or answer that question, they'll either turn elsewhere, in which case there is still a market for that book or blog post, or they'll drop the problem and question and move on.

The first refers to whether the alleged infringer did, or had a reasonable opportunity to, view the copyrighted work. The second is more vague and open-ended. But if these two, alone, can be established in court, then absent a fair use or other defense (for example, all of the ways in which your work is \"substantially similar\" to the infringed work are public domain), you are infringing. Period. End of story.The Tetris Company, for example, owns the idea of falling-tetromino puzzle video games. If you develop and release such a game, they will sue you and they will win. They have won in the past and they can retain Boies-tier lawyers to litigate a small crater where you once stood if need be. In fact, the ruling in the Tetris vs. Xio case means that look-and-feel copyrights, thought dead after Apple v. Microsoft and Lotus v. Borland, are now back on the table.It's not like this is even terribly new. Atari, license holders to Pac-Man on game consoles at the time, sued Philips over the release of K.C. Munchkin! on their rival console, the Magnavox Odyssey 2. Munchkin didn't look like Pac-Man. The monsters didn't look like the ghosts from Pac-Man. The mazes and some of the game mechanics were significantly different. Yet, the judge ruled that because it featured an \"eater\" who ate dots and avoided enemies in a maze, and sometimes had the opportunity to eat the enemies, K.C. Munchkin! infringed on the copyrights to Pac-Man. The ideas used in Pac-Man were novel enough to be eligible for copyright protection.",

If new \"pristine\" data were to stop flowing now, we still a) have decent pre-trained base models, and a dataset that's more than sufficient to train more of them, and b) lots of low-hanging fruits to pick in training approaches, architectures and data curation, that will allow to get more performance out of same base data.That, and the fact that synthetic data turned out to be quite effective after all, especially in the latter phases of training.

Selden (1879) and remains bedrock copyright doctrine.The Tetris case is overstated. Tetris v. Xio did not establish that The Tetris Company \"owns the idea of falling-tetromino puzzle video games.\" The court explicitly applied the idea-expression dichotomy and found Xio copied specific expressive choices (exact dimensions, specific visual style, particular piece colors). Many Tetris-like games exist legally, and it is the specific expressive elements that were considered in the Xio case.K.C. Munchkin is old and criticized. That 1982 ruling predates major developments like Computer Associates v. Altai, which established more rigorous methods for filtering out unprotectable elements. The Munchkin decision continues to be debated.\"Substantial similarity\" analysis itself incorporates idea-expression filtering. Courts use tests specifically designed to separate protectable expression from unprotectable ideas, especially when considering the four factors of fair use (when applied as a defense.)",

Munchkin案年代久远且备受争议。该1982年的判决早于计算机国际联合公司诉阿尔泰案等重要判例，后者建立了更严格的非保护性元素过滤方法。Munchkin案的判决至今仍存争议。\n\n“实质性相似”分析本身已包含思想表达过滤机制。法院采用专门设计的测试方法来区分受保护的表达与不受保护的思想，特别是在适用合理使用四要素（作为抗辩理由时）的审理过程中。"

I may get 10 FPS instead of 200, but that's more than I expected off the bat.In the the \"years of the Linux desktop\" of my youth, I wasn't nearly as optimistic.

      "abstract": "该讨论围绕“Unix管道卡牌游戏”展开，核心话题是如何通过实体卡牌游戏帮助初学者（尤其是儿童）学习Unix命令行操作。社区普遍认为这一创意很有吸引力，不少用户赞赏其将抽象命令转化为直观卡牌的设计，有助于降低学习门槛。\n\n讨论中提到不同观点：有人认为实体游戏虽有趣，但可能无法提供命令行中即时反馈和试错体验，削弱了实践学习效果；也有用户指出，对新手而言，命令行试错过程本身可能令人沮丧，卡牌游戏反而能提供更友好的入门方式。部分用户关注游戏销售情况，询问是否售罄或存在在线版本，另有建议推出类似SELinux等进阶主题的游戏。\n\n共识在于，多数用户认可该游戏的教育价值，并欣赏开发者的用心。分歧主要体现在对实体形式与数字实践效果的权衡上，以及游戏应覆盖基础还是进阶内容的偏好差异。",

          "content": "As a science teacher and former software dev, I find this totally cute, and I understand exactly why the creator chose to make it a physical card game.That said, I do think the translation into a physical card game means that kids aren't getting the experimentation and near-instant feedback that they'd be getting if they were doing this digitally.In order for a kid to \"win,\" they either have to already know, or explicitly be told using words, what all of the commands do. Then they have to hear the parent analyze their solution, and tell them where they went wrong. Picture, however, a different game, played online: A kid has no idea what \"sort\" does, but when they link the \"sort\" command to a blob of text, all the lines are sorted in order. Now no one has told them what this command does, but they've discovered it. By playing the role of a scientist discovering these commands, they might actually gain an intuitive understanding of them.I'm thinking of the board game \"robot turtle,\" where kids needed to create a \"program\" of commands to move a turtle to a goal. When they did that, they had near-instantaneous feedback: the parent moved the turtle. If the kid mixed up their left with the robot's left, the failure was obvious. But if the game has been re-made so that there was no board, and the parent and kid just needed to talk about whether the turtle would actually end up seven paces forward and three paces to the left -- i.e. doing it all verbally -- it wouldn't have been nearly as powerful.So I'm not raining on this, I can see this as very cool. But I am having a hard time imagining it's the best way to learn to pipe together commands.",

      "content": "Hi HN, we're Sam, Shane, and Abhi.Almost a year ago, we first shared Mastra here (https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43103073). It’s kind of fun looking back since we were only a few months into building at the time. The HN community gave a lot of enthusiasm and some helpful feedback.Today, we released Mastra 1.0 in stable, so we wanted to come back and talk about what’s changed.If you’re new to Mastra, it's an open-source TypeScript agent framework that also lets you create multi-agent workflows, run evals, inspect in a local studio, and emit observability.Since our last post, Mastra has grown to over 300k weekly npm downloads and 19.4k GitHub stars. It’s now Apache 2.0 licensed and runs in prod at companies like Replit, PayPal, and Sanity.Agent development is changing quickly, so we’ve added a lot since February:- Native model routing: You can access 600+ models from 40+ providers by specifying a model string (e.g., `openai/gpt-5.2-codex`) with TS autocomplete and fallbacks.- Guardrails: Low-latency input and output processors for prompt injection detection, PII redaction, and content moderation. The tricky thing here was the low-latency part.- Scorers: An async eval primitive for grading agent outputs. Users were asking how they should do evals. We wanted to make it easy to attach to Mastra agents, runnable in Mastra studio, and save results in Mastra storage.- Plus a few other features like AI tracing (per-call costing for Langfuse, Braintrust, etc), memory processors, a `.network()` method that turns any agent into a routing agent, and server adapters to integrate Mastra within an existing Express/Hono server.(That last one took a bit of time, we went down the ESM/CJS bundling rabbithole, ran into lots of monorepo issues, and ultimately opted for a more explicit approach.)Anyway, we'd love for you to try Mastra out and let us know what you think. You can get started with `npm create mastra@latest`.We'll be around and happy to answer any questions!",

To me, an agent means anything with agency. After a couple weeks of frustration, I started using my own custom branching workflows.One reason to use rules, they are free and 10,000x faster, with an LLM agent fallback if validation rules were not passing.

The SunOS kernel, ZFS, zero install, immutable core, convenient way to manage containers and VMs together - all of this looked great on paper, especially containers.In reality, I ended up running almost everything in VMs. The only thing worked well natively was nginx. MongoDB, Mysql, even our php backend (some libraries) had issues, unfortunately.A year ago, I considered SmartOS again as a home lab driver, and no success again, Linux just has better support: drivers, pci passthrough, etc... and now with containers+vm through Proxmox or anything else. You can even run a k8s+kubevirt with zfs practically out of the box as a complete overkill though.",

Actually, years ago this machine was the very first server we set up when our company was just getting started and for the first few years it ran pretty much everything. Zones were ideal for that, also to allow us to pack more services on less hardware, while having decent separation and everything snapshotting/backupping using ZFS. Nowadays we have a bunch more servers, with varying *nix operating systems (SmartOS, Debian, FreeBSD), as well as macOS and even Windows for some specific CI functions. (:The global zone works great as a hypervisor if you prefer working over SSH in a real shell, and being able to run a lot of services natively just makes things like memory allocation to VM's and having a birds eye view of performance easier. Being able to CoW cp/mv files between zones because it's actually the same filesystem makes certain operations much easier than with actual VM's. Bhyve works well for the things that need an actual Linux kernel or other OS, at the cost of losing some of the zone benefits mentioned earlier.Highlighting a few things we today run on SmartOS, grouped by their technology stacks: C (haproxy, nginx, PostgreSQL, MariaDB), PHP (various web apps), Java (Keycloak), Elixir/Phoenix (Plausible, fork of Firezone), Rust (rathole, some internal glue services), Go (Grafana, Consul, Prometheus). Most of those are readily available in the package manager, and a few offer native Solaris binaries which run fine on illumos. Others we do local builds in a utility zone before copying the binary package to the where it actually runs.On LX zones we also run a number of services without problems, usually because they have Debian packaging available but are not in pkgsrc (for example Consul/Nomad, Fabio, some internal things that was already Linux-specific and we haven't bothered to port yet).And at home a LX zone also runs Jellyfin just fine.

(Qubes can also do Windows vms and they amped up support for this in the latest release, while smartOS has native zones and i believe you can do freebsd and maybe others on bhyve.)Differences are many, including that Qubes has no concept of a \"native\" VM (dom0 is just a thin fedora wrapper around Xen) and that the global zone in SmartOS is significantly beefier than dom0 in Qubes, since Qubes offloads networking and usb io and bluetooth and sound to independent service qubes (VMs).

(you could maybe handwave at pipelining or speculative execution making it irrelevant or wasted regardless, but no sign of those arguments).The library seems good and always extremely nice when people produce write ups like this, but it might just be they're out over their skis when it comes to what was actually important about their optimizations.",
