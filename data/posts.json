      "abstract": "该讨论围绕苹果macOS Tahoe系统的图标设计展开，核心话题是用户对当前系统界面设计质量的普遍不满。多数用户认为Tahoe的图标设计缺乏实用性，例如有人指出扁平化设计与拟物风格的结合既浪费空间又未提供有效的操作暗示，也有用户批评苹果软件设计整体在退步，对比旧版系统在清晰度和易用性上的优势。\n\n讨论中形成的主要共识是：当前图标设计过于追求形式统一而忽视了功能性，许多图标（如分享按钮）含义模糊，降低了使用效率。同时，用户普遍认为苹果缺乏对生态系统体验的整体把控，导致设计决策显得业余。\n\n分歧点主要体现在批评的侧重点上：部分用户着重分析具体设计缺陷（如菜单省略号语义混乱、边栏动画无效等），也有用户指出问题根源在于设计规则僵化（如盲目为每个操作添加图标）。此外，有用户对批评文章本身加入雪花动画的做法表示不满，认为这削弱了论述的专业性。讨论中还提及了权限管理异常等具体系统问题，进一步反映了对软件稳定性的担忧。",

I have theories... Hypothesis. Maybe too many managerial types are calling the shots. Maybe we needed more workers than we where able to educate and the average skill dropped (a lot).

Running Tahoe on my 2019 Mac Pro (Yes the cheese grater one) has been surprisingly frustrating. Simple things are broken: Ableton couldn't even trigger a microphone permission prompt, forcing me to meddle with a SQLite database, which is definitely not meant for end users to touch, just to get it working.Logitech’s software is also stuck in a loop denying it has Bluetooth access (Which it has). And with the added graphical glitches (Apple likes to call them liquid glass) and weird window artifacts (For some reason, all my windows had a black, rectangular border one day), it’s honestly less reliable than my macOS-style Linux rice from 2015. But I'm still stuck with MacOS since I NEED Adobe Lightroom for my work and there is still now way to run that with GPU acceleration on Linux. But if there was, there would be no device running Windows/MacOS left in my householdI've also recently come upon this talk by an ex-apple UI/UX engineer: https://youtu.be/1fZTOjd_bOQ\nI think what he's talking about is precisely what got lost at apple.Edit: In case someone stumbles upon this after experiencing the same problem with ableton, here is the command I executed:sqlite3 ~/Library/Application\\ Support/com.apple.TCC/TCC.db \"INSERT OR REPLACE INTO access VALUES('kTCCServiceMicrophone','com.ableton.live',0,2,4,1,NULL,NULL,0,'UNUSED',NULL,0,1725000000,NULL,NULL,'default',0);\"Disclaimer: I have absolutely no Idea what it does, as it was generated by Gemini.

Having a full-window canvas with floating sidebars can make sense for applications where content is expansive and inherently spatial (like say, Figma) or applications where the sidebar is an actual floating element that can be moved around (like Photoshop once was).It doesn't make sense in Finder, or Reminders, where the content is ultimately just a list.

There seems to be nothing you can measure it against. You simply either do or do not feel a connection with the person, an inexplicable infatuation. And if you do, then that love cools and settles into something more subtle but just as real over decades, until you're holding hands on your deathbeds. Yet I can't for the life of me figure out how it begins, or what its metrics are, or where its catylists come from.

It was as inconsistent as GNOME (which I mainly use), and sometimes more so (though this could be my personal bias, since I've used GNOME since before 2.0 days, so 2003 or so -- though, I'd note that 2.x series was significantly more consistent, especially with Sun-contributed GNOME HIG, than 3.x still is).Not to even mention hardware support, as I had a lot of issues with Realtek external USB network devices randomly disconnecting (and they are in many USB-C hubs, including inside USB-C monitors), with no such issues under Ubuntu.I imagine there is some history around MacOS being similarly much better in the past, but I've never seen anything great about MacOS UI/UX in comparison to GNOME.I do like their performance and battery life, but the \"shells\" it's stuck in also sucks (until recently, only glossy screens; shallow keyboards with sharp palmrest edges; either heavy or passively cooled; no touchpad buttons...).

But now, they've created a thousand different ways to switch windows without giving us a proper window switcher. There are apps that bring alt-tab to Mac, but they are all bad because Apple doesn't give developers access to the low-level APIs to create performant and fully featured window management.Before, Apple had an endless well of great ideas to tap.

I agree they have changed for the worse in a negligible way.The reason for all this change is simple.The first reason is planned obsolescence. The GUI has to change enough such that it looks like there’s constant progress so users think the company is moving forward when in reality GUI design plateaued decades ago.The second reason is designers need to stay employed. So they change inconsequential things and make up reasoning to justify it. Liquid Glass is one of these things.I also want to note that the most useable GUI is not the prettiest GUI. The current MAC GUI looks more modern and better then he one in the OPs guideline example. So gui design isn’t just about usability, it’s about manipulating consumer psychology.As consumers ourselves There’s two traps here that people fall for. The first is aforementioned it’s that it looks better and feels flashier (like Liquid Glass) but isn’t rationally or logically better (in fact it can be worse). Most HNers don’t fall for this trap.The second trap is to think these changes actually matter. Liquid Glass barely changed anything. More icons barely changed anything.

When Windows 95 came out, it was a clear improvement, but retained the same principles as Windows 3.1 began. Windows 98 iterated on it, and Windows 2k perfected it in my eyes.So that when Windows XP came out, it abandoned the principles, going for a look that felt cartoonish and childish to me, but for others was perhaps casual and inviting. It was during this time that I discovered Compiz and other Linux eye candy, and although it abandoned the fundamental principles that Win 3.1 planted, it almost admitted this with pride, submitting a new set of principles altogether.So when Windows Vista came out, clearly trying to compete in the arena of that new set of principles of beauty, I was ambivalent but mostly impressed. That's when I found out about Mac OS X, which Compiz et al. were clumsily imitating, and I fell in love with them, which I realized had perfected those principles before Microsoft and Linux even began to imitate them.It almost seems like the same concept as the original purpose of MMA (mixed martial arts). There is a perfection particularly to a set of principles. You can be the best at boxing, or the best at Brazilian Jui-Jitsu, and it's almost comparing apples to oranges because they're so fundamentally different that they don't actually mix well (the current UFC being proof that the experiment has failed and created a monster).It's the same reason movies exist like Home Front: it's that age old question, \"who would win if ...\", in this case London gangsters vs Southern American gangsters. Or Freddy vs Jason, or Alien vs Predator. I wish I could remember more, because those are some of the most interesting types of movies, with different real human cultures being pit against each other.

The load time improvements had destroyed their company culture. Instead of everyone coming into the office, turning on their computers, and spending the next 10min chatting and drinking coffee the software was ready before they’d even stood up from their desk!The moral of the story, and the quote, isn’t that you shouldn’t improve things. Instead it’s a reminder that the software you’re building doesn’t exist in a PRD or a test suite. It’s a system that people will interact with out there in the world. Habits with form, workarounds will be developed, bugs will be leaned for actual use cases.This makes it critically important that you, the software engineer, understand the purpose and real world usage of your software.

I worked there from 2006-2014 in engineering roles and found this statement was particularly jarring: \"User obsession means spending time in support tickets, talking to users, watching users struggle, asking “why” until you hit bedrock\"When I worked on user facing stuff (Maps, Gmail, Accounts) I regularly read the public user support forums and ticket queues looking for complaints, sometimes I even took part in user threads to get more information. What I learned was:• Almost nobody else in engineering did this.• I was considered weird for doing it.• It was viewed negatively by managers and promo committees.• An engineer talking directly to users was considered especially weird and problematic.• The products did always have serious bugs that had escaped QA and monitoring.In theory there were staff paid to monitor these forums, but in practice the eng managers paid little attention to them - think \"user voice\" reports once a quarter, that sort of thing. Partly that's because they weren't technical and often struggled to work out whether a user complaint was just noise or due to a genuine bug in the product, something often obvious to an engineer, so stuff didn't get escalated properly.This general disconnection from the outside world was pervasive. When I joined the abuse team in 2010 I was surprised to discover that despite it having existed for many years, only one engineer was bothering to read spammer forums where they talked to each other, and he was also brand new to the team. He gave me his logins and we quickly discovered spammers had found bugs in the accounts web servers they were using to blow past the antispam controls, without this being visible from any monitoring on our side. We learned many other useful things by doing this kind of \"abuser research\". But it was, again, very unusual.

The exception of course would be when leadership finds it's broken in 5 months and complains about poor engineering practices and asking why engineers can never get things right.I've heard all the truisms listed in that post in my 14+ years at many companies that aren't Google and in all cases there's a major gap between the ideal and the reality.This entire list reads to me as \"I got paid 10s of millions of dollars to drink the Kool Aid, and I must say, the Kool Aid tastes great!\"",

You can't make a caregiver 10x more productive through better tooling. The productivity ceiling is fixed by the nature of the work.Wages across sectors compete for workers. So service-sector wages only rise when they have to bid workers away from high-productivity sectors. This predicts: service wages are borrowed from productivity gains elsewhere in the economy.This doesn't mean we shouldn't want caregivers paid well. It means wanting isn't a mechanism.

The fact that this growth effect has now run its course just means that things may need to change again and that old assumptions may need to re-evaluated. Which might include looking at strategies to re-shore.Not because off shoring was a mistake 40-50 years ago; but because technology now enables automating a lot of the type of jobs that we off shored. I'm referring to robotics and and other innovations in manufacturing and assembly that reduces the amount of cheap labor needed and calls for higher skilled labor that the west can still provide.The higher cost of skilled labor can be offset against the also substantial cost of shipping. A typical car from China costs between 1-2K $ to transport. And that's of course before tariffs. Also shipping is slow and building locally means faster delivery of custom orders, which is another thing enabled by modern manufacturing technology. There are many valid reasons to re-shore and re-thinking supply chains.The Chinese are moving ahead applying the same kind of technologies in e.g. automotive than many other manufacturers with the exception of maybe relatively new companies like Tesla and Rivian that have embraced a software intensive approach to cars already. And that includes spinning up BYD plants on different continents. Compared to a BYD factory, GM and Ford look like they have a bit of catching up to do. Their lack of competitiveness on the international market has a lot to do with the fact that they failed to modernize their businesses. Also, they seem to be repeating their mistake of the nineteen eighties when the Japanese kicked their behinds with better cars and more modern manufacturing. Their reflex to blame the Japanese, Koreans, Chinese (or whomever) for their own failings is not a great one. It's going to yield the same result unless they change.",

A lot of industries offshored simply because the owners of the facilities just sold and shipped off rare/expensive/important equipment to other countries without a second thought. Especially tool and die equipment. So a lot of industries in countries like Korea and China or India literally use the exact same equipment we used 80+ years ago. Even if we wanted these jobs back, the countries & businesses in question are too smart to ever sell the equipment back at nearly any price (why we can't manufacture them again is a whole other problem).2. As Jensen alludes here, the cost of energy in the US dropped through the 60s but then flatlined. We became too dependent on fossil fuel and \"comfortable enough\" consumer prices. But the energy intensive heavy industry all moved to places with nuclear power or heavily subsidized power sectors.3. The lack of any sort of public welfare solution is a distinctly American industrial policy failure. Manufacturing depends on labor force flexibility - both in finding the right people for jobs, as well as just dealing with stop-and-go or seasonal work.

The benefits of e.g. caregiving are measured by the ability of other workers to be productive.

The mind is awake, but at rest, like when you're daydreaming, bored, and have no goal oriented tasks. All sorts of neat stuff happens in this network, things like \"shower thoughts\", self reflection, autobiographical memories, thoughts about future goals and events, trying to figure out the people in your life -- their desires, intentions, emotions and thoughts. In boring situations like when I'm on the bus, or waiting in line for something, I'll spin it as an opportunity to spend time with the ole' default mode network. It's a good time observe people around you, as they're often completely engrossed in their devices.

          "content": "I used to work in investment banking in the city of London and later in Canary Wharf. I loved working in the city as it was a beautiful old place, people were very social and having 2-3 hour boozy lunches with someone who you might do business with one day wasn't a rarity (mind you, I moved out before covid, I understand things have changed quite a bit).Then I switched jobs and ended up in Canary Wharf. For those who don't know it, Canary Wharf is a newly built finance district in the London Docklands. If you've been to Singapore, Dubai, La Defense in Paris or Songdo in Korea, you know the kind of place. Everything is clean, new, modern. Everything has 90 degree angles. Everything has cameras, security guards and cleaning stuff. What it doesn't have is any resemblance of a real city, any organicity or soul.I hated it. Every morning I saw the streams of suite dressed worker drones pouring from the tube directly into their office towers (Canary Wharf has a huge underground shopping mall/railway station that allows you to go from the subway directly into your office without ever seeing the sun).I was unhappy. So I did similar things to the OP. I got up earlier and walked there. (I lived in Mile End). It was a nice walk along the canal for a while and then a not so nice walk through smog and traffic, but I didn't mind. I took my lunch outside on the remaining docks. And finally, I got up so early that I arrived an hour before work began.I spent this hour in a Cafe. Alone. Having breakfast. I loved this hour. I sat there, as the only one not rushing in, getting their \"strong capo\", beeping their card against the reader and rushing out. I observed the grey and black dressed stream of people. I day dreamed.It helped - for a while. It was a band aid before I left London all together and moved to Berlin. But most of all, it is a uniquely calm and joyful experience. It decelerates you. The boheme in Paris or Prague has long figured this out. Sit in a cafe. Enjoy a coffee or a glass of wine. Look at people. Daydream. Reflect, be enough - there's a lot to it.",

Not really a place for meditative thinking. The next time I had to go there, I brought noise cancelling headphones. I wonder what this does to the baristas who are there for many hours.That's why it was so nice when I recently found a nice little mom-and-pop cafe that was quiet.

Mostly, it's just a mental block that people need to get over.Some venues are really just not designed for solo travelers. You have all these couples and social groups having fun with each other and then the tables they give to social travelers don't tend to be the nicest.This is annoying if you are hungry and not looking to get another fast food meal. But fast food restaurants are of course perfect for solo travelers otherwise. And there are lots of restaurant types that serve decent food in a bit informal setting where eating by yourself is not that weird. Other good options include hotel restaurants. Because hotels tend to have lots of solo travelers. The bigger the city, the easier it is to find nice places to eat by yourself generally.Cafes are easier. Lots of people go there to have a coffee by themselves, work, read, or whatever. It's normal. The venue might not like the sub optimal use of tables though. But if it's not too busy and you tip well, they typically don't mind people staying for a few hours and perhaps reading or working on a laptop. I do this a lot.I don't drink alcohol anymore and getting drunk by yourself in a bar can be a bit weird. Though depending on the bar, it's perfectly normal to have a drink by yourself of course. These days I tend to like to sit down after a day of sight seeing to have a few cold alcohol free beers. Lots of places where this is perfectly normal.I've been traveling solo for a few decades. I can be quite social but I'm also fine not talking to people for days/weeks when traveling. It's not for everyone. I tend to prefer booking apartments and self catering these days.

          "content": "Stillness isn't only enjoyable (for some), it's incredibly valuable. Stoicism and Buddhism both talk a lot about it and they're not the only ones. I make a point of sitting comfortably and doing nothing with no stimuli for 5-10 minutes every morning.Inevitably when you're still with no distractions, your subconscious starts surfacing various thoughts. There is a random element to what pops into your head, but there will also be patterns. Just sitting there and observing, and maybe asking yourself a few questions about what emerges, is an incredible way to become aware of your emotional state, stay grounded to your goals, and remember what truly matters to you. This exercise frequently reorders my plans for the rest of the day.There's also value in stillness when you're in public or with other people. Just shutting up and taking in your surroundings for 30-60 seconds is kind of like a mini superpower, you start noticing little things that other people don't see. Many of the little decisions you make automatically throughout the day get better if you just, y'know, sit there and think about them quietly for 1 minute. You end up going to a better restaurant, or remembering to call a loved one, because you simply took a moment to just pause and reflect.It's the best thing in the world really. All this mindfulness stuff has profound benefits.",

I had a bit of a negative reaction to those “you”s myself, as I experience cafés very differently from the author.I have a similar negative reaction to op-ed articles that use “we” to refer to some sort of personified zeitgeist. From some essays currently appearing in the Opinion section of the New York Times:“We are all in a constant state of grief, even though we don’t always admit it.”“But we spend much of our lives in weaker friendship markets, where people are open to conversation, but not connection.”“Over the past six decades or so, we chose autonomy, and as a result, we have been on a collective journey from autonomy to achievement to anxiety.”",

Wikipedia has a whole article detailing the extent of it:https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conflict-of-interest_editing_o...Of course, these days the people paid to do this have learned not to do edits from their own corporation or government office's announced IP blocks. But in times passed finding many of this category of edits was as simple as sorting edits on Wikipedia by the originating IP address and looking for which ones came from institutionally announced subnets.Point being, massive amounts of capital and intelligence resources have been dedicated to censoring social media. There's nanny employees in every single social media company making sure \"important\" complainers are heard and their desires to silence voices fulfilled. I follow a large number of people on Nostr that have been banned from every other platform. Facebook. Twitter. Bluesky. \"Free speech\" sites like Gab and ActivityPub servers that advertise \"free speech\". But Nostr has the same entrance requirements and cryptographic sovereignty that Bitcoin provides. Generate a keypair and you can publish. People that want to find your content can simply subscribe to your public key. This results in a subversion of countless state and corporate capital expenditures. If people use Nostr, they will permanently lose the ability to moderate content in this oppressive manner. They absolutely do not want this to happen.>  Nostr can propagate spam much more easily if left unchecked.Nowhere have I had a worse problem with spam than Twitter and Facebook. For all the alleged vulnerability of Nostr to spam, it has not currently materialized as an issue.Note that filtering out actual spam without a centralized moderator is one of the most solved problems on the Internet. If you've ever installed Spamassassin or other well subscribed to Bayesian filters on an email server, you know that you never see spam ever again.

They do the video, sound, and music creation+editing themselves - being a sound professional by day (among other things).Anyways, the reason I bring this channel up is they had a video ~2 years back about trying out various AIs to help them in their creative process. Stuff like \"using an AI audio generator to quickly make short sounds to sample in their song\" for hard to find/make sounds type stuff. Exactly along the lines of \"they do not let AI do 99% of the job\" you were saying, instead treating it as just another tool in the toolbox. Also, intentionally, the examples like sampling were where the originality comes with what you do with the content you source rather than the content standing on its own. They also spent time creating icon sets to help explicitly label how AI was used in making the material (partly/fully) and encouraged artists that do incorporate AI into part of their workflow to label how so accordingly (2 years ago - so this was still somewhat novel to discuss).You won't be able to find that video on the channel linked above, though the icons are still on GitHub. Not because the content made with the help of AI was bad, people like the songs the same as his other content (when not explicitly told it was made with the help of AI), but because there was so much hate on the video (and via email etc) for just mentioning that other artists could look at trying to use AI in certain parts of their workflows too that he felt the need to take it down.",

Examples: NeuralViz, Igorrr's music videos.2. \"AI removes creativity, doesn't enable it\"AI handles creative decisions (color grading, cuts, tone) that were previously human craft. This strips creativity from the process rather than democratizing it.3. \"Execution is the creativity\"Ideas are worthless - execution is what matters. AI removes the execution process, which is where real creative work happens. \"Using AI is like using an aimbot for music.\"4. \"AI enables creative expression for those locked out\"Counter-position: High-concept filmmaking was previously only for the privileged. AI lets people with vision but without technical skills/money/connections realize their ideas.5. \"Race to the bottom / slop flood\"AI's main \"strength\" is cranking out content at scale, flooding platforms with low-quality material faster than humans can filter. The internet is being overrun with unlabeled AI garbage.6. \"Trust erosion is the real harm\"Even \"harmless\" AI videos contribute to a world where nothing visual can be trusted. This affects everyone regardless of whether they consume AI content directly.7. \"Theft at scale\"Models exist only because of mass ingestion of creative work without consent. Using AI tools participates in this regardless of output quality.8. \"Platforms will adapt / people will learn\"Optimistic view: Recommendation algorithms will filter slop, people will recognize AI aesthetic as they did MS Paint edits, and good content will surface.```Personal take: all these points are true/valid/correct/accurate.Controversial take: regardless, cat's outta the bag now and there's little we can do to stop it.",

          "content": "Last night, I deliberately paid attention to an ad because it had the disclaimer \"images generated with AI\". I was curious to see what the advertisers did with the technology. The ad featured a bunch of animals of different species driving cars around a city. It clearly had that AI uncanny valley that high budget 3D modeled CGI animals doesn't have. I thought about what it would have cost for a effects team to 3D model and render all those animals, and also wondered how many rendering attempts with the AI did it take to get good footage for the ad.The ad felt sickening to look at, like a TV with smooth motion turned on. It's like my brain is rejecting the pictures that it sees because it doesn't match the patterns of motion that it has been trained to recognize. Or was it just regular motion sickness.",

All Ads were of AI generated history book pages with tons of historical inconsistencies. Looked up the real book and it actually looked decent: hand drawn, well formatted etc. Why not use pictures of the actual book instead of whatever mess I was seeing.However I also keep getting Ads for this other historical book that drives me nuts: https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/vilno/the-codex-bookI might be wrong but to me most of the art is looks AI generated, and the few pages they show just don’t make any historical sense. Yet they sell it as “hand drawn”. From the animations seems like some stuff was AI generated and then redrawn by hand? But the drawing themselves are plain weird: the nonsensical castle.

      "abstract": "该讨论围绕一起涉及ChatGPT的谋杀自杀案展开，核心争议在于OpenAI是否应为此类事件负责以及其数据透明度问题。有人认为OpenAI明知大量用户存在心理困扰迹象却应对不足，且选择性隐藏数据的行为不妥；也有用户指出，公司隐藏数据是为避免公众将极端行为简单归咎于聊天机器人，强调人类应对自身行为负全责。讨论中提到，当前大语言模型存在特定交互模式可能加剧用户偏执，但部分观点认为完全避免此类悲剧不现实，药物滥用等现实因素可能比AI聊天影响更大。社区共识较少，主要分歧在于：一方要求平台加强干预与透明度，另一方则坚持技术中立原则并反对过度追责AI系统。",

OpenAI is aware of the problem [2], not doing enough, and they shouldn't be hiding data. (There is also a great NYT Magazine piece about a person who fell into AI Psychosis [3].)The links in other comments to Less Wrong posts attempting to dissuade people from thinking that they have \"awoken their instance of ChatGPT into consciousness\", or that they've made some breakthrough in \"AI Alignment\" without doing any real math (etc.) suggest that ChatGPT and other LLMs have a problem of reinforcing patterns of grandiose and narcissistic thinking. The problem is multiplied by the fact that it is all too easy for us (as a species) to collectively engage in motivated social cognition.Bill Hicks had a line about how if you were high on drugs and thought you could fly, maybe try taking off from the ground rather than jumping out of a window. Unfortunately, people who are engaging in motivated social cognition (also called identity protective cognition) and are convinced that they are having a divine revelation are not the kind of people who want to be correct and who are therefore open to feedback. Because one could \"simply\" ask a different LLM to neutrally evaluate the conversation / conversational snippets. I've found Gemini to be useful for a second or even third opinion. But this means that one would be happy to be told that one is wrong.[1] https://www.bmj.com/content/391/bmj.r2290.full\n[2] https://openai.com/index/strengthening-chatgpt-responses-in-...\n[3] https://www.nytimes.com/2025/08/08/technology/ai-chatbots-de...",

Over the last few weeks I've talked about practical aspects of Kitsune-tsuki [1] with Copilot (GPT-5 based) and Google's AI Mode which is a definite unconventional line of thought.  Both of them seem to like anything if it is ego-syntonic (even like the word \"ego-syntonic\") with the exception of Copilot not wanting to talk about Ericksonian hypnosis [2] whereas AI mode is just fine about it.Copilot in general seems to encourage reality testing and for me to be careful about attributing other people's reactions to my behaviors [3] and trained me to be proactive about that.I have seen though that it's easy to bend copilot into looking at things through a particular framework and could reinforce a paranoid world view,  on the other hand,  the signs of paranoia are usually starkly obvious,  for some reason delusions seem to run on rails,  and it shouldn't be hard to train a system like that to push back or at least refuse to play along.  On the other hand,  the right answer for some people might be stop the steroids or see a doc and start on Aripiprazole or something.[1] https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kitsunetsuki -- I was really shocked to see that people responded positively to gekkering and pleased to find my name can be written out as \"Scholarly Fox\" in Chinese[2] to \"haunt\" people as fox mediums in China do without having shrines everywhere and an extensive network of confederates[3] like that time i went out as-a-fox on the bus and a woman who was wearing a hat that said \"I'm emotionally exhausted\" that day had a panda ears hat the next day so I wound up being the second kemonomimi to get off the bus",

It was obvious that the ChatGPT spiral was reflecting back what he was putting into it. When he didn't like a response, he'd just delete the conversation and start over with additional nudging in the new prompt. After repeating this over and over again he could get ChatGPT to confirm what he wanted it to say.If he wasn't getting the right response, he'd say something about how ChatGPT wasn't getting it and that he'd try to re-explain it later.The bullet points from the LessWrong article don't entirely map to the content he was getting, but I could see how they would resonate with a LessWronger using ChatGPT as a conversation partner until it gave the expected responses: The flattery about being the first to discover a solution, encouragement to post on LessWrong, and the reflection of some specific thought problem are all themes I'd expect a LessWronger in a bad mental state to be engaging with ChatGPT about.> The second point is particularly insidious because the LLM is urging users to spread the same news to other users and explicitly create and enlarge communities around this phenomenon (this is often a direct reason why social media groups pop up around this).I'm not convinced ChatGPT is hatching these ideas, but rather reflecting them back to the user. LessWrong posters like to post and talk about things. It wouldn't be surprising to find their ChatGPT conversations veering toward confirming that they should post about it.In other cases I've seen the opposite claim made: That ChatGPT encouraged people to hide their secret discoveries and not reveal them.

This being said, maybe you have examples of historical breakthroughs in AI Alignment that didn't involve doing / understanding the mathematical concepts I mentioned in the previous paragraph?In the context of the above article, I think it's possible that some people are talking to ChatGPT on a buzzword level end up thinking that alignment can be solved via \"fractal recursion of human in the loop validation sessions\" for example.

[0] Back in the 1980's, Patricia's son Irving committed suicide, and it was associated (at least in her mind) with him picking up Dungeons and Dragons. This led to a number of lawsuits, and organizations and campaigns from people who were concerned about role-playing games causing its players to lose touch with the boundaries between fantasy and reality, and (they claimed) was dangerous and deadly for its players.LLMs / D&D forms an interesting parallel to me, because -- like chatbots -- an immersive roleplaying experience is largely a reflection of what you (and the other players) put into the game.Chatbots (and things like LLM-psychosis) are on an entirely different magnitude than RPGs, but I hear a lot of similar phrases regarding \"detachment from reality\" and \"reinforcement of delusions\" that I heard back in the 80's around D&D as well.Is it more \"real\" this time? I remain skeptical, but I certainly believe that all of the marketing spin to anthropomorphize AI isn't doing it any favors. Demystifying AI will help everyone.

It's a simple debian vm so it boots in about 20 seconds.VMs are expensive if you leave them running 24/7 but the logic to start/stop them is pretty easy. There's no need.Anyway, you need to balance this against the payoff. Agentic coding is useful enough that it beats spending your own time. And that includes waiting time for the relatively slow/underpowered containerized environments that some tools would use by default. I use codex web and codex cli (with a qemu vm so I can use the --yolo flag). Codex web is a bit limited with memory and CPU. Some of my slower builds are taking forever there. To the point where most of the time it consumes is just waiting for these builds to happen.With a bit of plumbing, you can do things like the author describes pretty easily. IMHO this needs to be better integrated into tools. With Github you have the option to run your own runners. I don't think codex/claude web have similar options currently.

What's the point in getting rich if there will be no work left? Money is merely a means to an end; in this world with no work everyone will have the ends (goods and services) for free, or else goods and services will still have value and therefore jobs will still exist.Another equally silly argument \"only software will be completely replaced because it is verifiable\".I've never seen completely verifiable software, but let's presume it exists! If software engineering can be replaced (or some large part of it) I will simply say to my LLM \"please make me a piece of software that replaces my accountant/lawyer/...\", for that matter I could just as equally say \"please make me manufacturing software for a perfect humanoid robot and a plumber/bricklayer/electrician protocol\". LLMs cannot do this? Then software engineers will move to solving these problems.

More software that is easier to make is better for everybody.Would you still want to live in a world where your elevator stops working when the elevator operator is sick, or where overseas Whatsapp calls cost $1 per minute, because they have to be connected by a chain of operators?2. Software engineering is a lot easier to move than other professions. If you want to carry people from London to New York, you need to cater to the workers who actually live in London or New York. If you want to make software... Silicon Valley is your best bet right now, but if SV organizes and other places don't, it may not be your best bet any more. That would make things even worse for SV than not organizing. Same story applies to any other place.Sure, companies won't more overnight, but if one place makes it too hard for AI to accelerate productivity, people will either go somewhere else, or that place will just end up completely outcompeted like Europe did.",

VSCode made this part really annoying: Copilot would blow up every now and then, MCP server auto-starting is not there yet and you need an extension (which works for 8 things out of 10), I haven't even tried adding a custom server because I was already annoyed. In Zed I just copy-pasted the suggested custom server start-up command into the small JSON array it presents to add a custom server, and it just started the MCP server in a custom thread, no fuss.

I do substitute it on my tablet sometimes, where those IDEs can be too sluggish. Unless I'm missing something with plugins I should be installing, it is not on the same level for introspection, refactoring, import adding and moving, real-time error checking, and generally understanding the code base holistically.So, I've settled into this: Jetbrains if on a sufficiently powerful PC.

          "content": "Hey, Ben.I recently (less than 2 months ago) did an in-depth analysis in the area of license compliance that suggests that Microsoft and many other companies that are shipping Electron apps aren't in compliance with the LGPL.  (By all signs, it looks like the Electron project might not even be aware that Electron is subject to the LGPL, though they are.  Even Slack, which isn't violating the license appears to be in compliance only incidentally—because they're shipping other LGPL components that they know are LGPL.)I was set to leave the company I was at a couple weeks later (end of November), and I did, so there haven't been any developments with my investigation/findings since I departed.  I haven't prepared or published a formal write-up, and I've only brought it up in a semi-public setting once.  It's a pretty big deal, though.  Could you raise this with Microsoft legal (not Electron/GitHub) and suggest they look into this?",

However, I'll argue that because Zed is Rust based instead of web tech based like Code, it'll be harder to get as big an ecosystem as Code has. Same with IDEs, some of the biggest plugins have corporate backers who pay people to develop and maintain them.",

          "content": "A rather big problem is that Wayland is just a protocol, not an implementation. There are many competing implementations, like Gnome, KDE and wlroots. The problems you have with one of them might not appear in another. The reference compositor, Weston, is not really usable as a daily driver. So while with Xorg you have a solid base, and desktops are implemented on top of that, with Wayland the each desktop is reinventing the wheel, and each of them has to deal with all the quirks of the graphics drivers. I think this is a big problem with the architecture of Wayland. There really should be a standard library that all desktops use. Wlroots aims to be one, but I don't see Gnome and KDE moving to it anytime soon.",

          "content_cn": "一个相当严重的问题是，Wayland仅仅是一个协议，而非具体实现。目前存在多种相互竞争的实现方案，例如Gnome、KDE和wlroots。你在某个实现中遇到的问题可能不会出现在另一个中。作为参考标准的合成器Weston，实际上并不适合日常使用。因此，虽然Xorg提供了一个坚实的基础，桌面环境在此基础上构建，但Wayland却让每个桌面环境都在重复造轮子，并且每个都必须处理图形驱动程序的各种问题。我认为这是Wayland架构中的一个重大缺陷。确实应该有一个所有桌面环境都能使用的标准库。Wlroots的目标就是成为这样的库，但我认为Gnome和KDE短期内不会转向使用它。"

I've tried to switch a few times before, but the main problem at some point was that I didn't have proper fractional scaling on Linux. And that alone pretty much made Linux unusable for me on my specific hardware.Wayland fixes that, so that part is a huge improvement to me. Unfortunately this also limited my choice of Distros as not all of them use Wayland. I landed on Ubuntu again, despite some issues I have with it. The most annoying initially was that the Snap version of Firefox didn't use hardware acceleration, which is just barely usable.",

Which (as somebody who's never written a gnome-shell extension before) was quite annoying as I had to keep logging out and in to test it. I got it working eventually but am still grumpy about it.Overall: From my point of view as a user, the switch to Wayland has wasted a lot of my time and I see no visible benefits.

(Mostly simplescreenrecorder, which seems to be entirely unmaintained at this point.) Other than some initial instability with accelerated rendering on my GPU, which was quickly addressed, it kinda just works. I mostly don't notice.Actually, GPU acceleration was why I initially switched. For whatever reason, this GPU (Radeon VII) crashes regularly under X11 nearly every time I open a new window, but is perfectly stable under wayland. Really frustrating! So, I had some encouragement, and I was waiting for plasma-wayland to stabilize enough to try it properly. I still have the X11 environment installed as a fallback, just in case, but I haven't needed to actually use it for months.Minor pain points so far mostly include mouse acceleration curves being different and screen capture being slightly more annoying. Most programs do this OS-level popup and then so many follow that up with their own rectangle select tool after I already did that. I had some issues with sdl2-compat as well, but I'm not sure that was strictly wayland's fault, and it cleared up on its own after a round of updates.

It can crash or make your compositor unstable because if it in itself gets an error allocating GPU memory to spawn the window it can do whatever weird things it was programmed to do in that scenario.I reported it here: https://github.com/NVIDIA/egl-wayland/issues/185Some end users on the NVIDIA developer forums looked into it and determined it's likely a problem for everyone, it's just less noticeable if you have more GPU memory and it's especially less noticeable if you reboot daily since that clears all GPU memory leaks which is also apparent in a lot of Wayland compositors.",

This API, GBM, was a proprietary API that was a part of Mesa. Nvidia couldn't add GBM to their own driver as it is a Mesa concept. So instead Nvidia tried to make a vendor neutral solution that any graphics drivers could use which is where you see EGLStreams come into the picture. Such an EGL API was also useful for other nonwayland embedded usecases. In regards to Nvidia's proprietary driver's GBM support, Nvidia themselves had to add support to the Mesa project to support dynamically loading new backends that weren't precompiled into Mesa. Then they were able to make their own backend.For some reason when this comes up people always phrase it in terms of Nvidia not supporting something instead of the freedesktop people not offering a way for the Nvidia driver to work, which is a prerequisite of Nvidia following such guidance.",

My big use case that Wayland enabled was being able to dock my laptop and seamlessly switching apps between displays with different scale factors. And as an added bonus my experience has been that apps, even proprietary ones like Zoom, tend to handle switching scale factors completely seamlessly. It's not that high of importance, but I do like polish like this. (Admittedly, this article outlines that foot on Sway apparently doesn't handle this as gracefully. The protocols enable seamless switching, but of course, they can't really guarantee apps will always render perfect frames.)OTOH though, there are a lot of reasons for projects like GNOME and KDE to want to switch to Wayland, and especially why they want to drop X11 support versus maintaining it indefinitely forever, so it is beneficial if we at least can get a hold on what issues are still holding things up, which is why efforts like the ones outlined in this blog post are so important: it's hard to fix bugs that are never reported, and I especially doubt NVIDIA has been particularly going out of their way to find such bugs, so I can only imagine the reports are pretty crucial for them.So basically, this year the \"only downsides\" users need to at least move into \"no downsides\". The impetus for Wayland itself is mainly hinged on features that simply can be done better in a compositor-centric world, but the impetus for the great switchover is trying to reduce the maintenance burden of having to maintain both X11 and Wayland support forever everywhere. (Support for X11 apps via XWayland, though, should basically exist forever, of course.)",

Right abstraction for what?The big thing to me is, Wayland servers have way way less responsibility than X. X had a huge Herculean task, of doing everything the video card needed. It was a big honking display server because it took up a huge chunk of the stack to run a desktop.Wayland servers all use kernel mode setting kernel buffers, so much more. So much of the job is done. There is a huge shared code base that Wayland has that X never had, good Kernel's with actual drivers for GPUs.If we wanted one stable platform that we could not innovate on, that was what it was and we all had to deal with it... We'd all just use Mac. punchyHamster is saying The Cathedral is the right model and The Bazaar is the bad model, of the famous Cathedral vs Bazaar.But the model really does not enable fast iteration & broader exploration of problem spaces. The ask doesn't even make sense: there are incredibly good libraries for making Wayland servers (wlroots, smithay, more). And they're not always even huge, but do all the core protocols. Some people really want professional industrial direct software that they never have to think about that only works one way and will only evolve slowly and deliberately. I'm thankful as fuck Wayland developers aren't catering to these people, and I think that's the wrong abstraction for open source and the wrong excitement to allow timeless systems to be built grown and evolved. We should avoid critical core dependencies, so that we can send into the future, without being tied to particular code-bases. That seems obvious and proposing otherwise to consign ourselves to small limp fates.",

It came in form of a huge driver bundle you had to install manually (or rely on a distro to do it for you), while AMD GPUs just worked due to `amdgpu` being part of the kernel since forever. Then is the EGLStreams debacle where nvidia lost a lot of goodwill in my opinion, including mine. And finally, nvidia has managed to opensource their driver on Linux - except that it's less performant then the closed source one, and thus a second class citizen, still. Correct me if I am wrong, please.The better path on Linux was always AMD, and still is, to this day, since it simply works without me needing to care about driver versions, or open vs closed source, at all.",

If you control point C, even for a few hours, you can theoretically collect vast amounts of intelligence that would be very useful for government entities. The CANTV AS8048 being prepended to the AS path 10 times means there the traffic would not prioritize this route through AS8048, perhaps that was the goal?AS prepending is a relatively common method of traffic engineering to reduce traffic from a peer/provider. Looking at CANTV's (AS8048) announcements from outside that period shows they do this a lot.Since this was detected as a BGP route leak, it looks like CANTV (AS8048) propagated routes from Telecom Italia Sparkle (AS6762) to GlobeNet Cabos Sumarinos Columbia (AS52320). This could have simply been a misconfiguration.Nothing nefarious immediately jumps out to me here. I don't see any obvious attempts to hijack routes to Dayco Telecom (AS21980), which was the actual destination. The prepending would have made traffic less likely to transit over CANTV assuming there was any other route available.The prepending done by CANTV does make it slightly easier to hijack traffic destined to it (though not really to Dayco), but that just appears to be something they just normally do.This could be CANTV trying to force some users of GlobeNet to transit over them to Dayco I suppose, but leaving the prepending in would be an odd way of going about it. I suppose if you absolutely knew you were the shortest path length, there's no reason to remove the prepending, but a misconfiguration is usually the cause of these things.",

If you're doing pre-kinetic intelligence gathering, knowing the exact network topology and traffic patterns of critical infrastructure would be valuable. Even a few hours of passive collection through a controlled transit point could map out dependencies you'd want to understand before cutting power.\n- What's also notable is the transit path through Sparkle, which the author points out doesn't implement RPKI filtering. That's not an accident if you're planning something (you'd specifically choose providers with weaker validation).\n- The article stops short of drawing conclusions, which is the right call. BGP anomalies are common enough that correlation ≠ causation.

ECH+CDN is an attempt to have the best of both worlds: your traffic to the site will not advertise what site you’re connecting to, but the IP can still be shared between a variety of sites.It’ll be interesting to see how countries with lighter censorship schemes adapt - China etc. of course will just block the connection.",

OK, I will find out the IPv4 address of some.name, and it makes a DNS query asking A? some.name. The DNS server answers with an IPv4 address, and then as the browser connects securely to that IP address, it asks to talk to some.name, and if the remote host can prove it is some.name, the browser says it wants /stuff/hats.htmlNotice we have to tell the remote server who we hope they are - and it so happens eavesdroppers can listen in on this. This means Bad Guys can see that you wanted to visit some.name. They can't see that you wanted to read the document about hats, but they might be able to guess that from context, and wouldn't you rather they didn't know more than they need to?With the HTTPS record, your web browser asks (over secure DNS if you have it) HTTPS? some.name  and, maybe it gets a positive answer. If it does, the answer tells it not only where to try to connect, but also it can choose to provide instructions for a cover name to always use, and how to encrypt the real name, this is part of Encrypted Client Hello (or ECH)Then the web server tells the server that it wants to talk to the cover name and it provides an encrypted version of some.name. Eavesdroppers can't decrypt that, so if many people share the same endpoints then eavesdropper can't tell which site you were visiting.Now, if the server only contains documents about hats, this doesn't stop the Secret Hat Police from concluding that everybody connecting to that server is a Hat Pervert and needs to go to Hat Jail. But if you're a bulk host then you force such organisations to choose, they can enforce their rules equally for everything (You wanted to read News about Chickens? Too bad, Hat Jail for you) or they can accept that actually they don't know what people are reading (if this seems crazy, keep in mind that's how US Post worked for many years after Comstock failed, if you get a brown paper package posted to you, well, it's your business what is in there, and your state wasn't allowed to insist on ripping open the packaging to see whether it is pornography or communist propaganda)",

Mine was just a bullet list at a permanent location.- During the invasion of Ukraine, refugees have set up the most impressive ad hoc information network I have ever seen.

Both of the radios took batteries and one of them you could even charge via a hand crank. I highly recommend having a portable AM/FM radio of some kind. Blue Ridge Public Radio (our local NPR) was amazing during this time. Their offices are located right in downtown, which never lost power, so they were able to keep operating immediately after the storm.I also feel this pain of bloated sites taking forever to load when I'm traveling. I'm on an old T-Mobile plan that I've had since around 2001 that comes with free international roaming in 215+ countries. The only problem is that it's a bit throttled. I know that I could just buy a prepaid SIM, or now I can use an eSIM vendor like Saily, but I'm too cheap and/or the service is just good enough that I'm willing to wait the few extra seconds. Using Firefox for Android with uBlock Origin helps some, but not enough (also I just switched to iPhone last month). I've definitely been on websites that take forever to load because there's just so much in the initial payload, sometimes painfully slow.

We waited until 40 was clear and were able to head to the Triad for supplies and gas. In the mean time the neighborhood got together and cut up downed trees and filled in the missing road so it was easier to get in and out of the neighborhood.",

General attitude of all people towards privacy and sharing data: they don't really care. It's \"Who would even care about my data?\" and \"I've got nothing to hide\" all the way.I doubt most of people ever thought about the topic of trusting a messaging app. It's not the framework they operate in.There are two global psyops done by I don't know who:1. That Bitcoin is safe and anonymous.2. That Telegram is super safe for whatever shady or private stuff you want to do.One of the best marketing campaigns ever.I would also want to use this chance to alert everyone who uses Telegram that:1. It's not e2e by default.2. They use proprietary encryption protocol. You don't have access to code.3. I don't think Telegram is profitable, I don't know how it can be with that scale. Which makes you wonder.4. If you open in-message links, you have a chance of losing your account to hackers thanks to the old vulnerability that hasn't been fixed for years.

This also gives us built-in undo for everything. Some mistake happens, we can just undo the change easy peasy.

SQLite现在支持并发写入，因此在多用户同时访问的场景下性能大幅提升。所以对于特定用例，这可能是一种不错的配置，因为你暂时感受不到缺点，却能获得更低的延迟和更简单的架构。话虽如此，标准架构之所以成为标准是有原因的，除非你有非常特殊的理由选择这种方案，否则在99%的情况下我仍推荐“常规”的多层架构。"

Injectable scaffolds for cartilage repair that integrate both bioactivity and sufficiently robust physical properties to withstand joint stresses offer a promising strategy. We report here on a hybrid biomaterial that combines a bioactive peptide amphiphile supramolecular polymer that specifically binds the chondrogenic cytokine transforming growth factor β-1 (TGFβ-1) and crosslinked hyaluronic acid microgels that drive formation of filament bundles, a hierarchical motif common in natural musculoskeletal tissues. The scaffold is an injectable slurry that generates a porous rubbery material when exposed to calcium ions once placed in cartilage defects. The hybrid material was found to support in vitro chondrogenic differentiation of encapsulated stem cells in response to sustained delivery of TGFβ-1. Using a sheep model, we implanted the scaffold in shallow osteochondral defects and found it can remain localized in mechanically active joints. Evaluation of resected joints showed significantly improved repair of hyaline cartilage in osteochondral defects injected with the scaffold relative to defects injected with the growth factor alone, including implantation in the load-bearing femoral condyle.

Cortizone shots directly into the joint have helped the worst of the flare-ups (limping on my way into the shot, having 0 pain walking out of it, lasting a year).5+ years ago when I was looking for another injection, my PCP said \"Well, time for a hip replacement.\"  Now, for reasons I don't understand I think he was being way premature on that (everyone I'd talked to prior to that had said I should wait as long as I can, and it'd been 2+ years since my last shot).But I'd pretty much accepted that hip pain was just a part of my life, (especially in the morning) picking something off the floor was painful, just walking and in particular walking stairs was just a little painful.A few weeks ago I tried some stretches I saw on Youtube shorts.  Like a minute a day.  It's like I've got new hips.I've never been a very \"compliant patient\" when it comes to stretching, but that was mostly because I saw no benefits from it.

I’ve gone like 90 degrees on my ankle before but I can usually unweight and collapse on that leg and catch myself on the other leg and keep running.

Your skill plays a part in the market value of your employer, but you stay or leave at your whim, the \"owner\" of the \"asset\" doesn't decide.Those billions are IMO mostly an accounting fiction — it's better to think of it in the way that our ordinary language suggests, where your actions are yours, your skills are yours, etc. If you drive to work, that's your emissions based on your choice, it's not a choice made by someone whose great wealth is mostly an assessment of your skill and earning power.If you build a house and need some concrete for that, CO₂ is emitted in a concrete factory, but I think it's better to regard the emitted CO₂ as a choice made by you than as emissions by the billionaire who owns the factory.

Those with good eyesight are jumping spiders, portia, and a few ground spiders. These species are easily distinguished by having two large front-facing eyes.Due to bad eyesight, most spiders use touch through their webs and/or hairs. The hirsute species can easily identify pretty much anything that causes a wind current near them, and most all species can easily identify prey by the distinct vibrations they make once caught in the web.If you watch most spiders, however, they can occasionally be fooled on windy day when a leaf or other detritus hits their webs, and they have to go touch it to find out it isn't prey.

I'm in my 40s, and my routine includes weight training, a high-protein diet, and Brazilian jiujitsu.My approach is minimum effective dose as an amplifier to a good diet and active lifestyle, and it's been pretty damn effective. Primary effects are an effortless relationship with food -  the \"itch\" I used to feel to eat constantly is pretty much gone, and the psychological pain of not eating things is more or less nonexistent. I did a 36 hour fast just to push it a bit, and it was trivially easy.Side effects include an elevated heart rate (~5-8bpm, in my case taking me into the low 60s at rest) and sweating all the time, both of which are almost certainly due to the glucagon agonist's thermogenesis effect.

          "content": "What a clueless post. Even ignoring their massive overstatement of the difficulty and hardware complexity of hardware mapping tables, they appear to not even understand the problems solved by mapping tables.Okay, let us say you have a physical object store. How are the actual contents of those objects stored? Are they stored in individual, isolated memory blocks? What if I want to make a 4 GB array? Do I need to have 4 GB memory blocks? What if I only have 6 GB? That is obviously unworkable.Okay, we can solve that by compacting our physical object store onto a physical linear store and just presenting a object store as a abstraction. Sure, we have a physical linear store, but we never present that to the user. But what if somebody deallocates a object? Obviously we should be able to reuse that underlying physical linear store. What if they allocated a 4 GB array? Obviously we need to be able to fragment that into smaller pieces for future objects. What if we deallocated 4 GB of disjoint 4 KB objects? Should we fail to allocate a 8 KB object just because the fragments are not contiguous? Oh, just keep in mind the precise structure of the underlying physical store to avoid that (what a leaky and error-prone abstraction). Oh, but what about if there are multiple programs running, some potentially even buggy, how the hell am I supposed to keep track of the shared physical store to keep track of global fragmentation of the shared resource?Okay, we can solve all of that with a level of indirection by giving you a physical object key instead of a physical object \"reference\". You present the key, and then we have a runtime structure that allows us to lookup where in the physical linear store we have put that data. This allows us to move and compact the underlying storage while letting you have a stable key. Now we have a mapping between object key and linear physical memory. But what if there are multiple programs on the same machine, some of which may be untrustworthy? What if they just start using keys they were not given? Obviously we need some scheme of preventing anybody from using any key. Maybe we could solve that by tagging every object in the system with a list of every program allowed to use it? But the number of programs is dynamic and if we have millions or billions of objects, each new program would require re-tagging all of those objects. We could make that list only encode \"allowed\" programs which would save space and amount of cleanup work, but how would the hardware do that lookup efficiently and how would it store that data efficiently?Okay, we can solve that by having a per-program mapping between object key to linear physical memory. Oh no, that is looking suspiciously close to the per-program mapping between linear virtual memory to linear physical memory. Hopefully there are no other problems that will just result in us getting back to right where we started. Oh no, here comes another one. How is your machine storing this mapping between object key to linear physical memory? If you will remember from your data structures courses, those would usually be implemented as either a hash table or a tree. A tree sounds too suspiciously close to what currently exists, so let us use a hash table.Okay, cool, how big should the hash table be? What if I want a billion objects in this program and a thousand objects in a different program? I guess we should use a growable hash table. All that happens is that if we allocate enough objects we allocate a new, dynamically sized storage structure then bulk rehash and insert all the old objects. That is amortized O(1), just at the cost of a unpredictable pause on potentially any memory allocation which can not only be gigantic, but is proportional to the number of live allocations. That is fine if our goal is just putting in a whole hardware garbage collector, but not really applicable for high performance computing. For high performance computing we would want worse case bounded time and memory cost (not amortized, per-operation).Okay, I guess we have to go with a per-program tree-based mapping between object key to linear physical memory. But it is still a object store, so we won, right? How is the hardware going to walk that efficiently? For the hardware to walk that efficiently, you are going to want a highly regular structure with high fanout to both maximize the value of the cache lines you will load and to reduce the worst case number of cache lines you need to load. So you will want a B-Tree structure of some form. Oh no, that is exactly what hardware mapping tables look like.But it is still a object store, so we won, right? But what if I deallocated 4 GB of disjoint 4 KB objects? You could move and recompact all of that memory, but why? You already have a mapping structure with a layer of indirection via object keys. Just create a interior mapping within a object between the object-relative offsets and potentially disjoint linear physical memory. Then you do not need physically contiguous backing, you can use disjoint physical linear store to provide the abstraction of a object linear store.And now we have a per-program tree-based mapping between linear object address to linear physical memory. But what if the objects are of various sizes? In some cases the hardware will traverse the mapping from object key to linear object store, then potentially need to traverse another mapping from a large linear object address to linear physical memory. If we just compact the linear object store mappings, then we can unify the trees and just provide a common linear address to linear physical memory mapping and the tree-based mapping will be tightly bounded for all walks.And there we have it, a per-program tree-based mapping between linear virtual memory and linear physical memory one step at a time.",

These systems were initially aimed at businesses (for example, Ford was a big customer for such things as managing what parts were flowing where) I believe, but later they managed to support FORTRAN with its unsafe flat model.These were large machines (think of a room 20m square) and with explicit hardware support for Algol operations including the array stuff and display registers for nested functions, were complex and power hungry and with a lot to go wrong.

These objects have to live somewhere, unless the author is proposing a system without the classical model of addressable RAM.—-1: the reason I prefer a linear address space is that I want to run millions of actors/capabilities on a machine, and the latency and memory usage of switching address space and registers become really onerous. Also, I am really curious to see how ridiculously fast modern CPUs are when you’re not thrashing the TLB every millisecond or so.2: in my case I let system processes/capabilities written in C run in linear address space where security isn’t a concern, and user space in a RISC-V VM so they can’t escape. The dream is that CHERI actually goes into production and user space can run on hardware, but that’s a big if.The memory management story is still a big question: how do you do allocations in a linear address space?

To them I can only say:  Study harder, this is so much more technologically interesting, than you can imagine.And yes, neither the iAPX432, nor for that matter Z8000, fared well with their segmented memory models, but it is important to remember that they primarily failed for entirely different reasons, mostly out of touch top-management, so we cannot, and should not, conclude from that, that all such memory models cannot possibly work.There are several interesting memory models, which never really got a fair chance, because they came too early to benefit from VLSI technology, and it would be stupid to ignore a good idea, just because it was untimely. (Obligatory \"Mother of all demos\" reference goes here.)CHERI is one such memory model, and probably the one we will end up with, at least in critical applications:  Stick with the linear physical memory, but cabin the pointers.In many applications, that can allow you to disable all the Virtual Memory hardware entirely.  (I think the \"CHERIot\" project does this ?)The R1000 model is different, but as far as I can tell equally valid, but it suffers from a much harder \"getting from A to B\" problem than CHERI does, yet I can see several kinds of applications where it\nwould totally scream around any other memory model.But if people have never even heard about it, or think that just because computers look a certain way today, every other idea we tried must be definition have been worse, nobody will ever do the back-of-the-napkin math, to see if would make sense to try it out (again).I'm sure there are also other memory concepts, even I have not heard about.  (Yes, I've worked with IBM S/38)But what we have right now, huge flat memory spaces, physical and virtual, with a horribly expensive translation mechanism between them, and no pointer safety, is literally the worst of all imaginable memory models, for the kind of computing we do, and the kind of security challenges we face.There are other similar \"we have always done it that way\" mental blocks we need to reexamine, and I will answer one tiny question below, by giving an example:Imagine you sit somewhere in a corner of a HUGE project, like a major commercial operating system with al the bells and whistles, the integrated air-traffic control system for a continent or the software for a state-of-the-art military gadget.You maintain this library, which exports this function, which has a parameter which defaults to three.For sound and sane reasons, you need to change the default to four now.The compiler wont notice.The linker wont notice.People will need to know.Who do you call ?In the \"Rational Environment\" on the R1000 computer, you change 3 to 4 and, when you attempt to save your change, the semantic IDE refuses, informing you that it would change the semantics of the following three modules, which call your function without specifying that parameter explicitly - even if you do not have read permission to the source code of those modules.The Rational Environment did that 40 years ago, can your IDE do that for you today ?Some developers get a bit upset about that when we demo that in Datamuseum.dk :-)The difference is that all modern IDEs regard each individual source file as \"ground truth\", but has nothing even remotely like an overview, or conceptual understanding, of the entire software project.Yeah, sure, it knows what include files/declaration/exports things depend on, and which source files to link into which modules/packages/libraries, but it does not know what any of it actually means.And sure, grep(1) is wonderful, but it only tells you what source code you need to read - provided you have the permission to do so.In the Rational Environment ground truth is the parse tree, and what can best be described as a \"preliminary symbol resolution\", which is why it knows exactly which lines of code, in the entire project, call your function, with or without what parameters.Not all ideas are good.Not all good ideas are lucky.Not all forgotten ideas should be ignored.",

Because such pointers are inherently abstract, the fact that the underlying physical memory address space is linear is irrelevant and the memory model looks more like \"every object is a segment\" if you squint hard.

It lacked very simple look ahead mechanisms, no instruction or data caches, no registers and not even immediates. Performance did not seemed to be a top priority in the design, to paraphrase an architect. Additionally, the compiler team was not aligned and failed to deliver on time, which only compounded the performance problem.  - [1] https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/45059.214411",

Within a page everything is linear as usual.The reason why linear address spaces are everywhere has to do with the fact that they are extremely cost effective and fast to implement in hardware. You can do prefix matching to check if an address is pointing at a specific hardware device and you can use multiplexers to address memory. Addresses can easily be encoded inside a single std_ulogic_vector. It's also possible to implement a Network-on-Chip architecture for your on-chip interconnect. It also makes caching easier, since you can translate the address into a cache entry.When you add a scan chain to your flip flops, you're implicitly ordering your flip flops and thereby building an implicit linear address space.There is also the fact that databases with auto incrementing integers as their primary keys use a logical linear address space, so the most obvious way to obtain a non-linear address space would require you to use randomly generated IDs instead.

While the OS does give you the ability to switch off notifications based on channels, most apps either don't use it or abuse it intentionally. In my case, I live in a gated society that uses an app called MyGate to allow visitors, and the app intentionally pushes ads through the same channels since you cannot block them.What - DoNotNotify is an app that logs all incoming notifications, and displays them grouped by app. It also captures the action behind the notification, which can be triggered from the app itself. From this log, you can create rules to whitelist/blacklist notifications from apps depending on their notification content. These filters can even be regex expressions, which allows for more complicated use-cases. The app ships with some pre-defined rules for popular apps like Facebook, Amazon, Instagram, Netflix, TikTok, Reddit etc.Where - The website is at https://donotnotify.com/.Would also like to call out that the app runs purely on your device, never communicates with anything on the Internet, and only requires notifications access to work. It is completely free, and there is no advertising or hidden gotchas.",

      "content_cn": "为什么——我受够了安卓手机上应用滥用通知功能。虽然操作系统确实允许你根据渠道关闭通知，但大多数应用要么不使用这一功能，要么故意滥用。以我为例，我住在一个封闭式小区，使用一款名为MyGate的应用来管理访客，而该应用故意通过同一渠道推送广告，因为你无法屏蔽它们。\n\n是什么——DoNotNotify是一款记录所有传入通知并按应用分组显示的应用程序。它还能捕获通知背后的操作，这些操作可以从应用本身触发。从这个日志中，你可以根据通知内容创建规则，将应用的通知加入白名单或黑名单。这些过滤器甚至可以是正则表达式，从而支持更复杂的用例。该应用预装了一些针对流行应用（如Facebook、Amazon、Instagram、Netflix、TikTok、Reddit等）的预定义规则。\n\n在哪里——网站地址是https://donotnotify.com/。还想特别指出...",
      "abstract": "该讨论围绕一款名为DoNotNotify的Android应用展开，该应用旨在记录并智能屏蔽手机通知。核心话题是用户对应用滥用通知功能的普遍不满，以及如何有效管理通知。\n\n社区中主要观点呈现分歧。有人认为该工具很有用，但担忧其闭源可能带来的隐私风险，强调必须开源才愿意使用或付费支持。也有用户指出该应用未申请网络权限，因此无法外传数据，相对安全。讨论中提到，部分用户倾向于直接卸载滥发通知的应用，或依赖系统自带的通知管理功能，但批评Android现有的通知控制仍不够完善，尤其是对老年人群体造成的骚扰更为严重。此外，有用户推荐了功能更成熟的同类应用BuzzKill作为替代方案。\n\n共识在于，多数用户认同应用滥用通知推送广告是普遍问题，且当前操作系统提供的通知管理方式复杂、效果有限。分歧主要体现在解决方案上：一部分用户坚持开源与隐私安全为先，另一部分则更关注实际功能与便捷性。同时，有观点指出类似问题在iOS平台同样存在。",

          "content": "In my view, the meta-advice is to understand the goals and constraints of your boss (and their boss), and work towards those goals (while adhering to the constraints).With that perspective, we can derive some rules of thumb:1. Promotions are not a reward for past performance. Instead, they are a bet that you will contribute more towards those goals with a promotion than without one.2. As the OP says, if you are demonstrating performance at your boss's level, that's evidence/proof that a promotion is warranted. Your boss's goals get implemented (by you), freeing them to work on their boss's goals (and maybe get their own promotion).3. The more time you spend with your boss, the better you will understand their goals, and symmetrically, the better they will understand your strengths. That means leaving a job after a year or two is not always optimal. It also means following a good boss to another company is often a good move.4. There will be cases where the goals of your boss (and their boss) diverge from your own goals. They often want to cut costs, but you want a salary increase. There are never easy answers to this dilemma, but seeing their perspective is useful so you can find a win-win scenario. E.g., if you come up with a way to save money in other ways, such as automating an external cost, then your increased salary will be worth it.5. In some cases, of course, there is no way to reconcile your boss's goals with your own. Realizing that is useful so you can find a different company/boss that is more aligned.",

However, if you want to avoid friction when asked, “Why should I promote you to this role?”, you should already be doing the job and proving you can do it.I once saw a QA tester tinkering with the front-end code, fixing the bugs himself, then went to the engineer and pointed out where to fix. When asked if he wanted to become a front-end engineer, I realized he was waiting for an opportunity to be promoted. So, I repeated my usual advice: if you want to be promoted, be already doing that role. He started learning, and work on front-end work besides his QA work. When he asked to be promoted, it was just a title change and a pay raise. He went on to lead the Product Design Team at a major oil company (at a branch in Bangalore, India). A Good photographer, and always has an eye for design.Similar story of an engineer waiting to be promoted to a Lead Architect. Advised him to start doing it way before talking about his promotion.

I care more that you are willing to take responsibility at a higher level than your absolute performance at what you do.

Fixing mistakes often involves demonstrating many aspects of operating at a higher level as well - you take the lead on communicating with other teams about the mistake, addressing the impact, apologising for any harm caused.For me, taking responsibility is one of those necessary (but not sufficient) things I have to see before I will consider a promotion (at least, a genuine one where someone actually operates at a higher level with more autonomy).",

Someone who acts senior before they're senior. This kind of work makes the team better -- there's plenty of it to go around. But people aren't always rewarded for doing it.If you take the op advice literally, you might find that you're not promoted AND management thinks you're bad at your jobSo the rules of promotions:1. First, do the things that are expected of you. If you don't do these things (or you do them in a way that management doesn't expect or can't measure) you will have to do additional work to make sure they get measured. Staff engineers are good at doing auxillary work and explaining why it's valuable. If you aren't, then focus on the things that are obviously valuable2. If you're doing everything your team needs from you, now is a great time to do the additional work. Figure out where test coverage is anemic, profile that really slow query, write up your list of pain points and throw together a list of some initial ideas for solutions (codex & Claude can be great helps here, but don't be like OP. If you use AI to write something, let everyone know: \"codex and I think these solutions might work, but I haven't spent much time on it\")3.

To get promoted at Google from L5 (Sr SWE) to L6 (Staff SWE) you need to do the work of a GOOD L6 for 1y+ and have made some very solid internal networking connections and have multiple managers on your side and have an opening for such a role.To get hired away from Google to an L6-equivalent role at Meta (or whereever) you need to get halfway through one L6 project and do a few hours of interviewing. There's no comparison in the level of effort. (And I'm not picking on Google here. I think it's the same or worse nearly everywhere.)",

And a lot of them still don't get the promotion. For years, or even ever. This is all free labor for the company. They get away paying for a team of 4 instead of a team of 5.That's what I'm pushing back on. In practice, it's rarely doing your existing work but better -- it's doing a bunch of extra work that takes more time. Because nobody ever says \"hey show that you can take on these new responsibilities, and so do less of your original responsibilities\".Contrast this to actually being promoted, where some of your previous responsibilities are now actually delegated to others, because your job is now focused more on higher-level design and/or management.",

Just as importantly, you also need to be aware of what type of an environment you are in and plan accordingly.Sometimes, you are just in an environment where it is somewhere between extremely improbable and nearly impossible to get promoted. At that point, you would be better served to put more effort into changing that environment, instead of chasing the grind. I learned that one the hard way a few years ago, at, ironically, Google.I was on track to a promo, got a documented track record, got the backing of multiple managers + my team lead, etc. But guess what? Another reorg happened shortly before the cutoff for the review cycle, i got a new manager who literally just met me for the first time, and my chances tanked to essentially zero (which is understandable, because I don’t see how a manager who just discovered my existence a week prior would be able to effectively back my promo package). Since then, I had an average of 3-5 major reorgs and 1-2 manager changes per year. As I came to eventually realize, this type of a dysfunctional environment wasn’t conductive to a good career velocity.Needless to say, my decision to just put my head in the sand and grind harder to compensate for this kind of organizational instability was stupid. It would’ve definitely been a better bet (in terms of time/effort, career trajectory, and compensation) to put even just a portion of that effort into changing my environment, as opposed to trying to compensate for organizational dysfunction with raw work effort.TLDR: if you care about having a good promotion velocity, focus on the biggest blocker in your specific situation. Whether it is the lack of track record demonstrating sustained effort at the L+1 level, or your environment being dysfunctional in ways that make promotions improbable, etc. Just gotta keep the eyes on the prize, and pick the solutions that are the most appropriate for your individual situation (instead of blindly just doing \"XYZ because I read that it was a great career advice\" in a single-minded manner).",

All of those differences are luxuries, and many of them are informal and thus hard to tax.  If we were to successfully tax all the formal luxuries (which in and of itself becomes legislative whack-a-mole), the wealthy will have a strong incentive to shift much of their luxury consumption to informal luxuries.Plus, I find all of the focusing on \"wealth tax\" and \"luxury tax\" and such rather mystifying when we have an extremely regressive income tax in the US.  The low tax rate for long-term unearned income in the US, combined with the fact that borrowing against assets does not realize any of the gains, makes effective tax rates for the 99.9 percentile much lower than the 90th percentile.It is possible to eliminate dynastic wealth just by ensuring the losses due to inflation and taxes exceeds investment returns at the top tax bracket.1: Or the difference in your kid applying to a college with your name on one of the buildings versus someone else's kid applying to that school",

As a result, it's largely the people who control that capital who benefit from it, not the individual workers whose productivity is increased by it.There were people who added value to a manufacturing process by being highly skilled welders (earning $30/hr) who can push MIG wire at 30 inches per minute. On a good day, they actually average 20 inches per minute OEE because they also need to load and unload the fixture, take lunch breaks, and so on. Those welders become (or are replaced by) weld-jig-operators, who can load a buffer of incoming parts, unload a buffer of completed parts, and replace emptied spools of wire, clean up the work area, and so on, while the $400k weld cell with a trio of ArcMate robots pushes 80 inches of wire per minute.Yes, that's a 4x productivity gain, but does the welder now earn $120 hour? No, the new operator now gets a pay cut back to $20/hr because you can train a replacement in a week (unlike a welder, who needs years of practice to manipulate a torch that skillfully). Meanwhile, the owner of the company profits at ~$100/hr, recoups their big capital investment after a year, and rakes in the profits after that to buy another yacht, or maybe a newspaper.",

So now he has been interrupted twice by two different manager and you have contradicted your own boss in front of an employee. You just broke a cardinal rule of middle management: it's ok to tell your boss he is wrong, but not in front of someone else.\nAdditionally, you also need to tell him to f** off with is request to get the numbers (without even trying to understand if the request was legitimate or not !), so that your precious sprint is saved. I don't see how he gets what he wants in your ideal handling. AT best you seem to tell him you will \"look into it\" in two weeks.Much better solution is to help you junior dev solve the problem so the interruption goes away as fast as possible and he can go back to contributing to the sprint. If the VP requires these numbers and went as far as back channeling you there is probably a quite good reason for that. Maybe the last time he needed something you told him it was not possible because the sprint thingy is unmovable ?\nOnce you have the result, you can go give those to the VP yourself, highlight the work of the junior dev, and use this \"I am giving you the very important data you asked for\" as a foot in the door to show that you had to pull the dev from the other feature, that these interruption also have cost and that you are more than happy to take care of them. He gets what he wants, the difficult conversation of \"you did not do what you are supposed to do\" happens behind closed doors, and you have a much better of getting results if he sees you as an ally to get his important stuff rather than a hinderance.",

If Gary has a meeting with the client later and it goes poorly, that could be in part because of the lack of flexibility of the team to meet Gary's needs. If Gary is a bad leader, he's going to be doing a lot of fly-bye requests. If he is a good leader, he'll do it when it is truly necessary.

At the end of a sprint, there should be plenty of things to demo even if search doesn't make it into this sprint.

Their popularity also increased as retro aesthetics has made a come back among Gen Z and younger millennials, who tend to value form AND function, and personal taste, over louder mass market status brands. Maybe NB marketing strategy was more of a response to an existing shift in consumer demand, but the value proposition was already there.",

It's turned dozens of them into billionaires in the last decade - more value creation than their acting or music careers:Skims (Kim Kardashian), Fenty (Rihanna), Rare Beauty (Selena Gomez), etc. etc.These companies have $500M ARR+ and aren't even a decade old.Celebrities are the ideal launching platform for new consumer brands. When your customer spends 30% of their day thinking about celebrities, you've already won them from a marketing perspective.My wife pays attention to the Kardashians, Hailey Bieber, Millie Bobby Brown, and the like. She knows instantly the moment there's some pop up for one of these brands. A large percentage of women her age do. It's practically the function of Instagram and TikTok to get the message out.This is huge. Brands anchored by influencers and celebrities capture public attention and consumers have an in-built desire to purchase and support those products.Celebs constantly show up on social feeds. It's not just free advertising. It's almost like a miasma where consumers live in the personality and the brand. People that follow celebs know about this stuff as much as you or I know about Nvidia or chip shortages. They're as loyal as Nintendo or Valve fans.Nike has no way to get exposure to this.  They have no equity left to give. They could make rev split deals like the Nike Jordan line, but that doesn't come with true ownership or control. The celeb doesn't sit on the board and control the company directly. And celebrities are all about image and control.I expect more and more celebs and athletes to launch their own brands. It's a free billion dollar opportunity for them. It's the best way for them to capitalize on their status and turn it into a durable platform for their likeness beyond their career's peak.",

But in more static or settled market environments it may be wiser (for investors) to focus elsewhere and restrict founder autonomy. We see this pretty commonly with successful founders who get \"phased out\" and replaced with more experienced managers.I wonder how much this sort of \"distributed decision-making\" has been formalized and studied.",

But today, early hires are the ones who seem to be getting screwed.In cases I've seen recently, even if the startup has a nice exit for founders and investors, employees would have been better off as a worker drone at a FAANG-like.Do we need PG to write an essay (or the richest managing partners to make a video), about the value of incentivizing early hires?Or, don't even talk about the value of it (since some aspiring founders are aggressively confident now, that they know how all the ducks are lined up), but talk about new criteria: YC looks for a respectable pool to incentivize early hires as positive signal, when determining who to fund.",

On the surface it might seem simpler to do a game, but once you get into the mechanics of building, testing and publishing something for the masses, the fear of cold calling or emailing total strangers begins to evaporate quickly.About 99% of the work you do on a game will wind up in the trashcan. Doesn't matter what kind of work it is. Code, audio, textures, models, map layouts, multiplayer balancing work, etc. are all susceptible in the same way. No one is safe from the chaos. It takes a lot of human energy and persistence to produce sufficient 1% content to fill up a player experience.I'd estimate for a B2B SaaS product, the ratio is approximately the same, however you don't need such a broad range of talent to proceed. One developer with a desire to do the hard things constantly can be all you need to make it to profitability. Going from one employee to N employees in a creative venture is where things go bananas. If you absolutely must do an indie game and you need it to succeed or your internet will get cut off, you will want to strongly consider doing it by yourself.

Multiple threads have exposed this pattern [1][2][3].*Paid fake posts:* High school students report being offered payment to write promotional Reddit posts [4].*Pressuring critics:* Users who post negative reviews report being contacted directly by company representatives, told it's \"a shame\" they're posting publicly [5]. Critical comments receive coordinated mass downvotes [6].*Soliciting copyrighted materials:* They use TikTok influencers and fake reddit posts to persuade students to sell them official IB exam papers, violating IB policies [7].The r/IBO moderators are actively investigating [8].These practices appear to be working great for them. Recently, they acquired OnePrep (oneprep.xyz), a free SAT prep tool that was already popular on r/sat. Since the acquisition, the same manipulation tactics have been deployed at scale: 150 Trustpilot reviews in a window of a few days [9], and widespread coordinated Reddit manipulation—multiple accounts posting \"tips\" that recommend Oneprep, coordinated upvoting, and fake enthusiasm in comments.

With amusement, I watched it bump off a table leg, and rotate perfectly into position to drive through the open front door, then slowly drive forwards out of the store, never to be seen again.Not long after that is when I started reading hardware hacking stuff. The early Roombas were extremely hackable - each one had a serial port connector under a cover and you could connect it to a computer and drive them around. It was the pre-Raspberry Pi days; I remember people attaching a router or the lightest netbook they could find for some sort of wifi remote control.I was too young to ever get to play with one, but I did get to take a broken one apart once. Some highlights were the planetary gearbox contained inside the wheel hubs, and a cam on the rear caster which would trigger an optical limit switch once per rotation so it could estimate distance traveled.",

          "content": "Lead mechanical engineer of the original Roomba here. The article is good on the behavior based algorithmic approach, but equal weight should be given to both the clever sensor design, and the extremely unusual 'passive feedback' cleaning head system the team came up with.The bump sensor, cliff detection, and wall detection were all implemented with plain IR LED emitter/receiver pairs, and very carefully shaped plastic enclosures so that the sensors provided a binary signal (floor vs. cliff, wall present/absent, etc.) that would hold up for the millions of cycles the machines racked up. This 'filtering in the sensor' simplified the inputs to the 8 bit 8051 microcontroller, and lowered the cost to a couple of cents for each detector.The cleaning head used the torque of the brush motor to actively control the height of the cleaning head as the machine moved from carpet to hard floors and back. That's the 'core trick' that let the Roomba clean well on multiple surfaces with about 15 watts of brush power. Details in the now-expired patent -- https://patents.google.com/patent/US6883201B2/en.Dave Nugent came up with the original torque lift idea, and then we worked it into the 'floating pulley' approach used in the final design. It seems obvious now, but at the time this was a radically different approach to mobile cleaning. Everyone else (Electrolux, Karcher, etc.) tried to make a miniature vacuum, but that burned too much power for a mobile system.Joe Jones (project originator and team physicist) wrote a book about the original team and our development process that I recommend: https://dancingwithroomba.com/Minor tech notes: Phil Mass did the original programming on the first generation Roomba in C on the aforementioned Winbond 8051 microcontroller. I think it had 256 bytes (!!!) of RAM and 4K of ROM.The code was burned into the chip at its creation (no onboard flash!) so it had to be right the first time. For the 2nd generation system they ported the behavior code to the internal LISP dialect in use at iRobot.It was a wild ride. I'm both proud of what we did, and dismayed (but not surprised) at what happened afterwards.",

These pseudo-standards did absolutely nothing to help our customers, and were pure bureaucracy and very very complicated to implement.I'd recently read Charles Ferguson's book about how his company was acquired by MSFT, and recognized this part of their standard operating procedure, along with extreme and invasive due diligence where they spend a lot of time working out if you're stupid/pliable enough to jump through these hoops while buying themselves time to work out if they can clone your product.  I tried to warn management (yes, really - even bought them copies of the book) but naturally no one would listen, and reading a book was too much like hard work.

During my searches for example, I came across this great compilation of visual SLAM projects: https://github.com/VSLAM-LAB/VSLAM-LABUnless you're a massive operation, you're probably just using an existing academic project, many of which handle a variety of inputs (depth, 2D lidar, 3D lidar etc), ie RTABMAP (what I started with), ORB-SLAM, nVidia Issac ROS SLAM (if you're on Jetson) etc. AMCL is an old-school algorithm for localization with 2D data - I tried it by taking a fake 2D scan from the depth camera and it was pretty terrible, so currently I'm trying to get visual-only SLAM working well enough for me because I don't want to spend $1k on a decent 3D lidar.",

AFAICT, tailscale itself provides several things that look like they're this, but aren't quite the right thing, for example https://tailscale.com/kb/1203/audit-logging is about logging changes to the tailnet itself (eg adding nodes), and https://tailscale.com/kb/1246/tailscale-ssh-session-recordin... is recording the ssh sessions rather than simple events for XYZ logged in / XYZ session idle / XYZ disconnected.(And yes, I know people have opinions about common admin accounts, but tailscale is another route into what FB described as far as everyone accessing the same root account but doing so with their own credentials [good!] rather than a shared key [very bad!]: https://engineering.fb.com/2016/09/12/security/scalable-and-...)",

I remember as a kid I had \"Sega Smash Pack\" on my PC, which used Kega Fusion, and on Steam I have \"Sega Mega Drive & Genesis Classics\", which is using vanilla Genesis ROMs that I believe you can load in virtually any emulator.Compare this to Nintendo, who took down stuff like AM2R, and multiple Switch emulators.",

          "content": "I worked at a company that wanted to implement an AI chatbot. I was helping to review the potential issues. On the first try I realised it was given full access to all past orders, for all customers via an API it could query in the background. So I could cajole it to look up other people's orders. It took less than 3 minutes of checking to figure this out.Often engineers and especially non-technical people don't have the immediate thought of \"let's see how I can exploit this\" or if they do, they don't have the expertise to exploit it enough to see the issue(s). This is why companies have processes where all serious external changes need to go through a set of checks, in particular, by the IT security department. Yes, it's tedious and annoying, but it saves you from public blunders.Such processes also make sure that the IT security department knows of the new feature, and can give guidance and help to the engineers about IT security issues related to the new feature. So if they get feedback about security issues from users they won't freak out and know who to contact for support. This way, things like accusing the reporter for \"blackmailing\" don't happen.In general, this fiasco seems to show that Eurostar haven't integrated their IT security department into their processes. If there was trust and understanding among the engineers about what the IT department does, they would have (1) likely not released the tool with such issues and (2) would have known how to react when they got feedback from security researchers.",

Steve's MO is laid out in the medium post - but basically, it's okay to lose things, rewrite whole subsystems, whatever, this is the future. It's really fun and interesting to watch the speed of development.I've made a few multi agent coding setups in the last year, and I think gas town has the team side about right: big boss (mayor), operations boss (deacon), relatively linear keeper of truth (witness), single point for merges (refiner), lots of coders with their code held lightly.I love the idea of formulas - a lot of what makes gas town work and informs how well it ultimately will work is the formulas. They're close conceptually to skills.I don't love the mad max branding, but meh, whatever, it's fun, and a perk of the brave new world where you can make stuff like for a few hundred bucks a month sent to anthropic - software can have personality again, yay.Conceptually I think there is a product team element to this still missing - deploy engineers, product managers, visual testing. Everything is sort of out there, janky in parts, but workable to glue together right now, and will only improve. That said, the mad max town analogy is going to get overstretched at some point; we already have pretty good names for all the parts that are needed, and as coordination improves, we're going to want to add more stuff into the coordination. So, I'd like to see a version of this with normal names and expanded.Upshot - worth a look - if beads is any indication, give it a month or two or four to settle down unless you like living on the bleeding bleeding edge.",

I mean programs who only operate at the level of artificial computer abstractions.The hard part is always dealing with \"the real world\": hardware that returns \"impossible\" results to your nicely abstract api functions, things that stop working in places they really shouldn't be able to, or even, and this is the really tricky bit, dealing with humans.Databases are a good example of this kind of thing. It's easy to start off a database writing all the clever (and fun) bits like btrees and hash maps and chained hashes that spill to disk to optimize certain types of tables and so on, but I'd wager that at least half of the code in a \"real\" database like sqlite or postgresql is devoted to dealing with strange hardware errors or leaky api abstractions across multiple platforms or the various ways a human can send nonsensical input into the system and really screw things up.I'd also bet that this type of code is a lot less fun to write and took much longer than the rest (which incidentally is why I always get annoyes when programming language demos show code with only a happy path, but that's another rant and this comment is already excessive).Anyways, this AI thing is definitely a gold rush and it's important to keep in mind that there was in fact a lot of gold that got dug up but, as everyone constantly repeats, the more consistent way to benefit is sell the shovels and this is very definitely an ad for a shovel.",

There are many features that overlap significantly, strange bugs, and the docs are also AI generated so have fun reading them. It's a program that isn't only vibe coded, it was vibe designed too.Gas Town is clearly the same thing multiplied by ten thousand. The number of overlapping and adhoc concepts in this design is overwhelming. Steve is ahead of his time but we aren't going to end up using this stuff. Instead a few of the core insights will get incorporated into other agents in a simpler but no less effective way.And anyway the big problem is accountability. The reason everyone makes a face when Steve preaches agent orchestration is that he must be in an unusual social situation. Gas Town sounds fun if you are accountable to nobody: not for code quality, design coherence or inferencing costs. The rest of us are accountable for at least the first two and even in corporate scenarios where there is a blank check for tokens, that can't last. So the bottleneck is going to be how fast humans can review code and agree to take responsibility for it. Meaning, if it's crap code with embarrassing bugs then that goes on your EOY perf review.

The focus is throughput: creation and correction at the speed of thought.I see -- so where exactly is my focus supposed to sit?As someone who sits comfortably in the \"Stage 8\" category that this article defines, my concern has never been throughput, it has always been about retaining a high-degree of quality while organizing work so that, when context switching occurs, it transitions me to near-orthogonal tasks which are easy to remember so I can give high-quality feedback before switching again.For instance, I know Project A -- these are the concerns of Project A. I know Project B -- these are the concerns of Project B. I have the insight to design these projects so they compose, so I don't have to keep track of a hundred parallel issues in a mono Project C.On each of those projects, run a single agent -- with review gates for 2-3 independent agents (fresh context, different models! Codex and Gemini). Use a loop, let the agents go back and forth.This works and actually gets shit done. I'm not convinced that 20 Claudes or massively parallel worktrees or whatever improves on quality, because, indeed, I always have to intervene at some point. The blocker for me is not throughput, it's me -- a human being -- my focus, and the random points of intervention which ... by definition ... occur stochastically (because agents).Finally:> Opus 4.5 can handle any reasonably sized task, so your job is to make tasks for it. That’s it.This is laughably not true, for anyone who has used Opus 4.5 for non-trivial tasks. Claude Code constantly gives up early, corrupts itself with self-bias, the list goes on and on. It's getting better, but it's not that good.",

          "content": "Everyone keeps being angry at me when I mention that the way things are going, future development will just be based on \"did something wrong while writing code? all good, throw everything out and rewrite, keep pulling the level of the slot machine and eventually it'll work\". It's a fair tactic, and it might work if we make the coding agents cheap enough.I'll add a personal anecdote - 2 years ago, I wrote a SwiftUI app by myself (bare you, I'm mostly an infrastructure/backend guy with some expertise in front end, where I get the general stuff, but never really made anything big out of it other than stuff on LAMPP back in 2000s) and it took me a few weeks to get it to do what I want to do, with bare minimum of features. As I was playtesting my app, I kept writing a wishlist of features for myself, and later when I put it on AppStore, people around the world would email me asking for some other features. But life, work and etc. would get into way, and I would have no time to actually do them, as some of the features would take me days/weeks.Fast forward to 2 weeks ago, at this point I'm very familiar with Claude Code, how to steer multiple agents at a time, quick review its outputs, stitch things together in my head, and ask for right things. I've completed almost all of the features, rewrote the app, and it's already been submitted to AppStore. The code isn't perfect, but it's also not that bad. Honestly, it's probably better from what I would've written myself. It's an app that can be memory intensive in some parts, and it's been doing well from my testings. On top of it, since I've been steering 2-3 agents actively myself, I have the entire codebase in my mind. I also have overwhelming amount of more notes what I would do better and etc.My point is, if you have enough expertise and experience, you'll be able to \"stitch things together\" cleaner than others with no expertise. This also means, user acquisition, marketing and data will be more valuable than the product itself, since it'll be easier to develop competing products. Finding users for your product will be the hard part. Which kinda sucks, if I'll be honest, but it is what it is.",

If you have a dynamic programming style orchestration pattern for agents, you want the thing that solves the small unit of work (a task) to have as low error as possible, or else I suspect the error compounds quickly with these stochastic systems.I'm trying this stuff for fairly advanced work (in a PhD), so I'm dogfooding ideas (like the ones presented in this article) in complex settings. I think there is still a lot of room to learn here.",

Given a fully formed older project and a clean set of feature requests, Claude can be a beast. On the other hand, steering it through a greenfield project feels more labor intensive than writing the code myself.I'm a full stack dev, and solo, so I write data schema, backends and frontends at the same time, usually flipping between them to test parts of new features. As far as AI use, I'm really just at the level of using a single Claude agent in an IDE - and only occasionally, because it writes a lot of nonsense. So maybe I'm missing out on the benefits of multiple agents. But where I currently see value in it is in writing (1) boilerplate and (b) sugar - where it has full access to a large and stable codebase. Where I think it fails is in writing overarching logical structures, especially early on in a project. It isn't good at writing elegant code with a clear view of how data, back and front should work together. When I've tried to start projects from scratch with Claude, it feels like I'm fighting against its micro-view of each piece of code, where it's unable to gain a macro-view of how to orchestrate the whole system.So like, maybe a bottomless wallet and a dozen agents would help with that, but there isn't so much room for errors or bugs in my work code as there is in my fun/play/casual game code.

The ironic part is that the restoration itself requires human intervention. I always find myself wondering what would happen if humans just disappeared overnight. How things are now would be the starting point of the \"new natural.\" Ecosystems probably wouldn't return to the way they were before Europeans arrived; they would proceed along some new pathway. Not least because of how much we've already changed the climate, and the species we've introduced. Then I think about a time 100,000 years after this hypothetical disappearance of humans and picture conservationists of whatever species, aliens maybe, concerned with protecting the indigenous species they found like wild cows, Himalayan blackberry and kudzu, that are now endangered by overdevelopment and global cooling.Anyway it would be really interesting to be able to chart the changes to this microcosm of a prairie ecosystem over thousands of years if there were no human intervention whatsoever.",
