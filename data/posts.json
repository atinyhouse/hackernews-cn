      "abstract": "该讨论围绕用户因不满微软系统而转向Linux的经历展开。核心话题是Windows 11在性能、隐私和用户体验上的缺陷如何促使部分用户迁移至Linux，同时探讨了Linux自身的优缺点。\n\n多数用户对Windows 11表示失望，认为其文件浏览器卡顿、强制在线账户、界面广告化等问题严重。有人指出公司安装的终端管理软件可能加剧了性能问题，也有用户强调长期使用Windows需花费大量时间调整设置以规避不便。讨论中普遍认同Linux在隐私控制和系统轻量性上的优势，尤其对避开AI集成等隐私担忧的用户具有吸引力。\n\n但社区对Linux的看法存在分歧。有人认为Linux对非专业用户不够友好，常需查阅论坛解决配置问题，且界面框架碎片化严重；也有用户指出，从苹果或Windows转向Linux虽需长期适应，但最终值得。部分用户幽默表示微软已转向Azure盈利，不再依赖Windows销售，间接促使了用户流失。整体上，讨论反映了操作系统选择中的权衡：Windows的便利性与侵入性并存，Linux的自由度则以学习成本为代价。",

          "content": "I switched from Windows (11) to Linux (Xubuntu) back in November, mostly because of all the AI stuff I didn't trust.  While Linux is working ok for me, I can see why people complain about its not being user-friendly, particularly if you're not a Real Programmer.  I've had to go to forums too many times to figure out why this or that doesn't work.  The latest is the fact that 'apt update' has stopped working today for Vivaldi--it worked ok yesterday, but I have not been able to get it working after spending an hour or more.  (If you're interested, there's a thread here: https://forum.vivaldi.net/topic/115133/public-key-is-not-ava....)Also the fact that some apps update via 'apt', some by 'snap', and if you don't watch out some might update by 'flatpack'.  While I think snap is updating automatically, it's hard to tell; some mornings I wake my PC up and only hours later do I discover that there's an update pop-up hidden behind other windows.Oh, and every day I get a 'system problem' popup that asks if I want to submit a report, but won't tell me what the alleged problem was.  I thought only Microsoft did that sort of thing?I'm also not happy about the malware protection.  Apparently the only anti-virus still available is ClamAV (and Kapersky, but for reasons I won't go into I don't trust that).  But the gui for ClamAV has not been supported for several years, and running it from the command line is not so straightforward, never mind keeping it updated.  (And don't tell me that Linux doesn't need antivirus protection.  That's just whistling past the graveyard, particularly if you sometimes log in on public WiFi networks.)I guess there are distros that are better about some of these things, but life is too short to try all of them, and hope that some bug (like the Vivaldi update thing) doesn't show up months later.So yes, I'm using Linux, and I'm not planning to go back to Windows.  But Linux sure could work better.",

I gave up with Windows 10 because you needed Windows Pro in order to make an \"offline\" account, I spent $2000+ for a gaming rig, and I couldn't add new users, one program told me to use the other program which brought me back to the original program... I had to go out of my way, buy a license just to make it work. I just went and installed Linux finally. I was on POP_OS! for a good year, but been on Arch Linux for one year plus now.I know its a \"meme\" to talk about how great Arch is, but when you want the latest of something, Arch has it. I use EndeavourOS since it had a nicer simpler installer (idk why Arch doesn't invest in whats standard in every other major distro) and if you just use \"yay\" you don't run into Pacman woes.Alternatively, I'm only buying Macs as well, but for my gaming rigs, straight to Arch.  Steam and Proton work perfectly, if you don't sell your games on Steam or in a way I can run them on Linux I am not buying or playing them.",

I acclimated to the boiling. And it's... okay. At least for now. But I know someday soon, the thousand faceless product managers at MSFT will break something unfixable. Somehow exceed the considerable abilities of the large community finding clever hacks and patches to keep the harsh Win wasteland livable for hardy souls.While I greatly appreciate Linux philosophically and deeply respect it architecturally, I still really liked what Windows got so close to being - right before MSFT shifted biz models, simultaneously de-investing and turning it into a promotional platform for their other business. When that day comes, it'll suck to leave behind the wonderful third-party tools like Everything search, Ditto clipboard and AHK automation that streamline my day.The thing I don't understand is why MSFT refuses to just make a version of Windows that's a Product again.

Linux still has it's fair share of bugs but I'll take having to deal with those over running Windows or MacOS any day.For me the biggest thing is control, with Windows there are some things like updates that you have zero control over. It's the same issue with MacOS, you have more control than Windows but you're still at the whims of Apple's design choices every year when they decide to release a new OS update.Linux, for all it's issues, give you absolute control over your system and as a developer I've found this one feature outweighs pretty much all the issues and negatives about the OS. Updates don't run unless I tell them to run, OS doesn't upgrade unless I  tell it to. Even when it comes to bugs at least you have the power to fix them instead of waiting on an update hoping it will resolve that issue. Granted in reality I wait for updates to fix various small issues but for bigger ones that impact my workflow I will go through the trouble of fixing it.I don't see regular users adopting Linux anytime soon but I'm quickly seeing adoption pickup among the more technical community. Previously only a subset of technical folks actually ran Linux because Windows/MacOS just worked but I see more and more of them jumping ship with how awful Windows and MacOS have become.",

Every other update was a blank/black screen and me without a good remote config to try to recover it.  After about 6 months it was actually stable, but I'd since gone ahead and paid too much for an RTX 3080, and gone back to my windows drive...I still used WSL almost all day, relying mostly on VS Code and a Browser open, terminal commands through WSL remoting in Code and results etc. on the browser.Then, one day, I clicked the trusty super/win menu and started typing in the name of he installed program I wanted to run... a freaking ad.  In the start menu search results.  I mean, it was a beta channel of windows, but the fact that anyone thought this was a good idea and it got implemented, I was out.I rebooted my personal desktop back to Linux... ran all the updates and it's run smoothly since.  My current RX 9070XT better still, couldn't be happier.  And it does everything I want it to do, and there's enough games in Steam through Proton that I can play what I want, when I want.  Even the last half year on Pop Coxmic pre-release versions was overall less painful than a lot of my Windows experiences the past few years.  Still not perfect, but at least it's fast and doesn't fail in ways that Windows now seems to regularly.Whoever is steering Windows development at Microsoft is clearly drunk at the wheel over something that should be the most \"done\" and polished product on the planet and it just keeps getting worse.",

One of the best things I did once I realized I was reluctantly on this journey, was start keeping notes in a cloud backed-up file of every registry setting I tweaked or little utility I installed. Just a quick cut and paste to remind me.Of course some of the notes become stale or irrelevant as things evolve but it's still invaluable insurance if this Windows install eventually gets crufty and needs to be hosed out for a fresh start (which eventually happens even with diligent hygiene). Also, don't forget ExplorerPatcher which restores some essential Win10 taskbar and explorer functionality MSFT removed from Win11 (promising to eventually replace with new code but now, years later, obviously never will). It's clear at this point MSFT isn't devoting any serious effort toward re-implementing previous functionality or creating new features for power users.AFAICT, the only things getting meaningful funding now are fixing critical 0days / bugs, reworking the interface to create \"more exposure vectors to support corporate initiatives\" and a couple under-resourced teams clearing only the most critical technical debt threatening the whole edifice. Meanwhile, every PM or UX designer who suggests \"Hey, it'd be easier to just decide that new feature or unrestored functionality will just confuse 'our average user'\" gets promoted. I just feel sorry for the engineers still there who joined the Windows team wanting to build toward a state-of-the-art operating system supporting a powerful, flexible, extensible, customizable user interface. Now it's \"If it ain't broken, there's no funding to fix it\" and \"If it just broke, see if we can just remove it instead of fixing it\", \"if it's there but incomplete, remove what's there, patch over the hole and we'll pretend it was never there.\" And finally, \"You seem ambitious and diligent, we just wish you'd align your interests with current strategic priorities (ie sticking AI where it doesn't belong or pushing Office, cloud, etc subs).\"",

But, if the OS has so many vulnerabilities that you're required to have endpoint management, that's not a good look on the OS.My current and former $JOB both required endpoint management on Macs (and a limited amount for folks who used Linux), so it's not a blanket statement. But the impact of the endpoint software on Mac and Linux were still much lower.

There was a time when there was a patent pool on the AC-3 codec (or something like that - I'm handwaving because I don't know all the details).  So Microsoft stopped licensing the patent, and now you just can't use AC-3 on Windows.  I spent an evening installing something called Virtual CABLE and trying to use it to juryrig my own Dolby Live encoder with ffmpeg… Never got it to work.It's easy to fall deep into the tinkerhole on Linux, which has kept me away for a long time, but as mainstream platforms get more locked down, or stop supporting things they decide should be obsolete, it's nice to have a refuge where you're still in control, and things still work.(Insert meme about the Windows API in Proton being a more stable target than actual Windows.)",

This is the most fine-grained. It's pretty easy to opt in on reasonably modern frameworks, too; just add in the necessary key in the resource manifest; done. [1]Linux + Xorg has a global pixel density scale factor. KDE/Qt handles this OK; GNOME/GTK break when the scaling factor is not an integer multiple of 96 and cause raster scaling.Linux + Wayland has per-display scaling factors, but Chromium, GNOME, and GTK break the same way as the Xorg setup. KDE/Qt are a bit better, but I'm quite certain the taskbar icons are sharper on Xorg than they are on Wayland. I think this boils down to subpixel rendering not being enabled.And of course, every application on Linux in theory can handle high pixel density, but there is a zoo of environment variables and command-line arguments that need to be passed for the ideal result.On macOS, if the pixel density of the target display is at least some Apple-blessed number that they consider 'Retina', then the 'Retina' resolutions are enabled. At resolutions that are not integer multiples of the physical resolution, the framebuffer is four times the resolution of the displayed values (twice in each dimension), and then the final result is raster-scaled with some sinc/Lanczos algorithm back down to the physical resolution. This shows up as ringing artifacts, which are very obvious with high-contrast, thin regions like text.On non-retina resolutions, there is zero concept of 'scaling factor' whatsoever; you can choose another resolution, but it will be raster-scaled (usually up) with some bi/trilinear filtering, and the entire screen is blurry. The last time Windows had such brute-force rendering was in Windows XP, 25 years ago.[1]: https://learn.microsoft.com/en-gb/windows/win32/hidpi/settin...",

If NSA has a Signal vulnerability they will probably use it very sparingly and on high profile foreign targets.- The fact that even casual third parties can break into these groups because of opsec issues shows that encryption is not a panacea. People will always make mistakes, so the fact that secure platforms exist is not a threat in itself, and legal backdoors are not needed.",

They'll also stand in front of the street exits to prevents their vehicles from leaving parking lots and so on.

You are maybe dimly aware of some social problems, but they're all somebody else's problems.If you're one of the many many thousands of people who have been abducted by federalized lunatics, or you have a child or family member in one of our concentration camps, things seem urgently and unimaginably bad.If you're politically involved, things seem tenuous, at best. You likely know someone who either feels justifiably terrified by what's going on, or someone whose life has been seriously impacted by it.I've spent several months successfully combating one of YC's contributions to all this mess. Tonight, federal law enforcement fired pepper rounds, flashbangs, and tear gas into a crowd of protestors who were noisy -- not violent, not even causing property damage, just noisy. One of the officers aimed the tear gas weapon directly at a protestor's head and caused a serious head injury (the kind that causes convulsions and foaming at the mouth after impact). And, they'll get away with that.The local police department was flying half a dozen drones directly over this, but they are only there to surveil and look for an excuse to put on riot gear.There were an assortment of reporters there, but most of them have editors or owners that won't run much of a story about any of it. A few politicians showed up, but they made a short speech and then left immediately. The building where this all happened is in a city center, so, just a block away, life and traffic continues as normal and most people are entirely unaware.So that's also why nobody's really been making an organized 2A effort either. For most people, this isn't \"real\", in the sense that it isn't something they're experiencing, and for those that are experiencing it, they're trying to walk a tightrope that resists the current administration without spiraling into a widespread civil war.",

It's reasonable to assume that about half of those people are just keeping to themselves or part of the political middle that feel something is a \"bit wrong\"; but not quite enough to go yell into the internet about it.

Watching the situation induces feelings of dread, despair or helplessness.On the opposing side, that 29% of people are faced with the fact that they might actually be the \"baddies\" (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ToKcmnrE5oY), and a good number of them are flooding conversations to prove they are in fact \"not\"... because admitting otherwise would mean they are actually doing something quite morally or ethically wrong by their own or their community standards.

It was thought that having a standing army would lead to bad incentives and militarism. Just like the Executive branch only has enumerated powers, with all main governing functions belonging to Congress. The founders were worried about vesting too much power in one man, so made the President pretty weak.

If your threat model includes traffic analysis, likely none of it would make much difference as far as US state-side sigint product line is concerned, but with Threema a determined party might as well get a chance! Arguably, the US protest organisers must be prepared for the situation to escalate, and adjust their security model accordingly: GrapheneOS, Mullvad subscription with DAITA countermeasures, Threema for Android, pay for everything with Monero?[1] https://threema.com/[2] https://shop.threema.ch/en",

      "abstract": "该讨论围绕TikTok用户无法上传批评美国移民及海关执法局（ICE）视频的现象展开。公司声称是技术故障，但社区普遍质疑其真实性。有用户结合个人经历指出，平台疑似对涉及政治抗议、移民议题的内容进行隐形审查，例如视频出现异常卡顿、音频被添加干扰噪音，或内容被无故限流。同时，新服务条款中追踪用户移民状态、政治倾向等条款引发对隐私侵犯的担忧。部分用户将此现象与历史上的媒体管控相类比，认为美国科技平台正走向言论管控；也有观点指出，这反映非美国企业面临的地缘政治压力，成功产品可能因外部干预而受限。讨论中形成的基本共识是：TikTok的“技术问题”解释缺乏说服力，其内容管控机制存在不透明性与政治倾向性。",

It was fixed (for his videos) after contacting somebody on the technical side of Youtube, but there was never an explanation AFAIK of what actually went wrong, so I was left pondering if that could be a result of some more ambitious ML-experiments in attempt to improve compression rates or something, but never found out conclusively.",

They are gonna work extra overtime to cool it down some for now, collect & put some frogs back in the pot.

Elli-Tok has nearly no chance of suceeding in building their own algorithm, from square 1, since they don't have access to the ByteDance algorithms. I don't know what access they have to international content and internstional viewing habits, don't know if US content flows to TikTok actual and if they get any algorithmic help from that. This feels like a suicidal business, buying a brand name but lacking any and all of the means to maintain product quality.There probably are real technical problems here. And feed preferences are probably just gone, while Elli-Tok rebuilds its own perhaps isolated perhaps loosely connected fork, while as said above probably lacking the content and viewer data to work from.But just as Ellison's bought CBS then let it be overrun & destroyed by the hollow Free Press propogandists (pretending to be neutral, I say as my eyes roll out of my head), I also tend to think they thought they could get away with doing what they want. Maybe they will get away with this project. Maybe it is all isolated US only content, maybe it is swamped with right wing agitprop from here on out. Maybe half those viewers here keep scrolling forever and that's good enough to make the incredibly fantastically rich happy with their US government facilitated acquisition, that sundering an interesting diverse well tuned network is maybe or maybe not a delight but a necessary thing to claw under for this desired class propoganda. But I tend to think they're alas probably smart enough to learn quickly this is not how you boil a frog, and tend to think Elli-Tok is going to (suck for a long while either way, but work to) dial down the right wingism & divisionism a lot, then slowly work it back up.(But man, watching these buffons mishandle CBS, watching ridiculous  bald faced \"salute to Mark Rubio\" sure makes it hard to  believe they have any competence at all.)Different topic but the extremely critical TikTok v.

That seems unlikely to work and the best talent in areas like AI seems to be fleeing voluntarily.Everything I hear from the inside says moral is in the toilet and the once proud “culture of innovation” is in shambles with teams focused on politics, infighting, and endless reorgs.Frankly, sounds like a s*itshow and what Jeff Bezos predicted as “Day 2” for the company’s eventual slow decline.",

They then make cuts before the evidence is in. What this means is that today, there are many LLM service deployments that replaced humans while their actual impact remains a mystery. Though it won't be a mystery to leadership forever.One example client that shouldn't dox me: Odom Corporation, a beverage distributor. They purchased an LLM-driven purchasing solution and immediately laid off their entire purchasing team, save for a few members who exist on the periphery. A follow-up with them showed that the system was ordering summer beverages coming into the winter (among many other bad purchasing decisions) and causing a dramatic increase in unsold inventory. Since they believe that LLMs will exponentially improve, they're dismissing it as a one-off because this year's models \"will be so much better\".

I ordered from a website the other day where it said Dec 22nd delivery, it came mid-January and support was unhelpful (parroting the FAQ, might have been a LLM).Now, I've head great experiences purchasing directly as well. The Smartest House [0] is where I buy everything I can smart-home-related. Their pricing is excellent, their shipping is fast, and their support is top-notch. I had a problem with 1 device, they got on a call and tried to fix it, then when that didn't work, they shipped me a replacement.So I agree, there are great alternative out there and I also like B&H. I just wish it was easier to be (more) sure about how quick something will ship or how easy returns will actually be.

And not just atrophy, but even moreso I think it's evolving into \"complacency\".Like there have been multiple times now where I wanted the code to look a certain way, but it kept pulling back to the way it wanted to do things. Like if I had stated certain design goals recently it would adhere to them, but after a few iterations it would forget again and go back to its original approach, or mix the two, or whatever. Eventually it was easier just to quit fighting it and let it do things the way it wanted.What I've seen is that after the initial dopamine rush of being able to do things that would have taken much longer manually, a few iterations of this kind of interaction has slowly led to a disillusionment of the whole project, as AI keeps pushing it in a direction I didn't want.I think this is especially true if you're trying to experiment with new approaches to things. LLMs are, by definition, biased by what was in their training data. You can shock them out of it momentarily, whish is awesome for a few rounds, but over time the gravitational pull of what's already in their latent space becomes inescapable. (I picture it as working like a giant Sierpinski triangle).I want to say the end result is very akin to doom scrolling. Doom tabbing?

I specifically chose Bevy as the latest version was after Claude's cut off, it had a number of breaking changes, and there aren't a lot of deep examples online.Overall it's going well, but one downside is that I don't really understand the code \"in my bones\". If you told me tomorrow that I had optimize latency or if there was a 1 in 100 edge case, not only would I not know where to look, I don't think I could tell you how the game engine works.In the past, I could not have ever gotten this far without really understanding my tools. Today, I have a semi functional game and, truth be told, I don't even know what an ECS is and what advantages it provides. I really consider this a huge problem: if I had to maintain this in production, if there was a SEV0 bug, am I confident enough I could fix it? Or am I confident the model could figure it out?

Yes, producing the outcome is important, but the journey taken to get there is a lot of fun for me.I used Claude Code to implement a OpenAI 4o-vision powered receipt scanning feature in an expense tracking tool I wrote by hand four years ago. It did it in two or three shots while taking my codebase into account.It was very neat, and it works great [^0], but I can't latch onto the idea of writing code this way. Powering through bugs while implementing a new library or learning how to optimize my test suite in a new language is thrilling.Unfortunately (for me), it's not hard at all to see how the \"builders\" that see code as a means to an end would LOVE this, and businesses want builders, not crafters.In effect, knowing the fundamentals is getting devalued at a rate I've never seen before.[^0] Before I used Claude to implement this feature, my workflow for processing receipts looked like this: Tap iOS Shortcut, enter the amount, snap a pic of the receipt, type up the merchant, amount and description for the expense, then have the shortcut POST that to my expenses tracking toolkit which, then, POSTs that into a Google Sheet. This feature amounted the need for me to enter the merchant and amount. Unfortunately, it often took more time to confirm that the merchant, amount and date details OpenAI provided were correct (and correct it when details were wrong, which was most of the the time) than it did to type out those details manually, so I just went back to my manual workflow. However, the temptation to just glance at the details and tap \"This looks correct\" was extremely high, even if the info it generated was completely wrong!

          "content": "It's unclear if you've presented this quote in order to support or criticize the idea that new technologies make us dumber.  (Perhaps that's intentional; if so, bravo).To me, this feels like support.  I was never an adult who could not read or write, so I can't check my experience against Socrates' specific concern.  But speaking to the idea of memory, I now \"outsource\" a lot of my memory to my smartphone.In the past, I would just remember my shopping list, and go to the grocery store and get what I needed.  Sure, sometimes I'd forget a thing or two, but it was almost always something unimportant, and rarely was a problem.  Now I have my list on my phone, but on many occasions where I don't make a shopping list on my phone, when I get to the grocery store I have a lot of trouble remembering what to get, and sometimes finish shopping, check out, and leave the store, only to suddenly remember something important, and have to go back in.I don't remember phone numbers anymore.  In college (~2000) I had the campus numbers (we didn't have cell phones yet) of at least two dozen friends memorized.  Today I know my phone number, my wife's, and my sister's, and that's it.  (But I still remember the phone number for the first house I lived in, and we moved out of that house when I was five years old.  Interestingly, I don't remember the area code, but I suppose that makes sense, as area codes weren't required for local dialing in the US back in the 80s.)Now, some of this I will probably ascribe to age: I expect our memory gets more fallible as we get older (I'm in my mid 40s).  I used to have all my credit/debit card numbers, and their expiration dates and security codes, memorized (five or six of them), but nowadays I can only manage to remember two of them.  (And I usually forget or mix up the expiration dates; fortunately many payment forms don't seem to check, or are lax about it.)  But maybe that is due to new technology to some extent: most/all sites where I spend money frequently remember my card for me (and at most only require me to enter the security code).  And many also take Paypal or Google Pay, which saves me from having to recall the numbers.So I think new technology making us \"dumber\" is a very real thing.  I'm not sure if it's a good thing or a bad thing.  You could say that, in all of my examples, technology serving the place of memory has freed up mental cycles to remember more important things, so it's a net positive.  But I'm not so sure.",

If I have a lot of complex workflows that need testing, I'll have it write unit tests and spell out the specific edge cases I'm worried about, or setup cheat codes I can invoke to test those workflows out in the UI/CLI.Trust comes from using them often - you get a feeling for what a model is good and bad at, and what LLMs in general are good and bad at. Most of them are a bit of a mess when it comes to UI design, for instance, but they can throw together a perfectly serviceable \"About This\" HTML page. Any long-form text they write (such as that About page) is probably trash, but that's super-easy to edit manually. You can often just edit down what they write: they're actually decent writers, just very verbose and unfocused.I find it similar to management: you have to learn how each employee works. Unless you're in the Top 1%, you can't rely on every employee giving 110% and always producing perfect PRs. Bugs happen, and even NASA-strictness doesn't bring that down to zero.And just like management, some models are going to be the wrong employee for you because they think your style guide is stupid and keep writing code how they think it should be written.",

If they log the attestations and the EK->AIK conversions, the database can be used to unmask you in the future.Also note that nothing can prevent you from forging attestations if you source a private-public key pair and a valid certificate, either by extracting them from a compromised device or with help from an insider at the factory.

See this blog post of Lennart's[0] and systemd's ParticleOS meta-distro[1].I do agree that these technologies can be abused. But system integrity is also a prerequisite for security; it's not like this is like Digital \"Rights\" Management, where it's unequivocally a bad thing that only advances evil interests. Like, Widevine should never have been made a thing in Firefox imo.So I think what's most productive here is to build immutable, signable systems that can preserve user freedom, and then use social and political means to further guarantee those freedoms. For instance a requirement that owning a device means being able to provision your own keys. Bans on certain attestation schemes. Etc.

My suggestion would be not to take the systemd approach. There is no reason why attestation related features can't be turned on or off at install time, much like disk encryption. I find it unfortunate that even something like secureboot isn't configurable at install time, with custom certs,distro certs, or certs generated at install time.Being against a feature that benefits regular users is not good, it is more constructive to talk about what the FOSS way of implementing a feature might be.

That will eventually force users to make a choice between being denied essential services and accepting these demands.I also think AI would substantially curtail the effect of many of these anti-user efforts.

But, if remote device attestation continues to be pushed and we continue to have less and less control and ownership over our devices, I definitely see a world where I now carry two phones. One running something like GrapheneOS, connected to my own self-hosted services, and a separate \"approved\" phone to interact with public and essential services as they require crap like play integrity, etc.But at the end of the day, I still fail see why this is even a need. Governments, banks, other entities have been providing services over the web for decades at this point with little issue. Why are we catering to tech illiteracy (by restricting ownership) instead of promoting tech education and encouraging people to both learn, and importantly, take responsibility for their own actions and the consequences of those actions.\"Someone fell for a scam and drained their bank account\" isn't a valid reason to start locking down everyone's devices.",

And this is done via API, so any app in collusion with any license server can start acquiring traceable smartphone serials.Using Widevine for this purpose breaks Google's ToS but you would need to catch an app doing it (and also intercept the license server's certificate) and then prove it which may be all but impossible as an app doing it could just have a remote code execution \"vulnerability\" and request Widevine license requests in a targeted or infrequent fashion.

Full zero knowledge attestation isn't practical as a single compromised key would give rise to a service that would serve everyone.  The solution first adopted by the TCG (TPM specification v1.1) required a trusted third-party, namely a privacy certificate authority (privacy CA). Each TPM has an embedded RSA key pair called an Endorsement Key (EK) which the privacy CA is assumed to know. In order to attest the TPM generates a second RSA key pair called an Attestation Identity Key (AIK). It sends the public AIK, signed by EK, to the privacy CA who checks its validity and issues a certificate for the AIK. (For this to work, either a) the privacy CA must know the TPM's public EK a priori, or b) the TPM's manufacturer must have provided an endorsement certificate.) The host/TPM is now able to authenticate itself with respect to the certificate. This approach permits two possibilities to detecting rogue TPMs: firstly the privacy CA should maintain a list of TPMs identified by their EK known to be rogue and reject requests from them, secondly if a privacy CA receives too many requests from a particular TPM it may reject them and blocklist the TPMs EK. The number of permitted requests should be subject to a risk management exercise. This solution is problematic since the privacy CA must take part in every transaction and thus must provide high availability whilst remaining secure. Furthermore, privacy requirements may be violated if the privacy CA and verifier collude. Although the latter issue can probably be resolved using blind signatures, the first remains.\n\n\nAFAIK no one uses blind signatures. It would enable the formation of commercial attestation farms.",

      "abstract": "该讨论围绕亚马逊关闭其Fresh和Go实体店的新闻展开。核心话题聚焦于亚马逊无人零售技术的实际效果、实体店运营问题及其对社区的影响。\n\n有用户指出，亚马逊宣称的“Just Walk Out”全自动技术实际上依赖大量人工审核交易，这与宣传的完全自动化形象不符。也有用户分享亲身经历，认为Go商店的购物体验流畅且能有效防范盗窃，但Fresh商店则常出现管理混乱、商品过期等问题，实用性不强。\n\n讨论中提到，部分用户认为这类商店定位尴尬：Fresh商店既不如传统超市齐全，也不如便利店便捷；Go商店虽技术新颖，但商品价格并未因效率提升而降低，且营业时间限制影响了便利性。此外，有用户批评亚马逊为开店而驱逐本地商户，最终却留下闲置店面，对社区造成负面影响。\n\n共识方面，多数用户对亚马逊关闭这些商店并不意外，认为其运营模式存在缺陷。分歧主要在于对技术体验的评价：有人认为自动化流程高效可靠，也有人质疑其实际成本与宣传不符，并担忧其对就业和社区生态的长期影响。",

          "content": "> On April 4, 2024, it was revealed that Amazon's \"Just Walk Out\" technology was supported by approximately 1,000 Indian workers who manually reviewed transactions. Despite claims of being fully automated through computer vision, a significant portion of transactions required this manual verification. ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amazon_Go )Wonder how much of this is due to economics since computer vision tech never reached the expected performance + outsourced workers got (relatively) much more expensive after COVID.",

          "content": "I left the following comment some months ago, duplicating it here:[Disclaimer: Former Amazon employee and not involved with Go since 2016.]I worked on the first iteration of Amazon Go in 2015/16 and can provide some context on the human oversight aspects.The system incorporated human review in two primary capacities:1. Low-confidence event resolution: A subset of customer interactions resulted in low-confidence classifications that were routed to human reviewers for verification. These events typically involved edge cases that were challenging for the automated systems to resolve definitively. The proportion of these events was expected to decrease over time as the models improved. This was my experience during my time with Go.2. Training data generation: Human annotators played a significant role in labeling interactions for model training-- particularly when introducing new store fixtures or customer behaviors. For instance, when new equipment like coffee machines were added, the system would initially flag all related interactions for human annotation to build training datasets for those specific use cases. Of course, that results in a surge of humans needed for annotation while the data is collected.Scaling from smaller grab-and-go formats to larger retail environments (Fresh, Whole Foods) would require expanded annotation efforts due to the increased complexity and variety of customer interactions in those settings.This approach represents a fairly standard machine learning deployment pattern where human oversight serves both quality assurance and continuous improvement.The news story is entertaining but it implies there was no working tech behind Amazon Go which just isn't true.",

You constantly have to work around employees fulfilling online orders and they aren’t helpful.  I always find expired groceries/produce on the shelf so I have to spend a lot of extra time inspecting each item.  The only reason I put up with their nonsense is that some of their prices are insane and they have easy returns, for example $0.85 for a box of Barilla pasta. They actually don’t accept returns in store and just refund you automatically in the app (Returnless returns).  It’s pretty silly and rife for abuse.I also found a loophole with the Amazon.com return grocery credit.  The systems are separate for the $10 off $40 coupon and you just scan a QR code in the store to get it. It  turns out you can just take a photo of their QR code and reuse it over and over again.",

It was honestly a rather flawless experience for me and I liked it because the scan gate and minders (it was when it launched - I don't know if they kept them) kept the shoplifters out. Shoplifters are unpleasant to share a store with. Unsurprisingly, those who skip some social norms also skip other ones.Anyway, I didn't go back after the first time because it was more like a corner store than a grocery store. Bags of chips and sandwiches in plastic boxes and so on. Overall, the modern Whole Foods is a much better experience. Guards at the entrance to keep unpleasant people out, a fairly quick check-out experience, and the ability to scan your palm instead of having to pull out a credit card or tap your watch.About the only improvement that I would personally like is a Fast Shopper bonus where you scan something that maps you to your Amazon Prime profile and if you finish checking out fast you get access to a faster lane. The only downside is when people with large bags of things insist on using the self check-out counters and then stand there having mis-scanned items.Speeding up check-out is a personal life improvement but realistically it would not cause me to shop more, so I understand discontinuing the store.",

Initially you had to \"scan in\" and \"scan out\" and then they eventually removed the \"scan out\" (or scan in? can't remember). From a shopper's perspective, it was pretty good, and I was hopeful they'd figure out the tech.  One time they overcharged me for a paper bag and there was no way to dispute it. It was only $0.08, but really rubbed me the wrong way. I know I got a fair bit of stuff for free as they seemed to err on the side of not charging vs. charging if they weren't able to figure it out, though.I actually did find it saved me time. I would go in, grab a couple things, and leave, and it was actually a good experience to do that. I never did full grocery store runs there, though.The aisles were always packed with workers picking/packing orders, which was frustrating to deal with.One thing that was bad about it was that produce was all fixed price. At a normal store you pay per pound for an onion, but there every onion was $1 (or whatever the price was). Giant onion, tiny onion, all the same price. The produce got picked over in weird ways because of that.Then one day they said, \"okay, Just Walk Out is gone, it's just a normal grocery store now.\" Then it just became just a mediocre grocery store. There were definitely periods where aisles could be nearly empty, but lately it's been okay. Prices were great, though -- by far the cheapest in the area.Their hot bar was extremely mediocre. I like the Whole Foods one, but theirs was just... not good. Half the time they didn't even have it stocked with food.They had a little stand up front where kids could get a free piece of fruit, which mine liked.It also had convenient returns for Amazon purchases, which was about half of what I went there for.It was a convenient place for me, and I like it better than Safeway, but I can't say I'm too heartbroken that it's going away. QFC/Sprouts/Town&Country/Safeway are a few minutes in any direction, but they're more expensive. I doubt they'll turn this one into a Whole Foods either.",

A big weekly food order for a family of four? All of your groceries won't fit in their special cart because it needs room for the scale and the scanners.The prices are indeed pretty insane and the produce is always great, but the stores are ghost towns most of the time.

One example was a submission their undergraduate affiliation (in accounting) to submit a paper on cosmology, entirely vibe-coded and vibe-written. This just wastes our (already stretched) time. A significant fraction of submissions are now vibe-written and come from folks who are looking to 'boost' their CV (even having a 'submitted' publication is seen as a benefit), which is really not the point of these journals at all.I'm not sure I'm convinced of the benefit of lowering the barrier to entry to scientific publishing. The hard part always has been, and always will be, understanding the research context (what's been published before) and producing novel and interesting work (the underlying research).

Obviously, they don't give a damn about Overleaf’s market, which is a drop in the bucket. What OpenAI is after -- I think -- it’s a very specific kind of “training data.” Not Overleaf’s finished papers (those are already public), but the entire workflow. The path from a messy draft to a polished paper captures how ideas actually form: the back-and-forth, the false starts, the collaborative refinement at the frontier of knowledge. That’s an unusually distilled form of cognitive work, and I could imagine that's something one would want in order to train advanced models how to think.Keeping LaTeX as the language is a feature, not a bug: it filters out noise and selects for people trained in STEM, who’ve already learned how to think and work scientifically.",

On the one hand, remote LaTeX compiling gets expensive at scale. On the other hand, it's only a fraction of a drop in the bucket compared to OpenAI's total compute needs.

While there may have been administrative reasons for the citation minimum, the concept behind them is not unfounded, though they are probably not the most effective way of achieving that goal.While similar, the function is fundamentally different from citations appearing in research.

Even if it weren't, it's still always been more locked down than a standard desktop or laptop machine running an operating system of the user's choice.With the advent of smartphones and tablets, already I see non- and semi-technical users often dropping their laptop or desktop and just using their phone or tablet.  (I know people who don't even have a laptop/desktop anymore.)Android having a full desktop interface will just add fuel to this fire, and further normalize running a locked-down OS and device that users don't truly own or control as their only computing platform.",

          "content": "Unless Google reorganizes and gets more focused, I'd say they are highly likely to repeat their mistakes.IMHO both Apple and Google are missing a big opportunity here. Both are doing work to blur the lines between desktop and mobile. Both are targeting laptops, ar, phones, and tablets.These are multiple modalities. Or they should be. But because the way both are structured, these are isolated islands with some interoperability but the whole experience is very device centric.What's nicer is when you have multiple devices and a clean handover between them. You basically sign in and all your apps and data are there. All the open apps have the same state. They just adapt to the formfactor.Apple has been taking babysteps here but it's still hopelessly compartmentalizing the market. So switching between devices is a lot of setup and install friction.And for Google, they've been banging the drum that everything is cloud based since forever. Yet they can't figure out a cross device UX that makes sense. It should be as simple as sign in and all your stuff is there. That was the vision with ChromeOS at some point but then they lost interest, got distracted by Fuchsia, went off and created Flutter and also forgot that Android was the thing that actually has an enormous amount of users and OEMs shipping it.The trillion dollar opportunity here: if devices become like shoes, many people probably have more than one. Some people have many pairs of shoes for different occasions. But they have only one phone. Because switching between devices is painful. Adding another OS to the mix just kicks that can down the road. Multi device, multi modal access to your stuff is the key thing that they should be nailing. If e.g. Apple were to nail that, some people might have many different devices in different sizes and form factors. The main decision as to which one to use would be based on which is most appropriate for the context.If you take something like that as the starting point, the logical conclusion is that Google should evolve Android to run on any type of device and make sure that everything plays nice together. Switching between your Android phone(s), tablet, TVs, car, AR/VR goggles, or laptops should not be hard. Devices running a version of Android exist in all those categories. But there's very little/no integration across these.",

The other 99.999+% would not (yet) have to pay a wealth tax. However, the <0.001% that (esp. the wealthiest among them) who would pay the wealth tax would be motivated to move.Unfortunately for California about 40% of the total state income tax collected (which accounts for about 65% of the state general fund) is paid by the top 1% of income earners -- which includes those 0.001% who will be motivated to move by a wealth tax (or even merely the threat of one).The <0.001% number appears to be based on population _before_ several billionaires moved out before Jan 1, 2026 - likely at least partially motivated by the small, but real, risk of the \"billionaire's tax\" qualifying for the ballot and passing (and that proposed tax is only \"temporary\" and is only a total of 5% over three years so isn't nearly as alarming to the wealthy as a \"permanent\" tax would be). If it looks like this measure will end up on the ballot and have a chance of passing, expect many more to leave. This will, even if it does not ultimately pass, erode the income tax base.California has rebelled against wealth taxes in the past - most notably by the passage of Prop 13 almost 50 years ago (a property tax is a wealth tax). They are not popular except when the hit \"the other guy\" -- but \"the other guy\" is the one most able to avoid the tax.Wealthy people are typically very flexible as to where they live. They often already own multiple homes and often spend a lot of time out of the state they \"live\" in. When they move, they are not packing and labeling their own boxes or are likely even present on \"moving day\". They also are more likely to set up HQ and shop near where they spend a lot of their time. Even if they have family in California, they can still get together with them for Thanksgiving dinner -- either by flying the family to them on their private and chartered jets or by themselves flying to California for the weekend on one of their jets. They can conduct most business very efficiently remotely and often do so now to a significant extent.It only takes a few to leave to tank the California budget - likely causing the progressive income and wealth taxes to reach deeper and deeper into the upper middle classes as California desperately tries to balance their budget without cutting yet more programs.Other states are loving this though and will cut tax deals to attract these very billionaires that California are encouraging to leave.",

The fact that, while producing these side effects, the machine also leads to massive wealth accumulation among a small number of people is another side effect that basically has nothing to do with the core tasks of the economy.  The question now is how to evaluate this additional side effect.  If it does not have any negative consequences, it can be ignored.  If it does, it should be counteracted.It's like in a combustion engine.  Oil has to be added for the engine to work.  But over time, dirt particles, metal abrasion, soot, and combustion residues accumulate in the oil, overwhelming the oil filter and reducing its lubricating ability.  If you don't reset it to a “healthy” basic state at regular intervals, it gets so bad that it prevents the engine from operating and ultimately even destroys it.Does the massive wealth inequality we see today cause problems that lead to the erosion of society itself?  I would say yes, definitely.  Of course, it is frustrating for these people when the money they have generated is taken away from them. But let's look at it realistically: if someone has $100 billion and $99 billion is taken away from them, they are still in a situation where they lack nothing financially.At some point, you've played capitalism through to the final level.  And then you should put down the controller and go outside to listen to the birds chirping instead of frantically chasing after the growth of a number that, due to its sheer size, no longer has any concrete meaning, apart from the fact that there may be two other people whose numbers are bigger or who are hot on your heels.",

Not to benefit businesses or a tiny sliver of the population.That’s why we have everything from income taxes to interstate highways: to distribute wealth and resources to (a flawed approximation of, but it’s still the goal) everyone in the country.

If archeologists have large uncertainty whether human ancestors made tools 500,000 years back or not, then they shouldn't be surprised upon finding evidence that the ancestors did.I don't know any specifics about this case, just arguing that that kind of wording by itself is not always wrong by default.",

We didn't spontaneously use tools, it must have evolved incrementally in some way.I think we see shades of this today.

From a brief documentary clip I saw [0], they first take the nut and strip away the outer layer of skin, leave it dry out in the sun for a week, then find a large soft-ish rock as the anvil with a heavier smaller rock to break open the nut. So they had to not only figure out that nuts need to be pre-shelled and dried, but that they needed a softer rock for the anvil and harder rock for the hammer. They also need at least some type of bipedal ability to carry the rock in the first place and use it as a hammer.Apparently some white-faced Capuchins have figured out that they can soak nuts in water to soften it before hammering it open [1].[0] https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFWTXU2jE14[1] https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N7sJq2XUiy8",

When software was physically distributed back in the day, 15% of the MSRP was reserved for the distributor and another 15% for the retailer. When these digital marketplaces were set up, the companies just said \"well, we're the distributor and the retailer, so we'll keep both\". Forgetting the fact that the cost to distribute and retail the software is literally pennies on the dollar of what it used to be.I think the irony in this case is that this is a greed problem of their own making. When Steve Jobs announced that apps on the original iPhone would only be $1-$3, he set off the first enshittification crisis in the software industry. In 2008, Bejeweled cost $19.99 if you wanted to buy it on the PC. On the iPhone it was $0.99!

E.g., the \"Settings\" tab always has an \"unread\" alert on it reminding me that I have not made the \"recommended\" change.Now they're going to force everyone to switch, and they're blaming Apple for it. And, to be clear, fuck Apple, but also fuck Patreon, this is their choice and it's going to mean that I can no longer use their service.Here's a support request I just sent them, again, after clicking 15 levels deep into their FAQ before finding the thing that might contact a human. Since the email alerting me of this change came from a \"noreply\" address because of course it did.Feel free to send your own:---Subject: Subscription billing is unacceptableYou recently sent mail saying that you're going to force me to switch from monthly billing to subscription billing.Subscription billing is unacceptable for my Patreon. It does not work.I sell monthly memberships to a physical nightclub. The memberships begin on the first of the month. I fulfill and mail the physical membership cards on the first of the month. If you make me switch to daily billing, that means I will have to do merch fulfillment on a daily basis instead, and I simply cannot do that.If you force me to switch from a monthly cycle to a daily cycle I will have no choice but to stop using Patreon.To be clear: I do not give a shit about the iOS app. Not one fractional fuck is given. If the solution to this problem is that people cannot sign up for, or access, my Patreon from the iOS app, that is 100% acceptable to me.I know for a fact that none -- zero, 0% -- of my patrons have signed up using the iOS app. I know this because I had to warn them away from it, due to the 30% Apple Tax, and all of them complied. All of them. The iOS app is utterly meaningless to me and to my patrons.(Also you are blaming this on Apple's bullying, which is simply not credible. You've been nagging me to change to subscription billing for years, with the little red error icon appearing everywhere. This is your decision. You are transparently using Apple as an excuse.)---I said this same thing to you a year and a half ago, the last time you tried to pull this nonsense. Second verse, same as the first.\nLast time, support replied that they \"completely get why this change would be upsetting\" and \"will bring my feedback to the team.\" Uh huh.Patreon's absolutely awful level of service and support has been a huge problem for quite some time, but I am really not looking forward to having to figure out how to implement recurring monthly billing on my own.Patreon, YOU HAD ONE JOB.[0] https://www.jwz.org/blog/2026/01/patreon-is-lying-again-and-...",

I read a printed weekly publication (in my case The Economist) on Sunday morning. Outside of Sunday morning I don't read the news at all.I prefer printed news to media-supported news, because I think the imagery (I acknowledge The Economist still has images) and presentation of news, especially on TV detracts from the message it's trying to convey a lot of the time. After reading some of Neil Postman's books (notably Amusing Ourselves to Death), I find it strange to watch televised news whereby one minute I'm watching footage of a disaster, then the next minute I'm seeing sports news updates or an advert. Just like normal learning, I think news demands longer form content for proper understanding.Reading the news on a low frequency basis also gives time for news stories to properly develop. Breaking news can be filled with speculation and incorrect details, which even if you keep up with, you can miss later corrections or crucial details. Not to mention the stress involved in it. Chances are if some real breaking news happens, like a natural disaster or war, I'll hear somebody else tell me.",

From a business perspective, the articles and opinion pieces were just bait to draw in a particular class of reader; the real money came from advertising to those particular classes of reader.The web has destroyed that business model, because the news industry now controls far less advertising space, so there is no longer enough advertising revenue to support quality journalism. The broadsheets are in real financial trouble, and most have turned to tabloid-style articles (albeit ones that promote more sophisticated worldviews) in order to pull in those social-media clicks.I find myself increasingly interested in publications like The Economist and The Financial Times, simply because their readerships have financial interest in actually knowing what's going on in the world, and so they can charge a subscription price that supports quality journalism.",

Along with the reporters, I was involved in many parts of the final decisions that made the news mellowed/changed when printed in the Paper in the morning, making it more consumable for readers. I have seen photos of bloodshed and mutilations that trained my brain to normalize rotten.com in later years of my life. The ones printed in the morning paper were always curated; the ones that got away unprinted were things we would keep under key and lock.More than a decade ago, I stopped following general news and learn about things asynchronously. However, I had picked up a few topics that I like to follow and do follow them. Since the Pandemic, I had settled on just a few niche areas of Tech and Science to follow — which, of course, quite a few of them land on Hacker News when I submit them.Around the end of 2025, I picked up the actual printed Physical Newspaper again. A lot of the news seems like yesterday’s Jam to me. I’m going to continue reading the newspaper, Slow and Smooth, picking the ones I want to read and ignoring everything else.https://brajeshwar.com/2026/newspaper/",

A few examples come to mind: not being proactive and creative when it comes to taking care of my house and family, not being present when playing with my son, being less productive at work, and literally feeling angry after consuming news — like the feeling after eating fast food and having bloating.

And something I think will be lost as we move more and more toward vibe coding.There is so much to be learned about a problem - and programming in general - by implementing stuff and then refactoring it into the ground. Most of the time the abstractions I think up at first are totally wrong. Like, I imagine my program will model categories A, B and C. But when I program it up, the code for B and C is kinda similar. So I combine them, and realise C is just a subset of B. And sometimes then I realise A is a distinct subset of B as well, and I rewrite everything. Or sometimes I realise B and C differ in one dimension, and A and B in another. And that implies there's a fourth kind of thing with both properties.Do this enough and your code ends up in an entirely unrecognisable place from where you started. But very, very beautiful.",

A hypothetical version of events, just one of many possible scenarios of course:\n 1) Important communications required by law and/or regulation are sent by email.\n2) Contacting customers via email is sometimes unreliable. It is unreliable enough that problems caused by missed emails caused enough pain in some exec's silo that they demanded a solution.\n3) \"Make sure people read their email\" isn't really an actionable demand. The business knows this, so they turned to IT.\n4) \"Make sure people read their email\" isn't really technically feasible either, but at this point it's not about making sure that the customer got the message: it's about making sure that the company is covered if a customer complains about missing communications.\n5) To that end, a variety of technical solutions are proposed, and everyone knows that they're all bad or incomplete. The tracking pixel is chosen because it's at the intersection of \"least bad\" and \"lowest effort to implement.\"\n6) Around now, someone probably pointed out the issue with serving the content over http, but changing that requires buy-in from another team. It'll go to their product manager as an inject and maybe get prioritized for next PI (it won't, something more important will come up between now and then).\n7) The tracking pixel ships. The team that implemented it stresses that this is an incomplete solution and the business really needs to re-evaluate their processes around customer communications.\n8) The email tracking pixel solution gets a bullet point on a slide in a presentation given to managers 3-5 levels higher than the devs who made it. No one mentions that the solution is incomplete and requires additional work and investment. No one ever thinks of it again.",

Success speaks for itself. In TV, software, e-commerce, statins, ED pills, modern smartphones, social media, etc… winning products went into the black quickly and made their companies shitloads of money (profits). No need to adjust vibes, they could just flip everyone the bird from atop their mountains of cash. (Which can also be pretty funny.)There are mountains of cash in LLMs today too, but so far they’re mostly on the investment side of the ledger. And industry-wide nervousness about that is pretty easy to discern. Like the loud guy with a nervous smile and a drop of sweat on his brow.https://youtu.be/wni4_n-Cmj4So much of the current discourse around AI is the tech-builders begging the rest of the world to find a commercially valuable application. Like the AgentForce commercials that have to stoop to showing Matthew McConaughey suffering the stupidest problems imaginable.

So yes, open source will be able to keep up from a pure performance standpoint, but you can imagine a future state where only licensed models are able to be used in commercial settings and licensing will require compliance against limiting subversive use or similar (e.g. sexualization of minors, doesn't let you make a bomb etc.).When the market shifts to a more compliance-relevant world, I think the Labs will have a monopoly on all of the research, ops, and production know-how required to deliver. That's not even considering if Agents truly take off (which will then place a premium on the servicing of those agents and agent environments rather than just the deployment).There's a lot of assumptions in the above, and the timelines certainly vary, so its far from a sure thing - but the upside definitely seems there to me.",

It is far more likely that specific jobs in specific industries will be taken by AI, and AI will slowly take the labor market. This will drive down prices on products, services, and labor. Once human labor's price is low, and once many product prices are low, the overall employment level of humans will rise.

A substantial chunk of Americans, i.e. a huge portion of evangelicals, devoutly believe a few things:* The Bible book of \"Revelations\" is an accurate prediction of things that will happen exactly as described.* Revelations predicts that in \"the end times\", it will become impossible to buy or sell anything without \"the mark of the beast\" on their forehead or right hand.* The \"mark of the beast\" would be administered by the Antichrist.From Revelations 13:16-17:\"And the second beast required all people, small and great, rich and poor, free and slave, to receive a mark on their right hand or on their forehead, so that no one could buy or sell unless he had the mark—the name of the beast or the number of its name.\"I grew up in an extremely religious part of the US with a large evangelical population, and I know firsthand that a lot of people believe that all of the above is literally, precisely true. It's exactly what I was taught in Sunday School as a kid. I do not believe this; please don't feel the need to tell me why these ideas are not true because I already agree with you. However, a lot of my family and old neighbors would 100% agree with all of the above statements.And yet, they seemed to have no problem with buying stuff from Amazon with a palm print, or using Sam Altman's creepy Orb eye scanner thing.

A few days later, he actually responded enthusiastically and mentioned an upcoming trip to the UK. He loved the grassroots nature of the meetup and was really up for giving a talk (for free!) to the community. I then had multiple delightful interactions with his wife who managed his logistics.Devastatingly he fell ill just before his trip and had to withdraw. Fortunately we hadn't announced anything however I still mourn over the missed opportunity to be able to introduce this living legend to our audience!",

Perhaps we (or people?) might affiliate him more with Hackernews given he was co-founder of a company which many founders within HN might want to achieve (or replicate?)But the other way I view HN is a place of curiosity, a place of tinkering. I saw the interview of Ken Thompson and I don't know about you guys, but Ken Thompson talked in his interview about how when he was in between houses at a hotel when he was in high school, and there were girls who he used to wave at so he was half-way through to making essentially a pixelated device through which he could write letters (from what I remember from his interview)I personally have done something similar although from a software side and not with a hardware side. But I feel like after 70 years, the transition from hardware to software is one which is understandable :)I mean... Ken's 80 year old and really sharp. I only saw him thinking about things literally 70 year old just once almost like loading things into his mind at the start of interview and he was effortless afterwards talking about it.I don't know enough about wozniak to qualify him for thisBut what I can say was that today I was watching the Ken Thompson interview and literally after 15-30 minutes of the 4 hour interview. I was like, this belongs on hackernews and submitted it here. (Not sure if this counts as promotion but seriously everyone just watch this interview of Ken Thompson!)Video link: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=309siTvApbYHackernews discussion I submitted (Currently zero response after 8 hours tho) [https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46793919] Kenneth Lane Thompson, 1983 ACM Turing Award Recipient (Video Interview)SO I don't know if there's a particular reason why my HN submission about got literally 0 response after 8 hours or if because of it, Ken Thompson wouldn't qualify for it. But I am gonna be honest and say that in my mind, Ken Thompson's the legend which really embodies the HN spirit. Not sure if other parts of HN community also feel so but I still feel that they do even though there was no response on the HN post (could just be the timing at what I posted and many other things) but yea.I highly recommend everyone to go watch the interview if you have 4-5 hours of free time right now.",

They can't be deployed or committed with obvious parse errors or ambiguities around quoting or typos in variable names.In the case of the scripts that are tools for developers, the Bash interpreter, coreutils, and all external commands are provided by Nix, which hardcodws their full path into the scripts. The scripts don't care if you're on Linux or macOS— they don't even care what's on your PATH (or if it's empty).

It started when we migrated to Docker more than a decade ago - before docker-compose was a thing, building and running a set of containers required quite a bit of shell scripting, and we decided to use Make for that. Make is ubiquitous, cross-platform, the targets are essentially snippets of shell with some additional features/syntax added on top, there's a dependency system (you can naturally express things like \"if you want to run X, you need to build Z and Y first, then X, then you can run it\"), it allows for easy parameterization (`make <target> ARG=val`), plus it's actually Turing-complete language with first-class lambdas and capacity for self-modifying code[1]. And when some rule becomes too complex, it's trivial to dump it into `scripts/something.sh` and have Make call it. Rewriting the script in another language also works, and Make still provides dependencies between targets.TL;DR: Make is a very nice tool for gathering the \"auxiliary\" scripts needed for a project in a language-agnostic manner. It's better than setup.py and package.json precisely because it provides a single interface for projects of both kinds.[1] Which is worth knowing so you can avoid both features like the plague.",

      "content": "Hey HN, we're the co-founders of LemonSlice (try our HN playground here: https://lemonslice.com/hn). We train interactive avatar video models. Our API lets you upload a photo and immediately jump into a FaceTime-style call with that character. Here's a demo: https://www.loom.com/share/941577113141418e80d2834c83a5a0a9Chatbots are everywhere and voice AI has taken off, but we believe video avatars will be the most common form factor for conversational AI. Most people would rather watch something than read it. The problem is that generating video in real-time is hard, and overcoming the uncanny valley is even harder.We haven’t broken the uncanny valley yet. Nobody has. But we’re getting close and our photorealistic avatars are currently best-in-class (judge for yourself: https://lemonslice.com/try/taylor). Plus, we're the only avatar model that can do animals and heavily stylized cartoons. Try it: https://lemonslice.com/try/alien. Warning! Talking to this little guy may improve your mood.Today we're releasing our new model* - Lemon Slice 2, a 20B-parameter diffusion transformer that generates infinite-length video at 20fps on a single GPU - and opening up our API.How did we get a video diffusion model to run in real-time? There was no single trick, just a lot of them stacked together. The first big change was making our model causal. Standard video diffusion models are bidirectional (they look at frames both before and after the current one), which means you can't stream.From there it was about fitting everything on one GPU. We switched from full to sliding window attention, which killed our memory bottleneck. We distilled from 40 denoising steps down to just a few - quality degraded less than we feared, especially after using GAN-based distillation (though tuning that adversarial loss to avoid mode collapse was its own adventure).And the rest was inference work: modifying RoPE from complex to real (this one was cool!), precision tuning, fusing kernels, a special rolling KV cache, lots of other caching, and more. We kept shaving off milliseconds wherever we could and eventually got to real-time.We set up a guest playground for HN so you can create and talk to characters without logging in: https://lemonslice.com/hn. For those who want to build with our API (we have a new LiveKit integration that we’re pumped about!), grab a coupon code in the HN playground for your first Pro month free ($100 value). See the docs: https://lemonslice.com/docs. Pricing is usage-based at $0.12-0.20/min for video generation.Looking forward to your feedback!EDIT: Tell us what characters you want to see in the comments and we can make them for you to talk to (e.g. Max Headroom)*We did a Show HN last year for our V1 model: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43785044.

I built my career on knowing it well and using it daily for a decade, so I’m biased.Pandas created the modern Python data stack when there was not really any alternatives (except R and closed source). The original split-apply-combine paradigm was well thought out, simple, and effective, and the built in tools to read pretty much anything (including all of your awful csv files and excel tables) and deal with timestamps easily made it fit into tons of workflows. It pioneered a lot, and basically still serves as the foundation and common format for the industry.I always recommend every member of my teams read Modern Pandas by Tom Augspurger when they start, as it covers all the modern concepts you need to get data work done fast and with high quality. The concepts carry over to polars.And I have to thank the pandas team for being a very open and collaborative bunch. They’re humble and smart people, and every PR or issue I’ve interacted with them on has been great.Polars is undeniably great software, it’s my standard tool today. But they did benefit from the failures and hard edges of pandas, pyspark, dask, the tidyverse, and xarray. It’s an advantage pandas didn’t have, and they still pay for.I’m not trying to take away from polars at all. It’s damn fast — the benchmarks are hard to beat. I’ve been working on my own library and basically every optimization I can think of is already implemented in polars.I do have a concern with their VC funding/commercialization with cloud. The core library is MIT licensed, but knowing they’ll always have this feauture wall when you want to scale is not ideal. I think it limits the future of the library a lot, and I think long term someone will fill that niche and the users will leave.",

For me it all clicked when I first looped through a pile of Excel files (pd.read_excel()), extracted info I needed and wrote a new Excel file... Mind blown.From there, of course, you slowly start to learn about types etc, and slowly you start to appreciate libraries and IDEs. But I knew tables, and statistics and graphs, and Pandas (with the visual style of Notebooks) lead me to programming via that familiar world. At first with some frustration about Pandas and needing to write to Excel, do stuff, and read again, but quickly moving into the opposite flow, where Excel itself became the limiting factor and being annoyed when having to use it.I offered some \"Programming for Biologists\" courses, to teach people like me to do programming in this way, because it would be much less \"dry\" (pd.read.excel().barplot() and now you're programming). So far, wherever I offered the courses they said they prefer to teach programming \"from the base up\". Ah well! I've been told I'm not a programmer, I don't care. I solve problems (and that is the only way I am motivated enough to learn, I can't sit down solving LeetCode problems for hours, building exactly nothing).(To be clear, I now do the Git, the Vim, the CI/CD, the LLM, the Bash, The Linux,  the Nix, the Containers...

As a Django dev I only just discovered the rest of the world has invented testcontainers, and databases as a solution for a problem Django solved years ago with it's test database support.I quite like the traditional setup where you have settings/common.py and then settings that extend that - e.g local.puy production.pyIf you ever need a CMS in your Django project I strongly recommend Wagtail, it came after the initially most popular django-cms and learned a lot of lessons - feeling much more like a part of Django.It has the same feeling of being productive as Django does when you first use it.",

That’s the last time I used it anyway.The situation is worse than that because any plugins usually define their own settings which also don’t validate their contents.I think something centralised that lets you properly scope and validate settings would be nice.

However, certain breaches are particularly sensitive in that someone's presence in the breach may adversely impact them if others are able to find that they were a member of the site. These breaches are classed as \"sensitive\" and may not be publicly searched.A sensitive data breach can only be searched by the verified owner of the email address being searched for. This is done by signing in to the dashboard which involves verifying you can receive an email to the entered address. Once signed in, all breaches (including sensitive ones) are visible in the \"Breaches\" section under \"Personal\".There are presently 82 sensitive breaches in the system including Adult FriendFinder (2015), Adult FriendFinder (2016), Adult-FanFiction.Org, Ashley Madison, Beautiful People, Bestialitysextaboo, Brazzers, BudTrader, Carding Mafia (December 2021), Carding Mafia (March 2021), Catwatchful, CityJerks, Cocospy, Color Dating, CrimeAgency vBulletin Hacks, CTARS, CyberServe, Date Hot Brunettes, DC Health Link, Doxbin and 62 more.[1] https://haveibeenpwned.com/FAQs#SensitiveBreach",

How can I be sure they respect the new limits once I do pay, instead of upselling me the next plan in line?Adding to that things like the general jankiness or the never-ending spam from “get more fake listeners for $$$” accounts (which seem to be in an obvious symbiosis with the platform, boosting the numbers for optics), the last year’s ambiguous change in ToS allowing them to train ML systems on your work, it was enough for me to drop it. Thankfully, it was a trial run and I did not publish any pending releases.If you still publish on SoundCloud, and you do original music (as opposed to publishing, say, DJ sets, where dealing with IP is problematic), ask yourself whether it is timr to grow up and do proper publishing!",

          "content": "This is great.  Thank you for building and sharing it.May I request you to consider moving this project to a community organisation like https://github.com/<your-new-org> so that we, the HN folks, can maintain it as a community?  Curated list projects often start with a lot of enthusiasm and I follow several similar ones focused on personal websites and blogs. While some of the curators remain active and maintain their project even years later, some do not.  This isn't a complaint.  I know life happens and circumstances change.  So it is understandable that some of these projects become inactive later.But it becomes a little problematic when someone wants to have their creation added to the curated list but cannot do so because the maintainer is no longer active.  Of course, volunteers can fork the project and maintain it as a community but this is easier said than done.  Once a 'Show HN' thread like this becomes successful, future visitors are more likely to end up on the original but no-longer-maintained curated list than the newer community maintained fork.  For that reason, when I created my list of curated personal websites, I did so under the organisation <https://github.com/hnpwd> from the very start, and now we have multiple maintainers and contributors helping out with the curation.Hosting the project under a community org with multiple maintainers could give it a better chance of staying active in the long term.  This is only a request.  I do not mean to impose or pressure you in any way.  Please feel free to ignore the suggestion and thank you again for the work regardless.",

The first one has about 10 unique visitors per day.  Really tiny numbers, but it's a delight that some people out there return to this game regularly. Thank you, whoever you are.Playing computer games is how I was introduced to computers.  I too wanted to develop my own invaders-like game when I was about 8 years old.  Unfortunately, I neither had enough access to computers nor sufficient programming skills at the time.  The first link (invaders.html) is the result of fulfilling that childhood dream 30 years later.Inspired by a few computer games from the early 1980s, the first game also includes an autoplay algorithm.  If you leave the game idle for 5 seconds after loading, the autoplayer kicks in and starts playing the game automatically.Each game is implemented in plain HTML and JavaScript as a single, unminified, easily readable HTML page.  Anyone can download the page, save it locally, play it offline as well as inspect or tweak the source code.",

One is a version of the classic game \"Lemmings\". The other is a very minimal asteroids style inertial ship duel.The games both use deterministic execution in lockstep across network participants, and provide interactive gameplay and smooth execution even if situations with up to quarter or half second lag times, and the methods used for this are then perhaps one interesting aspect of the project.In each game, the local player sees their own controlled entities at current positions, and other player entities at historical positions.In the lemmings game, the complication is that lemmings depend on their own world changes (e.g. they need to stand on a bridge piece they just built). So there is a kind of fork and merge mechanism that enables local and remote world changes to be eventually consistent.In the inertial duel game, homing missiles have a deploy phase in which they transition between different update time frames, with exactly the same sequence of updates applied on each machine, but with these updates accelerated or slowed down to achieve the time frame synchronisation.There is an offline part with a tutorial to go through for the lemmings clone, which gives a flavour of the thing. The networking part uses a dedicated server and is currently invite only, but if anyone is interested in trying this then please shout and I can send out server credentials..",

I really think that agent-driven development is the way for games, especially small games and to prototype gameplay mechanics. You no longer have to worry about how to factor your codebase when you just want to see if some idea works. This is especially the case when you put yourself in the constraints of a little virtual machine where you don't have to care much about assets, which are now definitely the bottleneck for this kind of thing.These games are all unfinished, riddled with bugs, and almost none of them are actually fun (I like Traffic and Shapeship the most) but the thing is that I absolutely loved making them in a way that I haven't enjoyed making anything on a computer in a long while.

The language-specific clients become much simpler and can be maintained by the open source community for each language, e.g. faktory-rs[1]. The drawback is that Faktory is not focused on any one community and it's hard for me to provide idiomatic examples in a given language.It's a different direction but by focusing on a single community, you may have better outcomes, time will tell![0]: https://github.com/contribsys/faktory\n[1]: https://github.com/jonhoo/faktory-rs",

Lots of people will tell you that you shouldn't use a relational database as a worker queue, but they inevitably miss out on how important transactions are for this - it's really useful to be able to say \"queue this work if the transaction commits, don't queue it if it fails\".Brandur Leach wrote a fantastic piece on this a few years ago: https://brandur.org/job-drain - describing how, even if you have a separate queue system, you should still feed it by logging queue tasks to a temporary database table that can be updated as part of those transactions.",

Absurd explores a related design as well: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45797228Overall, it's encouraging to see more people converging on a database-centric approach to durable workflows instead of external orchestrators.

This would help with adoption from other OSS projects, if that's a goal, as the transition from Celery would then be moving from a process pool to a process pool (for most users).

On the other hand, Celery has absolutely no asyncio support at all, which sets the pro feature apart.On the other hand, already released and as you said it's much harder to take a free feature and make it paid.Thanks again for Oban - I used it for a project in Elixir and it was painless.

          "content": "To be more specific,You can't escape momentum exchange. To generate an upward force, the airplane must exert a downward force on the air molecules.An airfoil does this more efficiently than a flat plate, essentially using the top shape to create a low pressure area that sucks the air over the top downwards, imparting the downwards momentum, along with deflecting the air downward on the bottom surface. A flat plate pitched upwards \"stalls\" the air on the top surface, because the air has to travel forward some to fill the gap by the plate moving forward - so this creates a lot of drag as the plate is imparting more forward momentum on the air.The issue is that to analyze lift using momentum, you have to do statisitcal math on a grid of space around the airfoil, which is super complex.  So instead, we use concept of pressure with static and dynamic pressure differences creating lift, because it makes sense to most people learning this, which then all gets rolled up into a plot of lift coefficient vs angle of attack.And as you dive deeper, you learn more analysis tools. For example, there is also another way to analyze performance of an airfoil more accurately, which is called vorticity. If you subtract the average velocity of the airflow around an airfoil, the vector field becomes a circle. In vector math, the total curl of the vector field is directly correlated to the effective lift an airfoil can produce. This method accounts for any shape of the airfoil.But under the hood its all momentum.",

      "abstract": "该讨论围绕AI2发布的“开放编码智能体”展开，核心话题是探讨开源与闭源编码智能体的定义、现状及技术价值。社区观点存在明显分歧：有人认为文章表述不准确，指出其忽略了Meta等机构已开源的高性能模型（如CWM），并强调“智能体”通常指应用框架而非底层模型，因此许多闭源模型实际配有开放框架。也有用户指出，文中提及的Devstral Small 2实为开放权重模型，但系统仍依赖Claude等闭源服务运行，这引发了关于“真正开放”程度的争议。讨论中提到，完全开放的训练流程对推动研究突破具有独特价值，而开放权重模型更利于实际部署。共识在于，社区普遍认可开源生态对技术发展的促进作用，但具体到性能比较和开源定义上仍存在不同解读。",

This meant generating only one rollout per evaluation instance, which follows other papers in the space like SWE-smith and BugPilot. In addition, TTS adds extra inference cost and is reliant on how rollouts are ranked, two confounding factors for deployable models where memory and inference speed are extremely important.Following that line of reasoning, context length is another very large confounding factor. Longer context lengths improve performance - but also result in enormous increases in KV cache size and memory requirements. We decide to control for this in our paper and focus at the 32K context length for 32B size models, a context length that already pushes the bounds of what can be \"deployable\" locally.Still, we evaluate at 64K context length using YARN and are able to outperform CWM's 54% performance (non TTS), which it achieves using 128K context, a substantial increase over what we use. This is also pretty significant because we only ever train at 32K context, but CWM trains for a full 128K.",

There's a whole wall of standards that the supplier must meet, e.g. ISO9000 that your little web-dev shop almost certainly doesn't. They won't buy from a supplier that is likely to go out of business. There's a ton of other criteria that you've got to meet to get the business. If there's any, even the slightest, chance that buying from a business might one day reflect badly on the civil servant in the procurement office, then they won't buy from that business. The civil servant has nothing to lose from saying \"no\" and runs a risk if they say \"yes\".Businesses that do meet these criteria charge like wounded bulls. In part because they know that all the other businesses that the govt could turn to will also charge like wounded bulls.",

(Sadly, the other obstacle was that the clocks only listened for the signal overnight, which improved their chances of detecting the weak broadcast out of far-away Colorado.)",

          "content": "It takes a whole minute for the entire data frame to be transmitted. While 1 bps is great for propagation, WWVB (and it's kin) is a really weak signal to pickup using the tiny antennas these kinds of clocks have. There's a relationship between received power, modulation type, data rate, error correction, and error rate so changing one will change others. Thus it can sometimes take at least several minutes for all of the timing data to be gathered as there is no error correction included in the data frame. Also the HF spectrum is incredibly noisy as switch-mode power supplies (pretty much in everything these days) produce a ton of interference so taking a battery powered clock outside can help greatly.WWVB clocks are great but aren't so good these days. NTP is pretty much as good as anyone will ever need in their home but this has the downside of usually requiring internet access. GPS clocks have been the standard for 30+ years for anyone needing precision timing.",

          "content": "My experience is with Aruduino wiring vs Rust with embassy. And very much from a hobbyist POV.Rust on embedded uses a HAL layer, which is vendor independent (and resolved at compile time, like templates would be in C++). It doesnt cover everything yet, but basics like GPIO, SPI, I2C etc are covered. This avoids the issue of N drivers times M vendor SDKs: I2C drivers can just be written against the HAL, and you instantiate with a specific HAL in your application. Also reduces vendor lock-in. The setup process still requires some chip specific code to select which pins to use etc, but once you are past that you can be vendor neutral.Speaking of which, the API uses some clever patterns (called typestate) to ensure at compile time that your peripheral config is valid: if you \"take\" GPIO2 you can do that again, so you can't give the same pin to two different pieces of code by mistake. And if the driver expects a pin configured as output you can't give an input pin (you can convert a pin to \"dynamic at runtime\" if you really need to, so there is an escape hatch).Then there is the embassy framework. This is an alternative to RTOSes (there are some Rust RTOSes as well, haven't tried them). It makes use of async/await tasks in Rust that are statically allocated and scheduled. You can have several priority levels of schedulers (even though internally the schedulers are cooperative for the tasks inside, but they are preempting between schedulers by using interrupts).Async actually makes many things on embedded easier, such as waiting for a GPIO. No longer do you need to write your own interrupt handler, or figure out when to put the chip on a low power state, the scheduler and HAL futures do it for you.All that said: C++ still is a larger ecosystem with more tutorials, drivers and better chip support. But that is advancing rapidly in the Rust world. ESP32 series has official vendor support in Rust for example, as does at least one or two other vendors (or they are in the process of adding it). Popular chips like the RP2040 etc have support, and I have seen HALs for NRF and ST around (but never played with them). Drivers for common chips exist.So I would say it is worth experimenting with at least, but you should check up front what HALs and drivers exist for what you want to use and check how complete those are. Two years ago I wanted to do I2S things on the ESP32, but that was still missing. A year ago it had support, but some of the DMA things were clunky still. I should check again some time.",

          "content_cn": "我的经验主要涉及Arduino接线与使用embassy框架的Rust编程，且很大程度上是从业余爱好者的视角出发。在嵌入式领域，Rust采用硬件抽象层（HAL），这一层与供应商无关（并在编译时解析，类似于C++中的模板机制）。虽然目前尚未覆盖所有功能，但像GPIO、SPI、I2C等基础模块均已支持。这避免了N种驱动与M家供应商SDK之间的组合问题：例如I2C驱动可以直接基于HAL编写，而在具体应用中只需实例化特定的HAL实现。同时这也有助于减少对特定供应商的依赖。初始设置过程仍需要一些芯片特定的代码来选择引脚等，但一旦完成这部分配置，后续开发便可保持供应商中立性。\n\n值得一提的是，其API采用了一种巧妙的模式（称为类型状态），能在编译阶段确保外设配置的有效性：例如若已“占用”GPIO2引脚，系统会阻止重复占用，从而避免意外将同一引脚分配给不同代码段。若某个驱动要求引脚配置为输出模式，则无法传入输入模式的引脚（若确有需要，可将引脚转换为“运行时动态模式”，因此存在灵活调整的余地）。\n\n此外还有embassy框架。这是实时操作系统的一种替代方案（Rust生态中也有其他RTOS，但我尚未尝试）。该框架利用Rust的异步/等待机制，实现了静态分配和调度的任务管理。系统支持多个优先级的调度器（尽管单个调度器内部采用协作式任务调度，但不同调度器之间会通过中断实现抢占式调度）。异步机制实际上使得……"
