          "content": "Most software engineers are seriously sleeping on how good LLM agents are right now, especially something like Claude Code.Once you’ve got Claude Code set up, you can point it at your codebase, have it learn your conventions, pull in best practices, and refine everything until it’s basically operating like a super-powered teammate. The real unlock is building a solid set of reusable “skills” plus a few agents for the stuff you do all the time.For example, we have a custom UI library, and Claude Code has a skill that explains exactly how to use it. Same for how we write Storybooks, how we structure APIs, and basically how we want everything done in our repo. So when it generates code, it already matches our patterns and standards out of the box.We also had Claude Code create a bunch of ESLint automation, including custom ESLint rules and lint checks that catch and auto-handle a lot of stuff before it even hits review.Then we take it further: we have a deep code review agent Claude Code runs after changes are made. And when a PR goes up, we have another Claude Code agent that does a full PR review, following a detailed markdown checklist we’ve written for it.On top of that, we’ve got like five other Claude Code GitHub workflow agents that run on a schedule. One of them reads all commits from the last month and makes sure docs are still aligned. Another checks for gaps in end-to-end coverage. Stuff like that. A ton of maintenance and quality work is just… automated. It runs ridiculously smoothly.We even use Claude Code for ticket triage. It reads the ticket, digs into the codebase, and leaves a comment with what it thinks should be done. So when an engineer picks it up, they’re basically starting halfway through already.There is so much low-hanging fruit here that it honestly blows my mind people aren’t all over it. 2026 is going to be a wake-up call.(used voice to text then had claude reword, I am lazy and not gonna hand write it all for yall sorry!)Edit: made an example repo for yahttps://github.com/ChrisWiles/claude-code-showcase",

          "content": "I've noticed a huge drop in negative comments on HN when discussing LLMs in the last 1-2 months.All the LLM coded projects I've seen shared so far[1] have been tech toys though. I've watched things pop up on my twitter feed (usually games related), then quietly go off air before reaching a gold release (I manually keep up to date with what I've found, so it's not the algorithm).I find this all very interesting: LLMs dont change the fundamental drives needed to build successful products. I feel like I'm observing the TikTokification of software development. I dont know why people aren't finishing. Maybe they stop when the \"real work\" kicks in. Or maybe they hit the limits of what LLMs can do (so far). Maybe they jump to the next idea to keep chasing the rush.Acquiring context requires real work, and I dont see a way forward to automating that away. And to be clear, context is human needs; i.e. the reasons why someone will use your product. In the game development world, it's very difficult to overstate how much work needs to be done to create a smooth, enjoyable experience for the player.While anyone may be able to create a suite of apps in a weekend, I think very few of them will have the patience and time to maintain them (just like software development before LLMs! i.e. Linux, open source software, etc.).[1] yes, selection bias. There are A LOT of AI devs just marketing their LLMs. Also it's DEFINITELY too early to be certain. Take everything Im saying with a one pound grain of salt.",

          "content": "Author of the post here.I appreciate the spirited debate and I agree with most of it - on both sides. It's a strange place to be where I think both arguments for and against this case make perfect sense. All I have to go on then is my personal experience, which is the only objective thing I've got. This entire profession feels stochastic these days.A few points of clarification...1. I don't speak for anyone but myself. I'm wrong at least half the time so you've been warned.2. I didn't use any fancy workflows to build these things. Just used dictation to talk to GitHub Copilot in VS Code. There is a custom agent prompt toward the end of the post I used, but it's mostly to coerce Opus 4.5 into using subagents and context7 - the only MCP I used. There is no plan, implement - nothing like that. On occasion I would have it generate a plan or summary, but no fancy prompt needed to do that - just ask for it. The agent harness in VS Code for Opus 4.5 is remarkably good.3. When I say AI is going to replace developers, I mean that in the sense that it will do what we are doing now. It already is for me. That said, I think there's a strong case that we will have more devs - not less. Think about it - if anyone with solid systems knowledge can build anything, the only way you can ship more differentiating features than me is to build more of them. That is going to take more people, not more agents. Agents can only scale as far as the humans who manage them.New account because now you know who I am :)",

          "content": "I made a similar comment on a different thread, but I think it also fits here: I think the disconnect between engineers is due to their own context. If you work with frontend applications, specially React/React Native/HTML/Mobile, your experience with LLMs is completely different than the experience of someone working with OpenGL, io_uring, libev and other lower level stuff. Sure, Opus 4.5 can one shot Windows utilities and full stack apps, but can't implement a simple shadowing algorithm from a 2003 paper in C++, GLFW, GLAD: https://www.cse.chalmers.se/~uffe/soft_gfxhw2003.pdfCodex/Claude Code are terrible with C++. It also can't do Rust really well, once you get to the meat of it. Not sure why that is, but they just spit out nonsense that creates more work than it helps me. It also can't one shot anything complete, even though I might feed him the entire paper that explains what the algorithm is supposed to do.Try to do some OpenGL or Vulkan with it, without using WebGPU or three.js. Try it with real code, that all of us have to deal with every day. SDL, Vulkan RHI, NVRHI. Very frustrating.Try it with boost, or cmake, or taskflow. It loses itself constantly, hallucinates which version it is working on and ignores you when you provide actual pointers to documentation on the repo.I've also recently tried to get Opus 4.5 to move the Job system from Doom 3 BFG to the original codebase. Clean clone of dhewm3, pointed Opus to the BFG Job system codebase, and explained how it works. I have also fed it the Fabien Sanglard code review of the job system: https://fabiensanglard.net/doom3_bfg/threading.phpWe are not sleeping on it, we are actually waiting for it to get actually useful. Sure, it can generate a full stack admin control panel in JS for my PostgreSQL tables, but is that really \"not normal\"? That's basic.",

          "content": "Opus 4.5 is currently helping me write a novel, comprehensive and highly performant programming language with all of the things I've ever wanted, done in exactly my opinionated way.This project would have taken me years of specialization and research to do right. Opus's strength has been the ability to both speak broadly and also drill down into low-level implementations.I can express an intent, and have some discussion back and forth around various possible designs and implementations to achieve my goals, and then I can be preparing for other tasks while Opus works in the background. I ask Opus to loop me in any time there are decisions to be made, and I ask it to clearly explain things to me.Contrary to losing skills, I feel that I have rapidly gained a lot of knowledge about low-level systems programming. It feels like pair programming with an agentic model has finally become viable.I will be clear though, it takes the steady hand of an experience and attentive senior developer + product designer to understand how to maintain constraints on the system that allow the codebase to grow in a way that is maintainable on the long-term. This is especially important, because the larger the codebase is, the harder it becomes for agentic models to reason holistically about large-scale changes or how new features should properly integrate into the system.If left to its own devices, Opus 4.5 will delete things, change specification, shirk responsibilities in lieu of hacky band-aids, etc. You need to know the stack well so that you can assist with debugging and reasoning about code quality and organization. It is not a panacea. But it's ground-breaking. This is going to be my most productive year in my life.On the flip side though, things are going to change extremely fast once large-scale, profitable infrastructure becomes easily replicable, and spinning up a targeted phishing campaign takes five seconds and a walk around the park. And our workforce will probably start shrinking permanently over the next few years if progress does not hit a wall.Among other things, I do predict we will see a resurgence of smol web communities now that independent web development is becoming much more accessible again, closer to how it when I first got into it back in the early 2000's.",

I've used it a lot, for really complex code.And my conclusion is: it's still not as smart as a good human programmer. It frequently got stuck, went down wrong paths, ignored what I told it to do to do something wrong, or even repeat a previous mistake I had to correct.Yet in other ways, it's unbelievably good. I can give it a directory full of code to analyze, and it can tell me it's an implementation of Kozo Sugiyama's dagre graph layout algorithm, and immediately identify the file with the error. That's unbelievably impressive. Unfortunately it can't fix the error. The error was one of the many errors it made during previous sessions.So my verdict is that it's great for code analysis, and it's fantastic for injecting some book knowledge on complex topics into your programming, but it can't tackle those complex problems by itself.Yesterday and today I was upgrading a bunch of unit tests because of a dependency upgrade, and while it was occasionally very helpful, it also regularly got stuck. I got a lot more done than usual in the same time, but I do wonder if it wasn't too much. Wasn't there an easier way to do this?

But day to day, when I ask it \"build me this feature\" it uses strange abstractions, and often requires several attempts on my part to do it in the way I consider \"right\".

You can just build something that's tailed specifically to the problem you're trying to solve without worrying about edge cases.Which is to say, you're absolutely right :).",

Anything that resembles boilerplate is great. It does well refactoring unit tests, wrapping known code in a CLI, and does decent work with backend RESTful APIs. Where it fails utterly is things like HTML/CSS layout, JavaScript frontend code for SPAs, and particularly real world UI stuff that requires seeing and interacting with a web page/app where things like network latency and errors, browser UI, etc. can trip it up. Basically when the input and output are structured and known an LLM will do well. When they are “look and feel” they fail and fail until they make the code unmaintainable.This experience for me is current but I do not normally use Opus so perhaps I should give it a try and figure out if it can reason around problems I myself do not foresee (for example a browser JS API quirk that I had never seen).",

In a two-week blur I brought forth the bulk of a Ruby library that includes bindings to the Ratatui rust crate for making TUIs in Ruby. During that time I also brought forth documentation, example applications, build and devops tooling, and significant architectural decisions & roadmaps for the future. It's pretty unbelievable, but it's all there in the git and CI history. https://sr.ht/~kerrick/ratatui_ruby/I think the following things are true now:- Vibe Coding is, more than ever, \"autopilot\" in the aviation sense, not the colloquial sense. You have to watch it, you are responsible, the human has do run takeoff/landing (the hard parts), but it significantly eases and reduces risk on a bulk of the work.- The gulf of developer experience between today's frontier tooling and six months ago is huge. I pushed hard to understand and use these tools throughout last year, and spent months discouraged--back to manual coding. Folks need to re-evaluate by trying premium tools, not free ones.- Tooling makers have figured out a lot of neat hacks to work around the limitations of LLMs to make it seem like they're even better than they are. Junie integrates with your IDE, Antigravity has multiple agents maintaining background intel on your project and priorities across chats. Antigravity also compresses contexts and starts new ones without you realizing it, calls to sub-agents to avoid context pollution, and other tricks to auto-manage context.- Unix tools (sed, grep, awk, etc.) and the git CLI (ls-tree, show, --stat, etc.) have been a huge force-multiplier, as they keep the context small compared to raw ingestion of an entire file, allowing the LLMs to get more work done in a smaller context window.- The people who hire programmers are still not capable of Vibe Coding production-quality web apps, even with all these improvements. In fact, I believe today this is less of a risk than I feared 10 months ago. These are advanced tools that need constant steering, and a good eye for architecture, design, developer experience, test quality, etc. is the difference between my vibe coded Ruby [0] (which I heavily stewarded) and my vibe coded Rust [1] (I don't even know what borrow means).[0]: https://git.sr.ht/~kerrick/ratatui_ruby/tree/stable/item/lib[1]: https://git.sr.ht/~kerrick/ratatui_ruby/tree/stable/item/ext...",

The problem comes because even in agentic mode, these models do not (and I would argue, can not) understand code or how it works, they just see patterns and generate a plausible sounding explanation or solution. agentic mode means they can try/fail/try/fail/try/fail until something works, but without understanding the code, especially of a large, complex, long-lived codebase, they can unwittingly break something without realising - just like an intern or newbie on the project, which is the most common analogy for LLMs, with good reason.",

Disproportionately poor people live in food deserts and have to rely on dollar stores and other things where fruit and vegetables are expensive.Also, if you are busy single person, basically anything not shelf stable is expensive because you have to buy it in high quantities and it will go to waste if you are not skilled at storage. I, a mature adult, know how to store things, but as a younger person things went to rot a lot from inexperience.Then there is prep. I spent literally all day on sunday just preparing food for the week. It's about 10-12 hours. That's what 2 hours a day to cook during the week. I have lied to myself and said, \"oh, I'll cook something\" and then eaten out all day from being busy or being exhausted. To save money stuff I could jam into the microwave was cheaper.This is how you get there. I cook from fresh vegetables all the time now, but I have the time and energy for it. That just wasn't true at all when I was younger.",

McDonald's is probably the cheapest way to buy a hot meal containing beef (and it used to be even cheaper, you could add fries+coke for just 50c in the past).

The recommendations are higher than ever, yet people are constantly told not to think about protein, or to worry about excess protein intake instead.Case in point: the Mayo Clinic article titled \"Are you getting enough protein?\"[0]It claims that protein is only a concern for people who are undereating or on weight loss drugs, yet it cites protein recommendations that many people find challenging to meet (1.1g/kg for active people, more if you're over 40 or doing strength or endurance workouts.) To top it off, it's illustrated with a handful of nuts, which are pretty marginal sources of protein. It's bizarrely mixed messaging.[0] https://www.mayoclinichealthsystem.org/hometown-health/speak...",

Seems partisan spite cuts both ways.I'm glad to see this announcement and despite the leadership in Washington right now I don't think these adjustment will be seen as too controversial by the American public. The recommendations are based on a lot of good nutritional science that's been out there for years, but the buck seems to stop at the conversation around fat.They went to great lengths to remove the debate around good fat vs bad fat from this discussion. Even reading the report, emphasis is put on the discussion of why we use so many pressed oils in the food chain, but not why we phased lard and shortening out of the American diet.\"Eat real butter\" is ostensibly a recommendation presented at the bottom of the webpage, but butter is not a healthy fat. Same with some people's obsession with frying in beef tallow, but the report doesn't want to dig into this distinction for obvious self interested reasons. They even recommend:> When cooking with or adding fats to meals, prioritize oils with essential fatty\nacids, such as olive oil. Other options can include butter or beef tallow.Which is a good recommendation. But no, you don't want to replace olive oil with butter or beef tallow. There's a lot of good nutrition science to back this up, but the report would prefer to not go there. Maybe \"eat some butter\" is appropriate, but unless the FDA wants to have an honest conversation around HDL and LDL cholesterol and saturated fats, I don't see this inverted pyramid doing too much good for overall population health (besides raising awareness)",

Your home is evaluated at some \"market rate\", but if it's your primary residence the effective tax value is just 25% up to $1 million (70% on value above $1 million). For reference, a typical 3-room apartment in Oslo, the capital, is around $400-500k.However, if it's not your primary residence, then you pay tax on 100% of the \"market rate\". The tax rate is 1%, so not insignificant.Until a few years ago, tax on non-primary residences was much lower, and hence we had a lot more people buying to rent if they inherited money or similar. Some even had a dozen or more properties. These have now exited, so policy is working as intended.One thing of course politicians for some reason didn't think of is that if most of the landlords suddenly sell, rental market will shrink. So now it's super-expensive to rent, and those  who rent usually do so because they can't buy for one reason or another (no stable income to support a loan for example).",

For example:* American apartment complexes are typically ugly as hell. They're little building islands in a sea of asphalt, disconnected from the wider street grid too. They'd be more attractive if they were more like the complexes I saw while living in Munich: more green up front, car parking basically all underground.* Require substantial backyards/courtyards for said complexes.* More tenant protections that prevent landlords from arbitrarily non-renewing a lease, so that people in apartments can have long-term stability. If you break the rules repeatedly or severely, then sure, landlords should be able to remove you, but otherwise you should be left alone to live your life.While in Munich, we lived in the Solln neighborhood. It's mostly apartments of some kind (we lived in an apartment, and then a backyard duplex), but they just look a lot less ugly than they typically do in the US.

Then shadcn came along and all the Tailwind Plus alternatives (many times recreating the same UI elements that plus has) and then people just copied and used those components and polished further using AI.Before Tailwind got big, Adam released an amazing book about UI/UX called Refactoring UI[0] and it really helped me become better and understand subtleties of design. I even considered printing a personal physical book for my coffee table. If you want to support Adam and don't need Tailwind Plus, this ebook could be a good way.[0]. https://www.refactoringui.com/",

So, while vibe coding will also lead to bloat, it's easier to work with, and arguably higher value than paying for a specific framework.It's a tragedy in life that things that are useful don't always get valued, instead being used as a stepping stone for progress, but I'm not sure that has a solution.",

That said I felt that anything that obscures the raw CSS makes it much harder to deliver UI that works right, as it peppers hidden side effects across your code.That's why I wasn't too keen on CSS frameworks like Tailwind - I found that when writing frontend code the writing part takes up the minority of the time, it's producing a well thought out layout flow is what is actually the biggest sink of time and effort.That said, I'm not a frontend dev, and I'm to too good at CSS - but not horrible either - so I defer to the judgement of others who are pros at this, its just my opinion and experience.",

I can't verify this but there seems to be a correlation between companies who use hip new CSS and JS frameworks, and their AI usage, thus accelerating Tailwind Corp's cannibalization by AI, as most vibe coders are building web apps from what I've seen and Tailwind and React are very well represented in the training set.",

The big providers stock on hardware, front-run the hardware market, starve it for products while causing the prices to rise sharply and at that point their services are cheaper because they are selling you the hardware they bought at low prices, the one they bought in bulk, under cheap long term contracts and, in many cases, kept dark for some time.Result - at the time of high hardware prices in retail, the cloud prices are lower, the latter increase later to make more profits, and the game can continue with the cloud providers always one step ahead of retail in a game of hoarding and scalping.Most recently, scalping was big during the GPU shortages caused by crypto-mining. Scalpers would buy GPUs in bulk then sell them back to the starved market for a hefty margin.Cloud providers buying up hardware at scale is basically the same, the only difference is they sell you back the services provided by the hardware, not the actual gear.",

And the research was out there! Does everybody only read this single Harvard literature review? Does nobody read journals, or other meta studies, or anything? Did the researchers from other institutions whose research was criticized not make any fuss?I guess the thing that I most don't get is it's now been 10 years since then, and I haven't seen any news about the link between sugar and CVD.> There is now a considerable body of evidence linking added sugars to hypertension and cardiovascular diseaseOkay, where is it?

They don’t want you to apply the same level of rigor and introspection to the opposite side, though.In the sugar versus saturated fat debate, this incident is used as the lure to get people to blame sugar as the root cause. There is a push to make saturated fat viewed as not only neutral, but healthy and good for you. Yet if you apply the same standards of rigor and inspection of the evidence, excess sugar and excess saturated fat are both not good for you.There is another fallacy in play where people pushing these debates want you to think that there is only one single cause of CVD or health issues: Either sugar, carbs, fat, or something else.

          "content": "It's really good to ask these questions.I'm not a medial researcher, but my impression is that many fields find it difficult to produce the robust high-level risk comparisons that you ask about. I.e. if you're looking at blood fats, even there you'll find many complicated contextual factors (age, sex, ethnicity, type of lipids i.e. LDL or lp(a) or ...?). The same might be the case for sugar. So it's not really easy/cheap to combine detailed state-of-the-art measurements of different causes into one randomized controlled trial.As for the effects of sugar, I think there's some evidence that's not too hard to find, e.g. some meta analyses showing something around 10% increase in dose-dependent risk (RR ~ 1.10) [1,2]. A lot of the literature seems to be focused on beverages, e.g. this comparative cross-national study [3].[1] https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamainternalmedicine/fullar...[2] https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S08999...[3] https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-024-03345-4",

So you introduce the second food group: fruits and vegetables. A bit more expensive and more involved than grain, but it provides most of the things grain don't.Now, we are at a vegan diet, and experience has shown that it can be perfectly healthy, but in order for it to be, you need to do a significant amount of bookkeeping, and you may need some slightly exotic food to avoid deficiencies. So, not enough for the general population, so you introduce animal products.

Technically you do hedge the claim with \"excess\", which is effectively a tautology, so the claim isn't outright false. You also don't qualify whether you mean excess in absolute terms (i.e. caloric intake) or as a proportion of macronutrients.In practical terms, I don't consider it useful guidance based on the available evidence. As far as I can tell, there's little to no evidence that saturated fat is unhealthy (but lots of bad studies that don't prove what they claim to prove).

Some of the court documents against infowars placed the price for that sort of airtime at something like $20,000.The problem comes in that the actual experts have very little want or desire to do the same.  We're lucky if we see a few \"science communicators\" that step up to the plate, but they very rarely end up with the funds to sell the truth.This a big part of how the \"vaccines cause autism\" garbage spread.

The reasons were simple: some family health issues required downtime (though probably not as much as I ended up taking), and I could afford to do this in India in a way I couldn’t in the US. This happened to coincide with the market bottom, but I wasn’t laid off—it was entirely voluntary.I didn’t experience an identity crisis for a single day. I didn’t feel insecure or anxious about not working. The only real friction came from my family.One big difference was social life. In India, I was constantly meeting people—connections were easy and organic. In the US, maintaining a daytime social life felt much harder. Everyone is on a treadmill—insurance, income, careers—often not by choice. I know there are ways to build community here, but in India it just happened naturally.My extended family struggled more than I did. Once it became clear the break wasn’t temporary, there was a kind of quiet depression around it. I initially framed it as “taking a breather” by doing an executive MBA, but the break never really ended.What eventually brought me back wasn’t overt pressure, but practical limits: my spouse’s mental health, and the constraints of India’s education system for our partially disabled, special-ed child. Those realities mattered more than any career concern.",

If you control point C, even for a few hours, you can theoretically collect vast amounts of intelligence that would be very useful for government entities. The CANTV AS8048 being prepended to the AS path 10 times means there the traffic would not prioritize this route through AS8048, perhaps that was the goal?AS prepending is a relatively common method of traffic engineering to reduce traffic from a peer/provider. Looking at CANTV's (AS8048) announcements from outside that period shows they do this a lot.Since this was detected as a BGP route leak, it looks like CANTV (AS8048) propagated routes from Telecom Italia Sparkle (AS6762) to GlobeNet Cabos Sumarinos Columbia (AS52320). This could have simply been a misconfiguration.Nothing nefarious immediately jumps out to me here. I don't see any obvious attempts to hijack routes to Dayco Telecom (AS21980), which was the actual destination. The prepending would have made traffic less likely to transit over CANTV assuming there was any other route available.The prepending done by CANTV does make it slightly easier to hijack traffic destined to it (though not really to Dayco), but that just appears to be something they just normally do.This could be CANTV trying to force some users of GlobeNet to transit over them to Dayco I suppose, but leaving the prepending in would be an odd way of going about it. I suppose if you absolutely knew you were the shortest path length, there's no reason to remove the prepending, but a misconfiguration is usually the cause of these things.",

Maybe this is possible with WLAN too, but I have never tried.Also, you don't need a Tailscale or other VPN account. You can just use SSH + tunneling, or enable a VPN on your router (and usually enjoy hardware acceleration too!).

It's purpose is for: internet, using Microsoft products when I'm forced to, Zoom/meetings, and SSH (or Mosh).Most of my work is not done on this Macbook, instead I use it mostly as a terminal. I have a desktop that's sitting behind my TV so that it can be my TV and gaming system (yeah I know Monitor > TV. I'm a filthy casual and I don't care). I have a mouse connected to that computer and instead of using a keyboard I use ydotool (Wayland xdotool) with a shortcut on my iPhone or a script on my android phone or from my Macbook. I don't have to get up from the couch and I don't need a clunky wireless keyboard to clutter my livingroom.Additionally I have a few pis and an old android phone with Tailscale installed on them. That's come in handy before as a machine's been disconnected and so I couldn't ssh from outside. Also makes it really easy to do a jump if you want to keep a machine off Tailscale or you don't have full control (like my 3D printer).This setup is very natural feeling if you live in the terminal. I actually started doing this when I started doing HPC work. In a setting like that you're never sitting in front of the computer you're doing most of your work on so it kinda clicked \"why was I restricting myself outside work?\" Plus there's the side benefits of I always have access to my media, tools, and other stuff. You can do exactly the same thing with a phone but I like having a keyboard and the air is very lightweight and has a long battery life. Any netbook would have done the job tbh.[0] There's a reason they're called \"terminal emulators\" rather than just \"terminals\".",

That was  was actually quite successful, producing a little utility that I use to this day, completely without looking at the code. (Well, I did briefly glance at it after completion and it made my eyeballs melt.) I concluded the value of this to me personally was nowhere near the price I was charged so I didn't continue using it, but I was impressed nonetheless.This brief use of Claude Code was done mostly on a train using my mobile phone's wi-fi hotspot. Since the connection would be lost whenever the train went through a tunnel, I encountered a bug in Claude Code [1]. The result of it was that whenever the connection dropped and came up again I had to edit an internal json file it used to track the state of its tool use, which had become corrupt.The issue had been open for months then, and still is. The discussion under it is truly remarkable, and includes this comment from the devs:> While we are always monitoring instances of this error and and looking to fix them, it's unlikely we will ever completely eliminate it due to how tricky concurrency problems are in general.Claude Code is, in principle, a simple command-line utility. I am confident that (given the backend and model, ofc) I could implement the functionality of it that I used in (generously!) at most a few thousand lines of python or javascript, I am very confident that I could do so without introducing concurrency bugs and I am extremely confident that I could do it without messing up the design so badly that concurrency issues crop up continually and I have to admit to being powerless to fix them all.Programming is hard, concurrency problems are tricky and I don't like to cast aspersions on other developers, but we're being told this is the future of programming and we'd better get on board or be left behind and it looks like we're being told this by people who, with presumably unlimited access to all this wonderful tooling, don't appear to be able to write decent software.[1] https://github.com/anthropics/claude-code/issues/6836",

I can only imagine that no one at Anthropic uses VSCode because it really seems insane it's gone this long unfixed.",

The skills almost all invoke a Python script that guides the agents through workflows.It's not a fast workflow: it frequently takes more than 1 hour just for the planning phase. Execution is significantly faster, as (typically) most issues have been discovered during the planning phase already (otherwise it would be considered a bug and I'd improve the workflow based on that).I'm under the impression that the creator of Claude Code's post is also intended to raise awareness of certain features of Claude Code, such as hand-offs to the cloud and back. Their workflow only works for small features. It reads a bit like someone took a “best practices” guide and turned it into a twitter post.

It was an extraction/capture operation. It was a large scale one, but they left after they captured Maduro and his Wife.> I think you can argue that the Bin Laden raid was and invasion into Pakistan.

          "content": "The main thing about prolog isn't the algorithms. In fact, the actual depth-first search isn't even part of the standard.The nice thing about prolog is that you write logical rules, and they can get used in whatever order and direction that is needed. By direction, I mean that if you define \"a grandparent is the parent of a parent\", you can now use that rule not just to evaluate whether one person is a parent (or to find all grandparents) but also to conclude that if you know someone is a grandparent, and they are the parent of some one, then that person is someone's parent. Ok, it can also do recursion, so if you define an ancestor as a parent or the parent of an ancestor it will recurse all the way up the family tree. Neat.You could write some kind of runtime that takes c code and brute-forces its way from outputs to inputs, except that regular imperative code allows for all kinds of things that make this impossible (e.g. side-effects). So then, you'd be limited to some subset, essentially ending up with a domain specific language again, albeit with the same syntax as your regular code, rather than those silly :- symbols (although LISP looks much sillier than prolog IMHO).What the article is getting at is that if you use some features specific to a language, it's hard to embed your code as a library in another language. But is it? I mean, DLLs don't need to be written in the same language, there's stuff like JNI, and famously there's stuff like pytorch and tensorflow that runs CUDA code from python.",

One, as the author argues, is to write a library in an existing language, which may require sacrificing ergonomics to fit inside the syntax of the host language, but is safe, modular and reusable.Many DSLs can be bolted onto an existing language with support for compiler extensions. This approach offers more flexibility, but often leads to fragmentation and poor interoperability in the language ecosystem.There is third approach, established by a group in Minnesota [1], which is to design languages and tools which are modular and extensible from the get-go, so that extensions are more interoperable. They do research on how to make this work using attribute grammars.If the host language has a sufficiently expressive type system, you can often get away with writing a fluent API [2] or type safe embedded DSL. But designing languages and type systems with good support for meta-programming is also an active area of research. [3, 4]If none of these options work, the last resort is to start from tabula rasa and write your own parser, compiler, and developer tools. This offers the most flexibility, but requires an enormous amount of engineering, and generally is not recommended in 2026.[1]: https://melt.cs.umn.edu[2]: https://arxiv.org/pdf/2211.01473[3]: https://www.cs.tsukuba.ac.jp/~kam/papers/aplas2016.pdf[4]: https://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.17065",

It's also risky to adopt a language that you cannot easily hire developers for, for example.Libraries are great, but there is only so much they can address, and that depends on the language, too, as the article correctly points out. And there are two kinds of libries: tool libraries and frameworks. Someone once said it nicely: \"Frameworks are like Hollywood - 'You don't call us, we call you!'\".

While theory looks at languages via its semantics, in practice as the OP notes it is about the quality of the implementation and what can be reasonably done with the language.A recent [1] case is Julia. I think it has hit a kind of sweet spot for language design where new performant code tends to get written in Julia rather than in some other language and bound to it. At its core, it is a simple \"call functions, passing data in and getting results out\" kind of language, but what the functions (\"methods\") mean and how the compiler does just-ahead-of-time compilation with deep type specialized code means you can write high level code that optimizes very well. Those mechanics operate under the hood though, which makes for a pleasant programming experience ... and there are loads of cutting edge packages being written in Julia. It is less interesting to look at Julia as \"just the language\".[1] recent in programming languages is perhaps anything <= 15 years? .. because it takes time to discover a language's potential.",

Yes you can express that awkwardly with tons of type annotations and DSL conventions so that you never have to leave your favourite programming language. But then there's the problem of a Prolog \"engine\" doing quite a bit more than what could be reasonably assumed behind a synchronous library call, such as working with a compact solution space representation and/or value factoring, parallel execution environment, automatic value pruning and propagation, etc.The integration of a Prolog backend into a mainstream stack is typically achieved via Prolog code generation (and also code generation via LLMs) or as a \"service\" on the Prolog side, considering Prolog also has excellent support for parsing DSLs or request/responses of any type; as in, you can implement a JSON parser in a single line of code actually.As they say, if Prolog fits your application, it fits really well, like with planning, constraint solving, theorem proving, verification/combinatoric test case enumeration, pricing models, legal/strategic case differentiation, complex configuration and the like, the latter merely leveraging the modularity of logic clauses in composing complex programs using independent units.So I don't know how much you've worked hands on with Prolog, but I think you actually managed to pick about one of the worst rather than best examples ;)",

It was a really fancy place, state of art, loads of diagnostic equipment and a limited on-site lab, almost a hospital. But pretty soon I realized I was almost always seeing Nurse Practitioners, or Doctors so fresh out of medical school they were still wet behind the ears.Even worse, they were almost always wrong about the diagnosis and I'd find myself on 3 or 4 rounds of antibiotics, or would go to the pharmacy to pick up something and they'd let me know the cocktail I had just been prescribed had dangerous counterindications. I finally stopped going when I caught a doctor searching webmd when I was on my fourth return visit for a simple sinus infection that had turned into a terrible ear infection.My next doctor wasn't much better. And I had really started to lose trust in the medical system and in medical training.We moved a few years ago to a different city, and I hadn't found a doctor yet. One day I took sick with something, went to a local walk-in clinic in a strip mall used mostly by the local underprivileged immigrant community.Luck would have it I now found an amazing doctor who's been 100% correct in every diagnosis and line of care for both me and my wife since - including some difficult and sometimes hard to diagnose issues. She has basically no equipment except a scale, a light, a sphygmomanometer, and a stethoscope. Does all of her work using old fashioned techniques like listening to breathing or palpation and will refer to the local imaging center or send out to the local lab nearby if something deeper is needed.The difference in absolutely wild. I sometimes wonder if she and my old doctors are even in the same profession.I guess what I'm trying to say is, if you don't like your doctor, try some other ones until you find a good one, because they can be a world difference in quality -- and don't be moved by the shine of the office.",

She's doing great now (at least with that one thing).That's not to say that it's better than doctors or even that it's a good way to address every condition.

For some people this will be  valuable and potentially dramatically help them, and for others it might serve to send them further down roads of misinformation / conspiracies.I guess I ultimately think this is a good thing because people capable of informing themselves will be able to do so more effectively and, sadly, the other folks are (realistically) probably a lost cause but at the very least we need to do better educating our children in critical thinking and being ok with being wrong.",

The interest doesn't exist yet.Interest gets recognised as it accrues over time. Each month (or whatever period), you debit interest expense and credit accrued interest payable. The liability grows as time passes.Recording future interest upfront would violate the matching principle - you can't recognise an expense for something that hasn't happened yet. If you pay off the loan early, you don't owe that interest.That said, I think the article's bigger point about how money flows still holds. The technical accounting is just one layer of how this stuff actually gets recorded.",

          "content": "The critique of the financial system relies on a misunderstanding of the Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) model.You conflate 'r' (the discount rate) with 'Rf' (the risk-free interest rate). In reality, for high-risk assets like startups, 'r' is defined by the Weighted Average Cost of Capital (WACC) or CAPM: r = Rf + Beta(Rm - Rf).Even in a ZIRP environment where Rf -> 0, the Beta (risk/volatility) for a startup is massive. A rational investor would still demand a high 'r', leading to a low valuation. The fact that VCs ignored this and funded \"blatantly bad deals\" cannot be explained by low interest rates alone. It is better explained by the information asymmetry a.k.a principal-agent problem.We have a system where capital flows from passive LPs through multiple layers of rent-seeking intermediaries (VCs, LPs, Fund Managers) who are incentivized by management fees rather than carry. The market failure described isn't \"financial nihilism\" and \"financial short-termism\". It's a breakdown of feedback loops where intermediaries face no downside risk for misallocation. When there is no market coordination, no real competition, just unrestricted collusion, then things start to not make sense from the old school financial/business perspective. I do not think this is the failure of economic theory or the financial models itself, rather just that nobody knows or tells, that the prerequisite for these things is at least some degree of fair competition, market based economy, informed, rational actors and restricted collusion.Suggesting that technical founders can fix this by simply \"being decent\" ignores the systemic reality. This economic structure rewards extraction over value creation, \"decency\" is an evolutionary disadvantage. The \"real hackers\" in this story are the financial and business intermediaries who successfully reverse-engineered the economy to extract rent without generating value, similarly to all those entrepreneurs, CEOs, corpo drones in the business sphere who do not provide any meaningful value to society (and shareholders as well.)",

I am now in debt and they are in credit - to balance, both are 100.However, they require a return on investment - usury: 10 for 100 (or a 10% margin - call it what you like).When I take out my loan, I am in debt for 110 and they are in credit for 100 with a promise of 10 later.  So we have some accounts - my one account is 110 in debit (I borrowed 100 and promised to pay 10 on top) and they have two accounts - one for the principal (100) and another for the 10 interest.  To me, in this case, the principal and interest are part of the same account but to the lender they are separated out because the interest is probably taxable as income.However, it might be the case that I can set off my debt or the interest on my debt against some tax.  In that case I will maintain two accounts - the principal and the interest.All those interests will also end up in additional accounts related to probably banking.I've probably pissed off a few accountants with my choice of terms but in the end I do understand how fiat money works.What gets on my tits is assertions such as \"People who don't understand ...\" with no working.",

The same goes for some other loans like mortgages which often come with an agreement that you won't pay it back within a number of years (unless you pay a fee). If you intend to pay back the interest normally then you could totally book it as a liability up front, it's the same thing at the end of the day. I mean, it is literally a liability. You've agreed to pay back the amount of the loan plus interest.I'd encourage people doing their own accounts to think of it like this and don't do things that professional accountants do \"just because\".The thing is accounting is all made up. We try to squeeze this idea of \"value\" into this abstraction called \"money\" and make it all work. But it's trivial to find cases where it's overly simplified and doesn't really work.For example, how do you book depreciation of a motor vehicle? For the average person with a single utility vehicle the vehicle's value remains roughly the same from the moment of purchase until the moment is is written off. The value is its utility to you. In my accounts, I book this simply as \"1 car\" in my assets. But accountants don't like that. Everything has to be valued in money. So you end up with stupid stuff like averaging the depreciation over time that is pure fiction and only exists to make the books work and reduce the \"shock\" when a vehicle is finally written off.",

Banks pay interest on deposits, absorb defaults, cover operating costs, hold capital, and meet liquidity rules.

It means deposits are not 100% cash backed (because they have loaned out a portion of your deposit).This is a popular myth, not “doing the math”.What you’re describing only works in an absurd edge case where people borrow money just to park it and pay interest without spending it.

Playing video games and watching TV is fun.Valuable is it makes money. Importantly, it's what other people are willing to pay you money for, not what you think is important or even good.Meaningful is it's spiritually enriching. These are things you would regret not doing on your deathbed. Spending time with your family or going to church are common examples of things that are meaningful to people (and potentially fun). This one is defined based on one's internal compass and varies significantly from person to person.You can come up with activities that are pure fun, value, or meaning. Measuring activities against these three axes has been a valuable mental model for my time management and life design.There's jobs that are fun and meaningful, but don't pay much. This is like charity work or passion tax industries such as game dev, music, or art.There's also jobs that are fun and valuable, but are meaningless. Working at a trading firm/hedge fund is a common example (though some people may find that it's all three or only one). Another example is being a successful startup founder working on the wrong problem.Finally, there are jobs that are valuable and meaningful, but maybe not all that fun. To me, this is what being a startup founder (working on the right problems) or how I imagine a professional athlete is like.The grand slam would be having all three, but in my experience these are exceptionally rare. If it's fun and meaningful, everyone wants to do it, and supply and demand pushes the value down. Most of these cases are due to unusual personalities that let one find fun or meaning in activities others don't. This ties into the common startup advice of paying attention to \"founder-problem fit\" and \"what are your unfair advantages\".",

          "content": "CPA here again, You're poking and some very interesting concepts! There is a lot to explore. Some thoughts:- Yes money is in many ways best thought of as an abstraction. A socially agreed upon store of value that is easily exchangeable for other things of value. There is a tension (and a spectrum) between commodities that have use value and money commodities that have exchange value. In nascent market economies, commodities with use value can emerge as money commodities through consensus, that is, they emerge as socially agreed upon exchange value commodities. Think cigarettes in prison or precious metals like gold. Money commodities emerge naturally once there is enough stable volume of market activity which ensures liquidity. It's all contingent on constant market activity to keep it liquid as well as a sustained social consensus that is represents a store of exchange value. This is a lot of what Marx's Das Capital explores.- Things like vehicle depreciation are not just so the books \"work\" nor is the intent for it to perfectly represent how an asset depreciates. Consider a milk delivery business. I buy a delivery vehicle year 1 for $40,000 and I expect it to last me 10 years approximately. Let's say I earn $10,000 a year for the delivery business and I pay a driver $7,000 a year to deliver milk using my delivery vehicle. If i don't include depreciation of the delivery vehicle my net income is $3,000 annually or 30%. Pretty darn good! However, we know the vehicle asset was used in service of earning all that revenue, so we should include something to ensure all revenues are netted against all known expenses whether they are wages or capital assets deployed in service of earning said revenues. Otherwise we have an incomplete picture of the business performance in our annual income statement. If I include $4,000 of annual depreciation on the vehicle suddenly I am no longer profitable to the tune of $1,000 a year. This is the matching principle. Profitability needs to ensure all revenues netted against all expenses associated with earning those revenues regardless of cash flow timing.- But your point stands... The specific amount of depreciation annually is made up mostly, maybe the asset depreciates slower or faster. But there is enormous value in a rule consistently applied. Let's say you're an expert in delivery trucks and you know that the asset will last 20 years not 10... You could purchase the business at a cheap valuation because on paper it loses money annually, but you know the depreciation should only really be 2,000 and therefore the business is actually profitable all other things being equal. You leverage a widely recognized and understood standard applied very consistently as being imperfect, and you use that as a stepping stone to back into what you believe is the true value. This is where things like EBITDA come from that start with GAAP measures and back into what are believed to be better representations of business value, but it hinges on widely understood accounting standards being applied very consistently to create financial information that can be modified for other uses.",

          "content": "You are mixing up a lot of different ideas and concepts.Historically, the combination of fractional reserve banking and the classic gold standard was very successful.  Just because your bank uses grams of gold as the unit of accounting (or something that's effectively equivalent to grams of gold), doesn't mean they need to have that much of gold in their vaults.  Similar to how today a bank will give you dollar bills when you ask for them, but that doesn't mean they need to have their vaults stuffed full of dollar bills.  They just need enough solid assets to sell for dollars, so they can give you dollars when you want to withdraw.  (Having some gold or dollars on hand is just a convenience, so you don't have to wait for the bank to liquidate assets.)About narrow banking: there's at least two different definitions of the idea.  What your website describes might be called 100% reserve banking.  The website is a bit silly: you can already get 100% reserve banking today, if you want it.The website is also extremely misleading and dishonest about fractional reserve banking.  You can eg just follow their own link to the Bank of Amsterdam and read up on it.The second definition of 'narrow banking' can be seen at eg https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Narrow_banking> Narrow banking is a proposed banking system that would restrict commercial banks to hold only safe and liquid assets, like government bonds, against customer deposits, while prohibiting traditional lending activities. Under this model, banks would function as custodians and payment processors, separate from the lending function performed by other financial intermediaries.This is like a normal fractional reserve bank, but the only asset they invest in is government bonds.  This can still go wrong, if you are not careful: Silicon Valley Bank invested mainly in government bonds, but had a maturity mismatch.  Their long term government bonds lost in value (because market interest rates went up), so they went bankrupt.  Alas, they still got bailed out.You can approximate this kind of narrow bank for yourself, by just putting your money either in government bonds directly, or into a money market fund that only invests in government bonds.> [...] I feel like debating that even America itself would benefit from if less foreign nations held US treasury bonds.In what sense would America benefit?  On an inflation adjusted basis, foreigners often get a negative real interest payment, ie they lose money, for the privilege of lending to the US.  That seems like an extremely good deal for America.> There already are some gold pegged stablecoins and theoretically with things like revolut or some instant way to sell crypto without too much hassle/losses and transfering it easily, its rather possible to do such.Wise offers to keep your money in a fund and they transparently sell your fund shares, when you are buying a coffee with your card.  They transparently buy fund shares, when money comes into your account.See https://wise.com/help/articles/3luodUQFD9YWzNc8PvIfVK/holdin... and https://wise.com/sg/interest/ and https://wise.com/help/articles/74dYRhMCItIf2IBJLTpFQs/how-do...---Addendum narrow banking in the sense of only holding government bonds:I think that should be legal for banks to do, and in fact it's a good argument in favour of eliminating deposit insurance.  At least the (explicitly or implicitly) government backed deposit insurance that you have eg in the US.  It creates a moral hazard where the incentives for monitoring risks are all but dulled.People who still want the equivalent of deposit insurance should just put their money into a bank that only invests in short term government bonds: after all, a government backed deposit insurance can't really be safer than these short term government bonds anyway.",

Have a hay bale / giant sugar cube in one corner fall off the back of a truck / helicopter :)  Horses start out dumb and move directly towards the goal before backtracking.  Smarter horses path find the shortest route to the goal.- Goals!  Now that the horse is moving, get the horse into a static horse box / cattle pen cell by strategically placing fences so that the path it takes towards the food involves walking onto the goal square.- Floods!  Water encroaches from the edges on a turn by turn basis.  Not only do you have to contain the horse, you also have to hold back the flood.",

This does obviously limit you to a single web server, but single machines can have tons of cores and serve tens of thousands of requests per second, so that is not as limiting as you'd think.2. Tools like litestream will continuously back up all writes to object storage, so that one web server having a hardware failure is not a problem as long as your SLA allow downtimes of a few minutes every few years. (and let's be real, most small companies for which this would be a good architecture don't have any SLA at all)3. SQLite has concurrent writes now, so it's gotten much more performant in situations with multiple users at the same time.So for specific use cases it can be a nice setup because you don't feel the downsides (yet) but you do get better latency and simpler architecture.

SQLite现在支持并发写入，因此在多用户同时访问的场景下性能大幅提升。因此，对于特定用例，这可能是一种不错的配置，因为你暂时感受不到其缺点，却能获得更低的延迟和更简单的架构。话虽如此，标准架构之所以成为标准是有原因的，所以除非有非常特殊的理由选择这种方案，我建议在99%的情况下还是采用“常规”的多层架构。"

It uses the relationship between size and mass.Because A0 is defined as having an area of exactly 1 square meter, the paper density (GSM or grams per square meter) maps directly to the weight of the sheet.>A0 = 1 meter square.>Standard office paper = 80 gsm>Therefore, one sheet of A0 = 80 grams.>Since A4 is 1/16th of an A0, a single sheet of standard A4 paper weighs 5 grams.I rarely need to use a scale for postage. If I have a standard envelope (~5g) and 3 sheets of paper (15g), I know I'm at 20g total. It turns physical shipping logistics into simple integer arithmetic. The elegance of the metric system is that it makes the properties of materials discoverable through their definitions.",

The started would turn as that was a simple relay, but all ECU controlled devices wouldn't trigger. Plugging into the ECU, no error codes and all looked normal.Eventually we tracked the issue to some corruption in the ROM that was only getting read in certain circumstances, since the ECU stores maps for engine parameters based on things like pressure and temperature you might only hit the corrupted bits of a table in very specific circumstances.Reflashed the ROM and all was good afterwards.

If MS can't manage release engineering to keep dev/test things alive, then it's not helpful to the belief they can do it for production things either.I inherited an IBM PC/RT back in the 90s. It was well outside what most people would consider its support lifetime. IBM could not have been more helpful working out how to keep it alive. I suspect this influences why when I later had some financial authority I was happier to buy thinkpad, than any other hardware we had available: I knew from experience they stood behind their maintenance guarantees. The device was configured to run BSD, not the IBM supported OS of the day, made no difference. It was end of life product line, made no difference.This was before Lenovo of course. But the point stands: people with positive support stories, keep that vendor in their top-set",

Besides the run of the mill \"corrupt files at random in System32\", which is common and simple enough to fix with a clean install, I've had a few cases where it appears an attempt at rolling back a BIOS update has been interrupted by the rollback manager and left those machines hard bricked. They could only be recovered by flashing a clean BIOS image with an external programmer and clip (or hand soldering leads), after which they ran without issue.As much as it's valid to question the unconditional anti-Microsoft mentality, they are still far from infallible and from my experience they are getting notably more unreliable in recent years.",

          "content": "Very impressive build! It's amazing what one can do thanks to CNC and FLPCB manufacturing services readily available to any motivated hacker.One tip for the author who noticed the camera being warm: measure its power consumption, and compare to an unmodified G9ii. Especially because you noticed it drains the battery relatively quickly(!) This is a glaring \"connect the dots\" situation to me. The root cause might be something very stupid. For example when you removed the microphone jack, the camera thought a microphone was connected, so it activated a microphone nenu. But given the extensive number of mods you made, it's possible you are making the firmware think some accessory is connected—could be anything: (light) flash, external screen, USB gadget, JTAG reader, SD card, etc. So it's taking a code path to initialize the device, but it fails because the device is not present, and it retries repeatedly, thus entering a retry loop that's causing excessive CPU usage... That wouldn't surprise me. You are running a G9ii that's unique therefore a rare software code path like this would not happen on a standard G9ii and would never have been fixed by the developers.Edit: I see the author measured power here: https://www.reddit.com/r/Lumix/comments/1oif3jp/how_much_doe... and to my eyes, these seem really high numbers. For example in video playback mode he measures 340mA, so 2.45W (battery is 7.2V nominal). The standard G9ii battery is 16Wh that means it would last only 6.5 hours playing back video. Compare this to a Pixel 9 phone: 18.3Wh battery and can playback video for 15 hours (I believe these are benchmark numbers reported playing back 4k H264 video, probably in a similar-ish format to the G9ii in terms of bitrate, etc). Plus the phone is at a disadvantage as it has a bigger, more power-hungry display. So it seems to me his G9ii consumes twice as much power as it should, if not more... If anything a pro camera should be more optimized than a general-purpose consumer device when playing video!",

Plus I can listen to podcasts while I model, but not while I write code - it engages the brain differently.Now that LLMs are sapping some of the joy out of programming (I use the tools, they're productive, achieving goals and delivering user value is still satisfying, etc. - but the act of writing code is just more enjoyable than prompting, so it's a tad dispiriting that it's getting harder to jusitify) I also find that I get a lot of satisfaction from doing something with my hands.

          "content": "Meh, I love my Olympus cameras, but I wouldn't call the latest models exactly small. The OM1 is pretty huge, even though it's smaller than the ridiculous Panasonic G9. I think it's close to the Sony a7 line and the canon r6, which are full-frame. Of course, if you're into long lenses, it wipes the floor with them, if the compromise works for you. On the wide end, the advantage isn't as clear-cut, though nobody else has anything comparable to the 8-25.What I'm hoping to see is a new penf. When it came out, they somehow managed to cram into that small body almost everything the em1 had at the time. The om3 is pretty small, too, but for some reason they decided to keep the faux-pentaprism bump. It would have been great if it had the viewfinder to the side.",

Most slr cameras have buttons on both sides of the lens, so developing muscle memory is easier when those actions are split between each hand. Rotation of the camera is also much more natural. It also centers the lens' pov between your eyes, matching their parallax, which is really important for composing the photograph outside of the viewfinder.",

None of those keypoints are reliable feature descriptors. They all are on foliage, which changes depending on season and wind. Geolocating that picture accurately _automatically_ using features is next to impossible.Now, they might have a vibe based matcher which does some basic spatial comparison, but I'm not sure how reliable they are, especially given a large search radius.The other interesting question is, where did they get their data from? I'm pretty sure google spent a lot of time making it really difficult to train from street view (lord knows we've tried.)Edit the demo here: https://geospy.ai/ is much more what I recognise a bog standard VPS system does.

Then when someone comes with that vehicle, they will strike a new Vin plate. Sometimes if they buy the VINs it will come in a package with plates.  From there it's possible to get the vehicle registered, most likely under someone else's name that has no idea and they will sell / rent the car with tag etc. Though sometimes they will just make a fake plate too and then steal a real plate, swap it with the fake plate and put the real plate on the stolen car and sell it like that.  In some cases / states they can actually get a title reissued.Boats are even better, but much smaller market, just look up coast guard plates on Amazon.Stiker vs Styker, is regional.For Reference: Striker Music https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaTxkD5JFpg",

Geolocating that picture accurately _automatically_ using features is next to impossible.Seems plausible enough to me. The trees are evergreens in a place that doesn't get snow, and the keypoints are mostly grounded on stable parts of the trees (trunks or thick branches), which barring gale-force winds probably don't fluctuate all that much.The part that gives me pause are the keypoints that map the hood of the car to the pavement, and the point on the far right that maps the ledge to the pavement.

The exception is when the system is ill-designed or ill-tuned, so it halts and I'm effectively debugging it for them, except nothing is fixed b/c the employee just logs in and waves it through.

It is just missing a critical tipping point. Basically, I want an alexa like device for the home backed by local inference and storage with some standardized components identified:- the interactive devices - all the alexa/google/apple devices out there are this interface, also, probably some TV input that stays local and I can voice control. That kind of thing. It should have a good speaker and voice control. It probably should also do other things like act as a wifi range extender or be the router. That would actually be good. I would buy one for each room so no need for crazy antennas if they are close and can create true mesh network for me. But I digress.- the home 'cloud' server that is storage and control. This is a cheap CPU, a little ram and potentially a lot of storage. It should hold the 'apps' for my home and be the one place I can back-up everything about my network (including the network config!)- the inference engines. That is where this kind of repo/device combo comes in. I buy it and it knows how to advertise in a standard way its services and the controlling node connects it to the home devices. It would be great to just plug it in and go.Of course all of these could be combined but conceptually I want to be able to swap and mix and match at these levels so options here and interoperability is what really matters.I know a lot of (all of) these pieces exist, but they don't work well together. There isn't a simple standard 'buy this turn it on and pair with your local network' kind of plug and play environment.My core requirements are really privacy and that it starts taking over the unitaskers/plays well together with other things. There is a reason I am buying all this local stuff. If you phone home/require me to set up an account with you I probably don't want to buy your product. I want to be able to say 'Freddy, set timer for 10 mins' or 'Freddy, what is the number one tourist attraction in South Dakota' (wall drugs if you were wondering)",

It was not just some quick show off thing. The model could interact and respond right away in real time. ~That got me thinking again about what practical even means when it comes to AI running on the edge. Like, away from big servers.I came up with a basic way to look at it. First, capability. That is, what kinds of tasks can it handle decently. Then latency. Does it respond quick enough so it does not feel laggy. There are also constraints to consider. Things like power use, how much memory it needs, and heat buildup.The use case part seems key too. What happens if you try to take it off the cloud and run it locally. In my experience, a lot of these edge AI demos fall short there. The tech looks impressive, but it is hard to see why you really need it that way.It seems like most people overlook that unclear need. I am curious about how others see it. Local inference probably beats cloud in spots where you cannot rely on internet, or maybe for privacy reasons. Or when data stays on device for security.Some workloads feel close right now. They might shift soon as hardware gets better. I think stuff like voice assistants or simple image recognition could tip over.If someone has actually put a model on limited hardware, like in a product, what stood out as a surprise. The thermals maybe, or unexpected power drains. It feels like that part gets messy in practice. I might be oversimplifying how tricky it all is.",

It's the thin-edge of mass, casual surveillance of the population.In other words, putting a tail on someone should be manpower intensive because that's a check on police power, they have to really want to track someone to invest potentially several officers' time to it full time, whereas sticking a bug on a car is something they can do to dozens of cars per day per officer.Of course now they don't even have to do that because our police state has normalized centralized cctv camera databases, license plate trackers that continuously track the movement of every vehicle in a city into a database. Now they're doing the same with facial recognition.Now it's even a felony in Florida to do anything to block license plate trackers from tagging your vehicle (so you can't obscure your plate in a way that leaves it readable to humans but not to the automatic tracking software).

She feels extremely tired despite standard blood test markers being OK.The smell could have simple explanations, like she forgets to ventilate the room, or her hygiene is not as good as before, since she has become more avoidant of any discomfort, but we are helping her with the hygiene part at least, the ventilation is harder because she complains about cold, and refuses to leave the room. Also to me, it is a different smell from what would be poor ventilation and from what would be lack of hygiene, but I can’t point out what it is.  I'm usually very good detecting when a room has not been ventilated, I just feel I breath worse and can't focus as well, I'm annoying to other people that doesn't want to open the window.She spends most of the time in bed, her body is telling her to sleep much more than before, and she has become very stubborn about getting out of the house, going to the dentist, etc. Since she is very intelligent and still has the verbal ability to make you believe she will do it as soon as she feels better and that will be soon, the reality is that months are passing by and that is not happening.I wonder if anyone could recommend an affordable but effective air quality device, mold testing kits (if such a thing exists), or what targeted blood tests can be done. Also, if there are tests to fine grain the diagnosis of vascular dementia, to know if there is accumulation of proteins in the brain, or what is the origin of the issue.She is 79 years old, perhaps there is nothing to do, but somehow I feel the environment of the house has something toxic in it, I even thought about electromagnetic fields, but I really don’t know where to start.Edit: We live in Spain, her doctor feedback is that her blood tests are great for her age, and we didn't have much info about the vascular dementia situation somehow has been implied that is normal in her age.",

More than that, you likely have mold issues in the walls or ceiling or floors.

Human-like behavior is unlikely to emerge from language models in isolation; it appears to come from closed perception-reasoning loops that are causally coupled to the environment.

The challenge is that olfaction isn't like vision. you're not detecting photons at discrete wavelengths, you're dealing with ~400 olfactory receptor types responding to millions of possible volatile molecules in combinatorial ways.MOX sensors (like the SnO2 in this paper) have been around for decades but hit a fundamental ceiling—they require specific coatings to bind to specific VOCs. Want to detect a new substance? You're changing hardware.The more promising path, IMO, is carbon nanotube (CNT) sensors that actually mimic how our nose works. Instead of measuring bulk resistance changes, you functionalize CNT arrays to respond to specific molecular binding events—much closer to how olfactory receptors operate. detection of new substances becomes a software/ML problem rather than a hardware redesign. That's how biology does it—your nose doesn't grow new receptors, your brain learns new patterns.Full disclosure: I'm building in this space (https://nosy.network) Nosy is using CNT paired with transformer models to create what we call a \"Large Essence Model\" (LEM).

This is literally yoga and meditation practice and has been studied for at least a couple thousand years.Even if we exclude the modern invention of yoga as exercise in the 20th century, there are seated practices of releasing these tensions in the body. It's not even framed in mystical terms, it's literally just opening the body and getting rid of discomfort, pain, and stress in the body so that you can sit and focus for longer periods of time in your formal meditation practice.Even in the author's teacher's capital V Vipassana tradition, invented in the 20th century, it is known that the piti that arises even in the first stages of meditation can be directed. That weak piti is just the piloerection response, which is an autonomic response, and if you can control it it would seem to imply we of course have facility over things science assumes we have no control over.",

For about six months I was on a strict regimen of eating very little solid food,  instead I would throw random foods into a pot (like turnips,  seaweed,  beef,  crazy stuff) and cook them like soup then grind them up with an immersion blenders.  And I drank shakes from Burger King whenever I wanted.I had a lot of emotional growth in that time and the pervasive anxiety I had went away.  There was a day when I looked back and realized I just hadn't thought about the pain in my jaw for a long time.

This wasn't qualitative either; imaging technology shows activity unevenly occurs across every human body. Put an ice cube on someones hand, their left knee tissues may react. Put ice cube on another person's hand, back of their neck reacts not their left knee.Then there are stories of people missing the majority of their brain but only learned this medically after living a normal life; going to college, holding a career together for a couple decades.Brain-centrism was just as dumb as our other takes that attempt to demarcate a center to our center-less universe.

Very few people aspire to become powerlifters, etc.IMHO, it's a dangerous view to take, as it can lead to dismissal of a lot of fantastic use cases, and it leads to people dismissing meditation outright (\"No doctor, my friend said that if I just move correctly, I don't need strength training!\").And yes, similar to strength, there's no upper limit on training for things like focus, concentration, mindfulness.There's no 'need' for meditation sure, but by that logic there's no 'need' for most things.What seems to be true to me is that it's absolutely fantastic in terms of technologies available to us for self (and also society)-improvement.",

Bookmark management sucks and is too high friction for my brain to willingly engage in it.Third party managers don't hit the spot either. They all spread out over too large of a surface area, trying to do read it later or moodboards or canvases and whatever else, without offering much in the way of material improvements over built in bookmarks (aside from being cross-browser).",

I nodded along and wish OP had written more about their solutions!The problem for folks like me/us is fear of \"losing\" something, and like the OP. knowing that something can be saved and found again (or stumbled across) later solves the problem, whether it's ever searched for again. The act of \"hoarding\" actually scratches the itch for me. I'm fine to close a tab if it doesn't feel like I'm \"throwing it away forever.\" And bookmarking a site is just a slower way to lose something forever. It's not easily findable, and I won't take the time to organize my bookmarks into a nice hierarchy. That reminds me of those old \"internet yellow pages\" that were sold at Microcenter back in the early days. That's a silly, slow way to organize information for retrieval.I wish that 99% of my browser history was automatically indexed/recorded for later searching. I could imagine \"boosting\" particular links' importance with a bookmark concept, but I think you could also choose to elevate any site I spent a little bit longer on to actually read, or that I came back to later. If you added semantic search into that, and offline plain-text greppability, we'd really be in business. A lot of my searches boil down to \"Didn't I see a tool or HN post that solved this problem 6 to 12 months ago?\" Sometimes I find it again. Often I don't.I keep hoping that someone like Kagi (which I already happily pay for) will let me build my own personalized internet index consisting \"only\" of the tens of thousands of URLs I've seen...They've built some stuff that is kinda close, and they already have a good crawler/indexer.I have been using OneTab to quickly consolidate a lot of tabs to a single list of URLs, which actually does help me \"feel\" a bit better, but doesn't solve the semantic search issue.  It sounds like Karakeep (mentioned by @miladyincontrol) does some of what I want already, and that they're working on semantic search too, but it doesn't offer it yet.If anyone (including the OP) has something to help me auto-hoard, I'd love to hear it.",

Despite being a core browser feature, it's barely improved in decades...I'm often a visual person, similar to what the twitter longpost also describes---I miss Apple's spatial file manager and made heavy use of the drag-and-drop grid on the Windows 10 Start menu to pin apps in logical groups---but I don't really have any problems with bookmarks as they exist now in Firefox. I have as many bookmarks as some tab hoarders have tabs (last count around 2,000), and I drag them into a well-ordered hierarchy with the Firefox Bookmarks Sidebar (Ctrl+B to toggle show/hide).A hierarchy in a vertical sidebar has always seemed... Plenty visual, I guess? Do folks who have hundreds or thousands of tabs open also have as many files in their Desktop and Download folders and just search there too? What upgrades to bookmarks would make them significantly better than they are now?Hierarchy-as-directory is a good conceptual abstraction, and it has useful, well-established visual representations. I get ornery when software tries to conceal a useful hierarchy from the end-user (most often... the file system itself, as in the iPhone).I'll note that Firefox's \"keyword\" option for bookmarks is a killer feature for me: assign a keyword to a bookmark (e.g. \"hn\" for news.ycombinator.com or \"yt\" for www.youtube.com) and you can type those letters into the URL bar and instantly load the bookmark. It's kept me on Firefox for years, even though I'd prefer some of the security features and better process isolation of Chromium/Blink. I have a row common bookmarks in the Bookmarks Toolbar with favicons and names matched to their keywords and I've never needed or wanted a landing page with favorite sites.Bookmarks do seem worse to me in other browsers without keywords. Oddly, if I import my Firefox bookmarks into other browsers the keywords I made in Firefox still work, but I can't edit them or add new keywords in those other browsers. Maddening.",

I think having it pervade products in a much more subtle way is the future though.For example, if you close a youtube browser tab with a comment half written it will pop up an `alert(\"You will lose your comment if you close this window\")`. It does this if the comment is a 2 page essay or \"asdfasdf\". Ideally the alert would only happen if the comment seemed important but it would readily discard short or nonsensical input. That is really difficult to do in traditional software but is something an LLM could do with low effort. The end result is I only have to deal with that annoying popup when I really am glad it is there.That is a trivial example but you can imagine how a locally run LLM that was just part of the SDK/API developers could leverage would lead to better UI/UX. For now everyone is making the LLM the product, but once we start building products with an LLM as a background tool it will be great.It is actually a really weird time, my whole career we wanted to obfuscate implementation and present a clean UI to end users, we want them peaking behind the curtain as little as possible.

It does this if the comment is a 2 page essay or \"asdfasdf\". Ideally the alert would only happen if the comment seemed important but it would readily discard short or nonsensical input. That is really difficult to do in traditional software but is something an LLM could do with low effort.I don't think that's a great example, because you can evaluate the length of the content of a text box with a one-line \"if\" statement. You could even expand it to check for how long you've been writing, and cache the contents of the box with a couple more lines of code.An LLM, by contrast, requires a significant amount of disk space and processing power for this task, and it would be unpredictable and difficult to debug, even if we could define a threshold for \"important\"!",

The thing doesn't randomly interject when I'm doing other things and I asked it nothing. I swing a hammer, it drives a nail. The hammer doesn't decide that the thing it's swinging at is vaguely thumb-shaped and self-destruct.Too many product managers nowadays want AI to not just be a tool, they want it to be magic. But magic is distracting, and unpredictable, and frequently gets things wrong because it doesn't understand the human's intent. That's why people mostly find AI integrations confusing and aggravating, despite the popularity of AI-as-a-tool.",

This run on hardware will ultimately drive hardware prices up everywhere.The knock on effect is that hardware manufacturers are likely going to spend less money doing R&D for consumer level hardware.

But the very heterogeneous fleet of devices that Tailscale users have is very difficult to support out of the box.

Different solutions will give different benefits and drawbacks. Me and a friend wrote a remote password provider for Debian called Mandos which uses machines on the local network as a way for unattended boots. It does not address the issue of tampering with the bios/boot loader, but for the primary purpose of protecting against someone stealing the server/disks it serves the purpose of allowing us to use encrypted disk without drawbacks of typing in passwords, and the backup server, itself with encrypted disks, handles the risk of needing recovery passwords.

The idea is to generate a signing key inside of the TPM and use it to send signatures to our control plane and other nodes, proving that it's the same node still. (The difference from node state encryption is that an attacker can still steal the node credentials from memory while they are decrypted at runtime).We started by always generating hardware attestation keys on first start or loading them from the TPM if they were already generated (which seemed safe enough to do by default). That loading part was causing startup failures in some cases.To be honest, I didn't get to the bottom of all the reports in that github issue, but this is likely why for some users setting `--encrypt-state=false` didn't help.",

I had a think about why I won't & it struck me that there's a funny dichotomy with AI tools:1. all of the above are things the typical vibe coder stereotypes I've encountered simply do not really care deeply about2. people that care about the above things are less likely to care enough about AI tools to commit their personal time to reporting & debugging these issuesThere's bound to be exceptions to these stereotypes out there but I doubt there's sufficient numbers to make AI tooling good.",

The code parses these headers as object keys and tries to sort them using semver's .gt() function, which can't parse version strings with date suffixes.\n\n  Affected functions: W37, gw0, and an unnamed function around line 3091 that fetches recent release notes.\n\n  Fix: Wrap version strings with semver.coerce() before comparison.

What's really interesting is how it reveals the economic implications - not just that shipping slows seasonally, but how companies plan infrastructure investments around these natural bottlenecks. The cold-water port shutdowns create cascading effects throughout global supply chains that we rarely discuss explicitly.It would be fascinating to see this data overlaid with commodity prices and exchange rates during those seasonal transitions.

I always use the command line version, and it works perfectly fine and it's FOSS.I find the syntax to Typst to be generally better than LaTeX. I don't like its equations as much, but Typst has one huge advantage that makes it easier to forgive its faults: it compiles several orders of magnitude faster than LaTeX.  This might not sound like much but it honestly sort of changes how you even think about problems.  I keep Neovim open on the left, run `typst watch` in the background, and Evince on the right, and my updates show up immediately upon saving.Also, adding plugins and libraries is trivial. All you have to do is declare it at the top of the file and it will automatically fetch it, which is considerably easier than LaTeX.I don't like the default font it ships with, but it's easy enough to add a Latin Modern font and get something that looks like LaTeX.Before Typst, I had typically been using Pandoc with Markdown to write my documents, and that served me well for quite awhile, but it had the disadvantage of being extremely slow to compile.  A slide deck that I gave last year [1] would take a bit more than a minute to compile.  This became an issue because I had to make a few small last-minute changes and having to wait an entire minute to view them actually made it so I was really pushing against the wire.If I had done my slides in Typst, they would have compiled in about 40 milliseconds, they wouldn't have looked any worse, and I'd have a syntax not dissimilar to Markdown.  I'm pretty much a convert at this point.[1] https://git.sr.ht/~tombert/lambda_days_2025",

That assumed meaning being that it's not okay to support people that support evil regimes. Even if that support is minimal and indirect.Would you buy an art book by a Nazi officer in 1942? After all, the officer would only receive a very small portion of the proceeds of the book, in reality providing an infinitesimal benefit to the Nazi party itself. Would you recommend said book to people you know? After all, you wouldn't be providing even that tiny amount of material support. And after all, it's simply the creative work of another human, unrelated to the war or atrocities, not representing the interests of the Nazi party itself.I'm sure that there are plenty of people that will show up to argue that actually, yes, they would gladly buy the book if they liked it and they would recommend it. And some will have the logical devices to show that there are no moral obligations involved. I disagree. Generally speaking, each of us only have tiny levers to pull, and we should pull them.",

Often it's these companies that are pushing for more stringent privacy laws and practices. For example, they could claim that they cannot share anonymized data with academic researchers, because of xyz virtuous privacy rules, when they are actually the ones making money off of selling patient data. It's an interesting phenomenon I have observed while working in the industry that seems to refute your claim that \"there's no money in privacy\".  Another way to think about it is that they want to induce a lower overall supply for the commodity they are selling, and they do this by championing privacy rules.",

Probably why it's rare to begin with; though generally, open source provides a refuge from this by removing (or reducing) the financial incentive.I think there's a a bit more of fundamental difference. For art, film, and books, the output isn't really intended to be functional as much as aesthetic. Buildings do also have function, but they're also visually striking even to those who aren't architects. Software usually has some functional goal beyond just aesthetics, which for most people makes the code a means to an end rather than the end itself. Most people generally don't spend a lot of time appreciating the individual pigments of a painting or the engineering behind making the skeleton of the building that ensures it stands up either.",

He told me how he was burning hundreds of iPads and everything electronic in open pits there as they were pulling out and that the smoke screwed him up (he told me shortly after getting back). Then ten years later he's diagnosed with the brain tumors (now).",
