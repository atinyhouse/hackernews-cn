Sold ours a year ago and got by with Uber, rentals, taxis. Life changed a bit and we needed something more predictable. I was planning to buy something used and boring and didn’t really care what.My wife asked, “What about an EV?” We can’t charge in our rental garage, but there’s a Tesla Supercharger literally across the street. Took a Tesla test drive mostly out of curiosity.And… I drove maybe 1% of that drive. The rest was on full self driving (FSD).Fast forward, I now own a Tesla, and about 99% of my driving is on FSD.Important context: when we picked it up, it was still on v13. It immediately made an illegal turn and scared some pedestrians in a crosswalk. So yes, I get the concern and skepticism. I had it too.Then v14.2 landed.Whatever they changed in that release feels real. It’s not just incremental. It feels like a different system. Elon says “we finally cracked it” (and probably says that all the time), so take that with a grain of salt, but with my very small sample size… it kind of looks like they might have.Two moments that really stuck with me:While self-driving, the car clearly anticipated a bus making a massive wide turn into our lane and hung way back until the maneuver was complete. It saw that developing long before I did.At ~70 mph, I was mid lane-change with my blinker on when a driver towing a large trailer decided to drift into the same lane without checking their blind spot. The Tesla instantly aborted the lane change and smoothly moved back, avoiding what would’ve been a nasty accident. No panic, no hard braking, no drama.I know this probably sounds like shilling. I’m not interested in the politics and don’t want to defend any of that. But it genuinely feels like stepping into the future, and honestly a much safer way to drive.I want Rivian, Waymo, whoever to nail this too. I hope they do. But right now, Tesla seems to actually have something that crossed a line from “demo” to “wow, this is real.”I didn’t expect to come away thinking that. But here we are.",

The main issue with prismatic cells is that to be safe, they must be made with LFP chemistry, which hurts energy density. LFP is also worse at charging/discharging when cold, though battery management software mostly solves that.Cylindrical cells make sense for higher performance NMC and NCA chemistries, as they can be cooled more easily (coolant lines can run in the voids between cylindrical cells), and any single cell failure is less likely to cascade to other cells. Batteries with cylindrical cells were easier to repair, but nowadays cells are welded together instead of bolted, so that's no longer an advantage.",

Applying the same transfer function to all pixels corresponds pretty tightly to film & paper exposure in analog photography. So one reasonable followup question is: did we count manually over- or under-exposing an analog photo to be manipulation or “processing”? Like you can’t see an image without exposing it, so even though there are timing & brightness recommendations for any given film or paper, generally speaking it’s not considered manipulation to expose it until it’s visible. Sometimes if we pushed or pulled to change the way something looks such that you see things that weren’t visible to the naked eye, then we call it manipulation, but generally people aren’t accused of “photoshopping” something just by raising or lowering the brightness a little, right?When I started reading the article, my first thought was, ‘there’s no such thing as an unprocessed photo that you can see’. Sensor readings can’t be looked at without making choices about how to expose them, without choosing a mapping or transfer function. That’s not to mention that they come with physical response curves that the author went out of his way to sort-of remove. The first few dark images in there are a sort of unnatural way to view images, but in fact they are just as processed as the final image, they’re simply processed differently. You can’t avoid “processing” a digital image if you want to see it, right? Measuring light with sensors involves response curves, transcoding to an image format involves response curves, and displaying on monitor or paper involves response curves, so any image has been processed a bunch by the time we see it, right? Does that count as “processing”?

Congratulations, you just wasted yourself many hours of precious time.> The price of convenience is difficulties to scaleOf course, they never scale.

Also, building the interpreter such that it would successfully run Rails wasn't trivial.  Not that hard, but enough that a convenience wrapper mattered.  So you had a whole generation of web devs coming up in an environment where the core language wasn't the first touchpoint, and there wasn't an assumption that you could (or should) rely on what you could apt-get install on the base OS.This is broadly an extremely good thing.But the critical thing that RVM did was that it broke the circular dependency at the core of the problem: it didn't itself depend on having a working ruby interpreter.  Prior to that you could observe a sort of sniffiness about tools for a language which weren't implemented in that language, but RVM solved enough of the pain that it barged straight past that.Then you had similar tools popping up in other languages - nvm and leiningen are the first that spring to mind, but I'd also throw (for instance) asdf into the mix here - where the executable that you call to set up your environment has a '#!/bin/bash' shebang line.Go has sidestepped most of this because of three things: 1) rigorous backwards compatibility; 2) the simplest possible installation onramp; 3) being timed with the above timeline so that having a pre-existing `go` binary provided by your OS is unlikely unless you install it yourself.  And none of those are true of Python.  The backwards compatibility breaks in this period are legendary, you almost always do have a pre-existing Python to confuse things, and installing a new python without breaking that pre-existing Python, which your OS itself depends on, is a risk.

Devs hate middlemen who silently fuck up their software and leave upstream with the mess, users hate being restricted to whatever software was cool and current two years ago. If they use a rolling distro, they hate the constant brokenness that comes with it. Of the 1% of people who don't hate this situation 99% of those merely tolerate it, and the rest are Debian developers who are blinded by ideology and sunk costs.Good operating systems should:1.

Side-effect free imports and construction. You should be able to load all the code files and construct an instance of every class in your app without a network connection spawning. This is harder than it sounds and without it you run into all sorts of trouble with the rest.3. Zero mocks and shared global state. By mocks, I mean mocking frameworks which override functions on existing types or global. These effectively are injecting lies into the type checker.Should put to tsgo which has dramatically lowered our type checking latency. As the tok/sec of models keeps going up, all the time is going to get bottlenecked on tool calls (read: type checking and tests).With this approach we now have near 100% coverage with a test suite that runs in under 1,000ms."

There is NO \"natural\" or \"universal\" formality or even authority without human social input.I would also argue that, though most users cannot distinguish between a serif and sans serif font, they DO understand the serif fonts connote formality. eg in high school they were told to submit their papers in a serif font, or where they read a court opinion they also read serif (even if not the same font).Sure, the State Department could have selected a different serif font.

There is NO \"natural\" or \"universal\" formality or even authority without human social input.I would also argue that, though most users cannot distinguish between a serif and sans serif font, they DO understand the serif fonts connote formality. eg in high school they were told to submit their papers in a serif font, or where they read a court opinion they also read serif (even if not the same font).Sure, the State Department could have selected a different serif font. But a reversion to what was previously used seems completely normal.Secondarily, I do think Calibri looks far too casual for the State Department.

Here are our CEO Luc(as) de Groot’s thoughts on the matter:Back to bad...Deciding to ditch Calibri as a ‘wasteful diversity’ font is both hilarious and sad. I designed Calibri to make reading on modern computer screens easier, and in 2006 Microsoft chose it to replace Times New Roman as the default font in the Office suite. Microsoft moved away from Times for good reasons. Calibri performs exceptionally well at small sizes and on standard office monitors, whereas serif fonts like Times New Roman create more visual disturbance. Although serif fonts work well on high-resolution displays, such as those found on modern smartphones, the serifs can introduce unnecessary visual noise on typical office screens and be particularly problematic for users with impaired vision, such as older adults.Professional typography can be achieved with serif or sans serif fonts. However, that is not very easy with Times New Roman, a typeface older than the current president. Originally crafted in Great Britain for newspaper printing, Times was optimised for paper, with each letterform meticulously cut and tested for specific sizes. In the digital era, larger-size drawings were repurposed as models, resulting in a typeface that appears too thin and sharp when printed at a high quality.Depending on the situation, fonts with serifs are often considered more classic, but they take more work to get right. While a skilled typographer can produce excellent results with Times New Roman, using the digital default version is not considered professional practice. This font only offers two weights, Regular and Bold, and the Bold version has a very different design that does not fit well. There are many better serif typefaces available. The digital version of Times New Roman, developed in the early days of computing, includes only minimal adjustments to letter pairs. This is particularly noticeable in all-capital words such as ‘CHICAGO’, where the spacing is inconsistent: the letters ‘HIC’ are tightly packed, while ‘CAG’ are spaced too far apart. By contrast, Calibri incorporates extensive spacing adjustments and language-specific refinements.This decision takes the administration back to the past and back to bad.(Microsoft could not rectify spacing issues in Times New Roman without altering the appearance of existing documents.)",

It was also promoted as “web-safe,” meaning webmasters could reasonably assume it would render properly across platforms. In the early era of digitalization, choosing Times New Roman was often less a deliberate endorsement than a default imposed by limited options. Over time, the habit hardened into a standard, and institutions began to require it without much reflection, effectively borrowing their own authority to confer authority upon the typeface."

The truth is none of these processes are actually going to make things more secure, and many projects went belly up despite following these kinds of recommendations.That being s人工智能d, I am grateful to F-Droid fighting the good fight. They are providing an invaluable service and I, for one, am even more grateful that they are doing it as uncompromisingly as possible (well into discomfort) according to their principles."

It's the increasing dependency on such approaches that bothers me.Docker was conceived to solve the problem of things \"working on my machine\", and not anywhere else. This was generally caused by the differences in the configuration and versions of dependencies. Its approach was simple: bundle both of these together with the application in unified images, and deploy these images as atomic units.Somewhere along the lines however, the problem has mutated into \"works on my container host\". How is that possible? Turns out that with larger modular applications, the configuration and dependencies naturally demand separation. This results in them moving up a layer, in this case creating a network of inter-dependent containers that you now have to put together for the whole thing to start...  and we're back to square one, with way more bloat in between.Now hardware virtualization. I like how AArch64 generalizes this: there are 4 levels of privilege baked into the architecture. Each has control over the lower and can call up the one immediately above to request a service. Simple. Let's narrow our focus to the lowest three: EL0 (classically the user space), EL1 (the kernel), EL2 (the hypervisor). EL0, in most operating systems, isn't capable of doing much on its own; its sole purpose is to do raw computation and request I/O from EL1. EL1, on the other hand, has the powers to directly talk to the hardware.Everyone is happy, until the complexity of EL1 grows out of control and becomes a huge attack surface, difficult to secure and easy to exploit from EL0. Not good. The naive solution? Go a level above, and create a layer that will constrain EL1, or actually, run multiple, per-application EL1s, and punch some holes through for them to still be able to do the job—create a hypervisor. But then, as those vaguely defined \"holes\", also called system calls and hyper calls, grow, won't so the attack surface?Or in other words, with the user space shifting to EL1, will our hypervisor become the operating system, just like docker-compose became a dynamic linker?",

I suggest that linker script `INSERT BEFORE/AFTER` for orphan sections (https://reviews.llvm.org/D74375 ) served as a key mitigation.I hope that a range extension thunk ABI, similar to AArch64/Power, is defined for the x86-64 psABI.\nIt is better than the current long branch pessimization we have with -mcmodel=large.---It seems that nobody has run into this .eh_frame_hdr implementation limitation yet* `.eh_frame_hdr -> .text`: GNU ld and ld.lld only support 32-bit offsets (`table_enc = DW_EH_PE_datarel | DW_EH_PE_sdata4;`) as of Dec 2025."

          "content": "Do note thought that X25519 and Ed25519 were designed so they wouldn’t need those checks at all.  It’s only when you’re trying to design fancier protocols on top of Curve25519 or Edwards25519 that you can run into subgroup issues.And for those use cases, I personally try my best to just reproject everything back into the prime order subgroup whenever possible.  Monocypher has a number of such fancy functions:  crypto_x25519_dirty_fast()\n  crypto_x25519_dirty_small()\n  crypto_elligator_map()\n  crypto_elligator_rev()\n  crypto_elligator_key_pair()\n\nThe dirty functions explicitly produce public keys that cover the entire curve, so that random such keys are truly indistinguishable from random when converted with `crypto_elligator_rev()`.  But instead of just removing the clamp operation, I instead add random low-order point, so that when we later use the point in an X25519 key exchange, the shared secret is exactly the same as it would have been for a genuine X255119 key.That’s where I thank DJB for designing a key exchange protocol that project the shared secret to the prime order subgroup, even when the public key it processes is not.  The original intent may have been to make checks easier (low order keys all end up yielding zero), but a nice side effect is how it enabled a nice API for Mike Hamburg’s Elligator2.> Accepting points outside the prime-order subgroup can quietly undermine higher-level assumptions, even if no immediate exploit is obvious.If on the other hand we can prove that all computed results are low-order-component-independent (as is the case for X25519), then we know for sure we’re safe.

          "content_cn": "Do note thought that X25519 and Ed25519 were designed so they wouldn’t need those checks at all.  It’s only when you’re trying to design fancier protocols on top of Curve25519 or Edwards25519 that you can run into subgroup issues.And for those use cases, I personally try my best to just reproject everything back into the prime order subgroup whenever possible.  Monocypher has a number of such fancy functions:  crypto_x25519_dirty_fast()\n  crypto_x25519_dirty_small()\n  crypto_elligator_map()\n  crypto_elligator_rev()\n  crypto_elligator_key_p人工智能r()\n\nThe dirty functions explicitly produce public keys that cover the entire curve, so that random such keys are truly indistinguishable from random when converted with `crypto_elligator_rev()`.  But instead of just removing the clamp operation, I instead add random low-order point, so that when we later use the point in an X25519 key exchange, the shared secret is exactly the same as it would have been for a genuine X255119 key.That’s where I thank DJB for designing a key exchange protocol that project the shared secret to the prime order subgroup, even when the public key it processes is not.  The original intent may have been to make checks easier (low order keys all end up yielding zero), but a nice side effect is how it enabled a nice 应用程序接口 for Mike Hamburg’s Elligator2.> Accepting points outside the prime-order subgroup can quietly undermine higher-level assumptions, even if no immediate exploit is obvious.If on the other hand we can prove that all computed results are low-order-component-independent (as is the case for X25519), then we know for sure we’re safe.  In the end, Ristretto is only really needed when we can’t tweak the protocol to safely reproject to the prime order subgroup.Don’t get me wrong, having a prime order group abstraction does help.  But if someone is qualified to design a protocol that may require this, they’re qualified to try and make it work with a non-trivial cofactor as well — that, or prove it cannot be done."

So I just opened it, stared at it for a while, and after considering the symptoms (no click in the door locking mechanism but power indicator light turning on), I realized the issue will be with something very early on in the fixed washing cycle, before the timing motor gets activated, and there will be no serious electrical damage elsewhere (fuse intact). So I looked at the door locking mechanism (bi-metalic thing) and noticed that the cable connector leading to it was slightly shifted. Re-seated the connector, and the machine started working again.While it was open, I didn't notice anything horrible (corrosion, leaks, nothing). Probably the next thing that will \"break\" will be when the motor's carbon brushes will \"run out\". :)You can understand and diagnose these things even without knowing too much.

The Feynman Lectures on Physics are a fantastic supplement and a great reference for people who already have a solid background. They’re not a practical introduction. Feynman acknowledged in his preface that, as an intro physics course, the Lectures were a failed experiment.Especially as a beginner it’s possible to read along with the Feynman Lectures and think you’re getting it, without really getting very much.Another way you may hear this same point: “only Feynman could get away with doing things in this crazy unrigorous way. You better do things normal and check obsessively, and understand the normal approach very clearly before you do anything weird.” That’s mostly fair but it’s  incomplete. Feynman also  checked the living shit out of everything he wrote. He just doesn’t show all the checking, so he appears to be fast and loose.",
