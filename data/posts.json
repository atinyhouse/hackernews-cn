      "abstract": "该讨论围绕《60分钟》节目关于CECOT的调查报道被推迟播出的争议展开。核心话题涉及媒体审查、政治干预和商业利益对新闻报道的影响。\n\n社区普遍认为报道因外部压力被压制，并赞赏互联网档案馆等平台在保存敏感内容中的作用。有用户指出，事件的反常曝光反而引发了更广泛的关注，符合“史翠珊效应”。讨论中提到，节目在加拿大电视台的意外泄露表明撤稿决定是在最后阶段做出的。\n\n主要分歧在于对事件背后动机的分析。有人认为这是甲骨文创始人拉里·埃里森等富豪利用资本操纵舆论的例证，批评这种“自由市场最大化”行为对经济平衡的破坏。也有用户指出这实质上是“国家资本主义”行为，涉及政府监管被俘获、通过政治关系获取合同等问题。另有观点将此事与派拉蒙收购华纳兄弟探索公司的商业背景联系起来，推测媒体机构的编辑决策可能受到并购交易中寻求政府批准的影响。\n\n讨论中用户分享了直接下载链接和记者内部邮件等资料，体现了社区对信息透明的重视。",

          "content": "What's free market about total state regulatory capture, calling the President when your bids get rejected, or setting up wars and domestic police actions to enrich yourself with contracts using taxpayer funds?There are legitimate criticisms of a pure free market, but this is \"state capitalism\" not a free market.The Trump administration is absolutely not pro free market. They're putting fingers on the scale all over the place, taking Federal positions in private companies, taking literal bribes for regulatory favors, influencing the selection of executives and board members, and using the power of the state to attack privately owned companies for platforming speech they don't like (like this 60 Minutes segment, made by a private company). Trump/MAGA looks a lot more like the CCP than anything else.Of course if you pay attention to the discourse, MAGA and national conservatism are an explicit repudiation of Reagan/Clinton \"neoliberalism\" and \"libertarian conservatism.\" They explicitly support a large administrative state that centrally plans the economy and culture, just one they run and use to push right wing and nationalist agendas.I remember saying back during the Bush years: if the right is forced to choose between liberty and cultural conservatism, they will throw out liberty. The right only supports the freedom to do what they think people should be doing. (Yes, there are similar attitudes in some parts of the left too. There are not many principled defenders of individual liberty.)Edit: I'm really just arguing that we should call things what they are. Calling MAGA's CCP-like state capitalism a free market is like calling Bernie Sanders or Mamdani communism (they're socialists, not communists, these are not the same) or calling old school conservative republicans fascists. Words mean things.",

          "content": "Here's why Bari Weiss delayed the story:Hi all,I’m writing with specific guidance on what I’d like for us to do to advance the CECOT story. I know you’d all like to see this run as soon as possible; I feel the same way. But if we run the piece as is, we’d be doing our viewers a disservice.Last month many outlets, most notably The New York Times, exposed the horrific conditions at CECOT. Our story presents more of these powerful testimonies—and putting those accounts into the public record is valuable in and of itself. But if we’re going to run another story about a topic that has by now been much-covered we need to advance it. Among the ways to do so: does anyone in the administration or anyone prominent who defended the use of the Alien Enemies Act now regret it in light of what these Venezuelans endured at CECOT? That’s a question I’d like to see asked and answered.- At present, we do not present the administration’s argument for why it sent 252 Venezuelans to CECOT. What we have is Karoline Leavitt’s soundbite claiming they are evildoers in America (rapists, murderers, etc.). But isn’t there much more to ask in light of the torture that we are revealing? Tom Homan and Stephen Miller don’t tend to be shy. I realize we’ve emailed the DHS spox, but we need to push much harder to get these principals on the record.- The data we present paints an incongruent picture. Of the 252 Venezuelans sent to CECOT, we say nearly half have no criminal histories. In other words, more than half do have criminal histories. We should spend a beat explaining this. We then say that only 8 of the 252 have been sentenced in America for violent offenses. But what about charged? My point is that we should include as much as we can possibly know and understand about these individuals.- Secretary Noem’s trip to CECOT. We report that she took pictures and video there with MS-13 gang members, not TdA members, with no comment from her or her staff about what her goal on that trip was, or what she saw there, or if she had or has concerns about the treatment of detainees like the ones in our piece. I also think that the ensuing analysis from the Berkeley students is strange. The pictures are alarming; we should include them. But what does the analysis add?- We need to do a better job of explaining the legal rationale by which the administration detained and deported these 252 Venezuelans to CECOT. It’s not as simple as Trump invoking the Alien Enemies Act and being able to deport them immediately. And that isn’t the administration’s argument. The admin has argued in court that detainees are due “judicial review”—and we should explain this, with a voice arguing that Trump is exceeding his authority under the relevant statute, and another arguing that he’s operating within the bounds of his authority. There’s a genuine debate here. If we cut down Kristi Noem analysis we’d have the time.My general view here is that we do our viewers the best service by presenting them with the full context they need to assess the story. In other words, I believe we need to do more reporting here.I am eager and available to help. I tracked down cell numbers for Homan and Miller and sent those along. Please let me know how I can support you.Yours,Bari",

To kill the infestation, we must cut off the food source: our passiveness. This begins with everyday refusals—denying the petty bribe, rejecting the convenient lie, and defending the honest colleague. By maintaining high ethical standards in our own spheres of influence, we starve the corrupt hierarchy of the dead matter it needs to grow.We must also make the terrain uninhabitable for them. These organisms thrive in the dark, protected by silence. Therefore, we must actively expose them: documenting abuses, funding media samaritans, and organizing locally to demand transparency. When integrity becomes the standard again, the host becomes hostile to the parasite, isolating the invaders rather than letting them multiply.Without this resistance however, the society weakens until its greatest assets—its resources, minds, and institutions—are cannibalized by a regime of criminals. This is how nations collapse. We have seen this story in Africa, South America, and Russia. This plague is now upon us. But history is not destiny. We possess the power to stop it.

Earlier this year her site \"the Free Press\" was all over them [0]:>\"The hottest campaign stop is this Salvadoran supermax: House Republican Riley Moore went to the super maximum security prison in El Salvador to take some photos in front of the inmates. “I just toured the CECOT prison in El Salvador,” he writes, with pictures of him giving a thumbs-up, shirtless inmates standing at attention behind him. Moore gave a double thumbs-up in front of the men, densely packed in their cold metal bunk. Secretary of Homeland Security Kristi Noem took the same tour recently, posting a fun video in front of caged, tatted men.\">\"After Bukele left the White House, he thirstily tweeted, “I miss you already, President T.” Trump returned the favor, learning to say MAGA in Spanish: “¡America grande, otra vez!”\"Etc. And she's been very positive on Bukele personally as well.

The contention is that the Trump administration is threatening to block the merger (corruptly, in opposition to their republican proclivities) unless the news arm of the merged company is operated in a partisan way.And the evidence for that is that Ellison walked in, threw out CBS News's pre-existing leadership, and brought in a reasonably-well-known-but-still-not-celebrity-enough-to-be-independent partisan republican voice to run it.

It’s not just Flock cams. It’s the data eng into these networks - 18 wheeler feed cams, flock cams, retail user nest cams, traffic cams, ISP data sales2. All in one hub, all searchable by your local PD and also the local PD across state lines who doesn’t like your abortion/marijuana/gun/whatever laws, and relying on:3. The PD to setup and maintain proper RBAC in a nationwide surveillance network that is 100%, for sure, no doubt about it (wait how did that Texas cop track the abortion into Indiana/Illinois…?), configured for least privilege.4. Or if the PD doesn’t want flock in town, they reinstall cameras against the ruling (Illinois iirc?) or just say “we have the feeds for the DoT cameras in/out of town and the truckers through town so might as well have control over it, PD!”Layer the above with the current trend in the US, and 2025 model Nissan uploading stop-by-stop geolocation and telematics to cloud (then, sold into flock? Does even knowing for sure if it does or doesn’t even matter?)Very bad line of companies. Again all is from primary sources who helped implement it over the years.

I would never trust the security of a system with RBAC at that level.And to elaborate on that -- for RBAC to have properly defined roles for the right people and ensure that there's no unauthorized access to anything someone shouldn't have access to, you need to know exactly which user has which access. And I mean all of them. Full stop. I don't think I'm being hyperbolic here. Everyone's needs are so different and the risks associated to overprovisioning a role is too high.When it's every LEO at the nation level that's way too many people -- it is pretty much impossible without dedicated people whose jobs it is to constantly audit that access. And I guarantee no institution or corporation would ever make a role for that position.I'm not even going to lean into the trustworthiness and computer literacy of those users.And that's just talking about auditing roles, never mind the constant bug fixes/additions/reductions to the implementation. It's a nightmare.Funny enough, just this past week I was looking at how my company's roles are defined in admin for a thing I was working on. It's a complete mess and roles are definitely overprovisioned. The difference is it's a low-stakes admin app with only ~150 corporate employees who access it. But there was only like 8 roles!Every time you add a different role, assign it to each different feature, and then give that role to a different user, it compounds.I took your comment at face value but I hope to god that Flock at least as some sort of data/application partitioning that would make overprovisioning roles impossible.

It's almost exclusively men stalking ex-partners or attractive women they don't know, but have seen in public.What's frightening is it's not rare, it actually happens constantly, and this is just within the systems which have a high level of internal logging/user-tracking.So now with Flock and data brokers we have authorities having access to information that was originally held behind a judge's signature. Often with little oversight, and frequently for unofficial, abusive purposes.This reality also ties back to the discussion about providing the \"good guys\" encryption backdoors. The reality is that there are no \"good guys\", everyone exists in shades of grey, and I dare say there are people in forces whom are attracted to the power the role provides, rather than any desire for public service.In conclusion it's a fundamental design flaw to rely on the operator being a \"good guy\", and that's before we get into the problem of leaks, bugs, and flaws in the security model, or in this case: complete open access to the public web - laughable, farcical, and horrifying.",

The nice thing about the \"everyone has access\" case is that it forces the public to decide what they think is acceptable instead of making it some abstract thing that their brains aren't able to process correctly.People will happily stand under mounted surveillance cameras all day long, but the moment they actually see someone point a camera at them they consider that a hostile action. The surveillance camera is an abstract concept they don't understand. The stranger pointing a camera in their direction is something they do understand and it makes their true feelings on strangers recording them very clear.We might need a little bit of \"everyone has access\" to convince people of the truth that \"no one should have access\" instead.",

If these were just dumb cameras, the state would have to hire an army of operators. As it stands, the technology allows for total surveillance with essentially zero marginal cost.

It seemed that the \"light is out means 4-way stop\" dynamic caused them to go into ultra-timid mode. And of course the human drivers did the typical slow and roll, with decent interleaving.The result was that each Waymo took about 4x as long to get through the intersections. I saw one Waymo get bluffed out of its driving slot by cross traffic for perhaps 8 slots.This was coupled with the fact that the Waymos seemed to all be following the same route. I saw a line of about a dozen trying to turn left, which is the trickiest thing to navigate.And of course I saw one driver get pissed off and drive around a Waymo that was advancing slowly, with the predictable result that the Waymo stopped and lost three more slots through the intersection.On normal days, Waymos are much better at the 4-way stops than they used to be a few years back, by which I mean they are no longer dangerously timid. The Zoox (Amazon) cars are more like the Waymos used to be.I expect there will be some software tweaks that will improve this situation, both routing around self-induced congestion and reading and crossing streets with dead lights.Note that I didn't see any actually dead Waymos as others have reported here. I believe this is an extreme failsafe mode, and perhaps related to just too much weirdness for the software to handle.It would be interesting to see the internal post mortem.",

Also other drivers are going through the intersection one by one, as if they think the light is not working.\"It's not enough to just analyze the camera data and see neither green nor yellow nor red. Other things can cause that, like a burned out bulb, a sensor hardware problem, a visual obstruction (bird on a utility cable), or one of those louvers that makes the traffic light visible only from certain specific angles.Since the rules are different depending on whether the light is functioning or not, you really need to know the answer, but it seems hard to be confident.

Way too many people just zoom through intersections with dark traffic lights like they're cruising unimpeded down the Interstate, obvious to their surroundings.  Some people get grumpy and lay on the horn as if to motivate those in front of them to fly through themselves.But many people do stop, observe, and proceed when it is both appropriate and safe.After awhile, it calms down substantially.  The local municipality rounds up enough stop signs to plant in the middle of the intersections that people seem to actually be learning what to do (as unlikely as that sounds).By day 2 or 3, it's still somewhat chaotic -- but it seems \"safe\" in that the majority of the people understand what to do (it's just stop sign -- it may be a stop sign at an amazingly-complex intersection, but it's still just a stop sign) and the flyers are infrequent-enough to look out for.By day 5 or 6, traffic flows more-or-less fine and it feels like the traffic lights were never necessary to begin with.  People stop.  They take turns.  They use their turn signals like their lives depend on it.  And the flyers apparently have flown off to somewhere else.  It seems impossible to behold, but I've seen it.But SF's outage seems likely to be a lot shorter than that timeline, and I definitely agree with Waymo taking the cautious route.(but I also see reports that they just left these cars in the middle of the road.  That's NFG.)",

One was when there was no car already stopped and about 10%-20% of drivers didn't realize there was an intersection with lights out and just raced through it.

          "content": "Obviously things will continue to improve, so this is a point in time criticism.One of the biggest issues with current state of tech I see is, where these cars usually are.  They're in cities, and most often in very dense ones, and ones in the south.  These are effectively perfect conditions.From my perspective, I wonder how these cars will behave with ice on the road, with snow, or a typical Montreal Wednesday of \"It's a blizzard, you can't see 10 feet, there is snow on the road and ice, it's slippery, all the lines and street markings are obscured completely, oh and the power is out and there are no traffic lights.\"Some of this can be resolved by snow tires, or even studded tires which are legal in Quebec.  It should be noted that Quebec plows the roads less, and uses less dirt and salt on the road, and also enforces a law that snow tires are on cars in the winter.  Of course studded tires give insane grip on ice, but have reduced grip on rain.And it can 10C and rain, then freeze, then be a blizzard, then move to -40C, all in a few days.But anyhow, my point is if a Waymo is slow with a missing traffic light, how will it act with a missing traffic light, and 10ft visual range of reflective snow in the air, no ability to see lines on the street, and so on.  Humans are great at peering and seeing mostly obscured indications of an intersection, but this is still challenging for a car with a top priority of safety.Here's another example.  The cameras in my car are constantly obscured by slush, dirt, and such on the windshield and all over the car.  All the roads are coated with dirt to help with slipping on ice.  I often have my car absurdly complaining that cameras are covered, and there's no assist this and that, just because the entire car is coated in dirt.How will a Waymo operate with all sensors covered in dirt?There are probably solutions.  But it feels like it will be a long while before such cars treat a normal day in winter, as usual.It should be noted that I've simply discussed downtown Montreal.  What of a rural area?  And by rural, I mean houses 1 km apart, also with a blizzard, all lines obscured on the road, and meanwhile Canadians just intuitively know where and how to drive it.  We just slow down a bit (from 120km/hr to maybe 70km/hr) and just drive on our merry way.  If we try to stop, distances are greatly extended, and of course in some places without care you'll just slide into the ditch.Of course that's just a Wednesday, and you can read the 'signs of the road', and sort of tell where to slow down more.  Where to take more care.Sometimes, you'll see a bunch of cars in the ditch, and think 'Ah, must be particularly slippery here', and slow down a bit more.",

(small, fast, ANSI-C). I appreciate certain ideas in Lua, and people love it, but I was never able to like Lua, because it departs from a more Algol-like syntax and semantics without good reasons, for my taste. This creates friction for newcomers. I love friction when it opens new useful ideas and abstractions that are worth it, if you learn SmallTalk or FORTH and for some time you are lost, it's part of how the languages are different. But I think for Lua this is not true enough: it feels like it departs from what people know without good reasons.",

          "content": "I don't love a good deal of Lua's syntax, but I do think the authors had good reasons for their choices and have generally explained them. Even if you disagree, I think \"without good reasons\" is overly dismissive.Personally though, I think the distinctive choices are a boon. You are never confused about what language you are writing because Lua code is so obviously Lua. There is value in this. Once you have written enough Lua, your mind easily switches in and out of Lua mode. Javascript, on the other hand, is filled with poor semantic decisions which for me, cancel out any benefits from syntactic familiarity.More importantly, Lua has a crucial feature that Javascript lacks: tail call optimization. There are programs that I can easily write in Lua, in spite of its syntactic verbosity, that I cannot write in Javascript because of this limitation. Perhaps this particular JS implementation has tco, but I doubt it reading the release notes.I have learned as much from Lua as I have Forth (SmallTalk doesn't interest me) and my programming skill has increased significantly since I switched to it as my primary language. Lua is the only lightweight language that I am aware of with TCO. In my programs, I have banned the use of loops. This is a liberation that is not possible in JS or even c, where TCO cannot be relied upon.In particular, Lua is an exceptional language for writing compilers. Compilers are inherently recursive and thus languages lacking TCO are a poor fit (even if people have been valiantly forcing that square peg through a round hole for all this time).Having said all that, perhaps as a scripting language for Redis, JS is a better fit. For me though Lua is clearly better than JS on many different dimensions and I don't appreciate the needless denigration of Lua, especially from someone as influential as you.",

The reason for this is because in around 2006, the sandbox game \"Garry's Mod\" was extended with scripting support and chose Lua for seemingly the same reasons as Redis.The game's author famously didn't like Lua, its unfamiliarity, its syntax, etc. He even modified it to add C style comments and operators. His new sandbox game \"s&box\" is based on C#, which is the language closest to his heart I think.The point I'm trying to make is just that Lua is familiar to me and not to you for seemingly no objective reason.

They also needed smoother frame pacing and we got a scheduler that Zuck is now using to run data centers.Its funny to think that Meta's server efficiency is being improved because Valve paid Igalia to make Elden Ring stutter less on a portable Linux PC.

Its business is games, game hardware, and game delivery.  For anything outside of that purview instead of trying to build a huge internal team they contract out.  I’m genuinely curious why other companies don’t do this style more often because it seems incredibly cost effective.  They hire top level contractors to do top tier work on hyper specific areas and everyone benefits.  I think this kind of work is why Valve gets a free pass to do some real heinous shit (all the gambling stuff) and maintain incredible good will.  They’re a true “take the good with the bad” kind of company.  I certainly don’t condone all the bad they’ve put out, and I also have to recognize all the good they’ve done at the same time.Back to the root point.

My kegworks wine wrapper for tf2 is currently broken as of last month because the game update download from wine steam keeps corrupting and I'm at a bit of a loss at this point how to work around it.

That would allow dimensioning them from command line arguments or sizes of input files.The type system then would have “pointer to an element of foo” types (could be implemented old-style as indices)Yes, that would limit things, but with today’s 64-bit address spaces I think it could work reasonably well for many systems programming tasks.It definitely would be significantly less complex than rust.",

          "content": "I have mostly been writing Rust in the last 10 years, but recently (1 year) I have been writing Go as well as Rust.The typical Go story is to use a bunch of auto generation, so a small change quickly blows up as all of the auto generate code is checked into git. Like easily a 20x blowup.Rust on the other hand probably does much more such code generation (build.rs for stuff like bindgen, macros for stuff like serde, and monomorphized generics for basically everything). But all of this code is never checked into git (with the exception of some build.rs tools which can be configured to run as commands as well), or at least 99% of the time it's not.This difference has impact on the developer story. In go land, you need to manually invoke the auto generator and it's easy to forget until CI reminds you. The auto generator is usually quite slow, and probably has much less caching smartness than the Rust people have figured out.In Rust land, the auto generation can, worst case, run at every build, best case the many cache systems take care of it (cargo level, rustc level). But still, everyone who does a git pull has to re-run this, while with the auto generation one can theoretically only have the folks run it who actually made changes that changed the auto generated code, everyone else gets it via git pull.So in Go, your IDE is ready to go immediately after git pull and doesn't have to compile a tree of hundreds of dependencies. Go IDEs and compilers are so fast, it's almost like cheating from Rust POV. Rust IDEs are not as fast at all even if everything is cached, and in the worst case you have to wait a long long time.On the other hand, these auto generation tools in Go are only somewhat standardized, you don't have a central tool that takes care of things (or at least I'm not aware of it). In Rust land, cargo creates some level of standardization.You can always look at the auto generated Go code and understand it, while Rust's auto generated code usually is not IDE inspectable and needs special tools for access (except for the build.rs generated stuff which is usually put inside the target directory).I wonder how a language that is designed from scratch would approach auto generation.",

The key differentiator seems to be \"zero-cost exceptions\" which I assume means compile-time Result types without runtime unwinding overhead? That's compelling if true, since Rust's Result ergonomics can get verbose in deeply nested error chains.But the real test is compile times and cognitive overhead. Rust's borrow checker is theoretically elegant but practically brutal when you're learning or debugging. If Rue can achieve memory safety without lifetime annotations everywhere, that's genuinely valuable. However, I'm skeptical - you can't eliminate tradeoffs, only move them around. If there's no borrow checker, what prevents use-after-free? If there's garbage collection, why claim \"lower level than Go\"?The other critical factor is ecosystem maturity. Rust's pain is partially justified by its incredible crate ecosystem - tokio, serde, axum, etc. A new language needs either (1) seamless C FFI to bootstrap libraries, (2) a killer feature so valuable that people rewrite everything, or (3) 5+ years for the ecosystem to develop. Which path is Rue taking?I'd love to see real-world benchmarks on: compile time for a 50k line project, memory usage of a long-running web server compared to Rust/Go, and cold start latency for CLI tools. Those metrics matter more than theoretical performance claims. The \"fun to write\" claim is subjective but important - if it's genuinely more ergonomic than Rust without sacrificing performance, that could attract the \"Python developers wanting systems programming\" demographic.",

With Cargo, I couldn't figure out how to do this. In test mode, it would still try to build it as a dylib.Later, well, the reason that rustc has to layer a build system on top of Cargo: bootstrapping. I'm not sure if Rue will ever be bootstrapped, but rustc uses x.py for this. Buck does it a lot nicer, IMHO https://github.com/dtolnay/buck2-rustc-bootstrap",

Instead, of borrowing, you have an inout parameter passing convention, like Swift. Struct fields cannot be inout, so you can't store borrowed references on the heap.I'm very interested in seeing how this works in practice--especially given who is developing Rue. It seems like Rust spends a lot of work enabling the borrow checker to be quite general for C/C++-like usage. E.g. you can store a borrowed reference to a struct on the stack into the heap if you use lifetime annotations to make clear the heap object does not outlive the stack frame. On the other hand it seems like a lot of the pain points with Rust in practice are not the lifetime annotations, but borrowing different parts of the same object, or multiple borrows in functions further down the call stack, etc.",

The level of abstraction is the number of implementations that are accepted for a particular interface (which includes not only the contract of the interface expressed in the type system, but also informally in the documentation). E.g. \"round\" is a higher abstraction than \"red and round\" because the set of round things is larger than the set of red and round things. It is often untyped languages that offer the highest level of abstraction, while a sophisticated type system narrows abstraction (it reduces the number of accepted implementations of an interface). That's not to say that higher abstraction is always better - although it does have practical consequences, explained in the next paragraph - but the word \"abstraction\" does mean something specific, certainly more specific than \"describing things\".How the level of abstraction is felt is by considering how many changes to client code (the user of an interface) is required when making a change to the implementation. Languages that are \"closer to the underlying machine\" - especially as far as memory management goes - generally have lower abstraction than languages that are less explicit about memory management. A local change to how a subroutine manages memory typically requires more changes to the client - i.e. the language offers a lower abstraction - in a language that's \"closer to the metal\", whether the language has a rich type system like Rust or a simpler type system like C, than a language that is farther away.",

The other is about how \"deeply\" you can control the execution, e.g. you have direct control of when and what gets allocated, or some control over vectorization, etc.Here Rust is obviously as low-level as C, if not more so (both have total control over allocations, but still leaves calling conventions and such up to the compiler), while go is significantly higher (the same level as C#, slightly lower than Java - managed language with a GC and value types).The other often mistaken spectrum is expressivity, which is not directly related to low/high levelness. E.g. both Rust and Scala are very expressive languages, but one is low, the other is high level. C and Go both have low expressivity, and one is low the other is high level.This answer is imo a very must have read about the topic of expressivity: https://langdev.stackexchange.com/a/2016",

All the JPEGs they send will get there eventually (unless the connection drops). JPEG does not fix your buffering and congestion control problems. What presumably happened here is the way they implemented their JPEG screenshots, they have some mechanism that minimizes the number of frames that are in-flight. This is not some inherent property of JPEG though.> And the size! A 70% quality JPEG of a 1080p desktop is like 100-150KB. A single H.264 keyframe is 200-500KB. We’re sending LESS data per frame AND getting better reliability.h.264 has better coding efficiency than JPEG. For a given target size, you should be able to get better quality from an h.264 IDR frame than a JPEG. There is no fixed size to an IDR frame.Ultimately, the problem here is a lack of bandwidth estimation (apart from the sort of binary \"good network\"/\"cafe mode\" thing they ultimately implemented). To be fair, this is difficult to do and being stuck with TCP makes it a bit more difficult. Still, you can do an initial bandwidth probe and then look for increasing transmission latency as a sign that the network is congested. Back off your bitrate (and if needed reduce frame rate to maintain sufficient quality) until transmission latency starts to decrease again.WebRTC will do this for you if you can use it, which actually suggests a different solution to this problem: use websockets for dumb corporate network firewall rules and just use WebRTC everything else",

If the client reports a stable latency range, and it is acceptable (<1s latency, <200ms variance?) and bandwidth use has reached 95% of H264 estimate, re-activate the streamGiven that text/code is what is being viewed, lower res and adaptive streaming (HLS) are not really viable solutions since they become unreadable at lower res.If remote screen sharing is a core feature of the service, I think this is a reasonable next step for the product.That said, IMO at a higher level if you know what you're streaming is human-readable text, it's better to send application data pipes to the stream rather than encoding screenspace videos.

I also highly suspect the vaapi encoder is not very good esp at low bitrates.I _think_ moonlight also forces CBR instead of VBR, which is pretty awful for this use case - imagine you have 9 seconds of 'nothing changing' and then the window moves for 0.25 seconds. If you had VBR the encoder could basically send ~0kbit/sec apart from control metadata, and then spike the bitrate up when the window moved (for brevity I'm simplifying here, it's more complicated than this but hopefully you get the idea).Basically they've used the wrong software entirely.

Even if you're listening to AAC encoded audio, it'll be transcoded again as 256kbps AAC over Bluetooth.Even no name earbuds on Amazon manage to not break Bluetooth and can offer cross platform high quality audio over Bluetooth.",

Companies either become dominant, or universally screw over their users. Users either have no choice, do not understand the choices, or simply don't care.I am glad the EU tries to do something. They aren't always right, but they should be trying. As a reminder, one of the biggest success stories of EU regulation: cheap cellular roaming within the EU.

We already have android on that level.You can have a reasonable requirement where Apple should not be able to block other companies from providing similar services based on an iphone. But clearly the directive here is that Apple's competing products should not be better based on better integration, which can only go in one direction. Apple degrades its own products to comply.

Game and engine devs simply don't bother anymore to optimize for the low end and thus they end up gatekeeping games and excluding millions of devices because for recent games, a discrete GPU is required even for the lowest settings.",

The other market AMD serves is Sony/MS for their consoles and I'd argue they're a major motivator driving radeon development as they pay up-front to get custom APU chips, and there's synergy there with Zen and more recently the AI demand. Ever since ATi bought up the company (ArtX) that made the Gamecube GPU it seems to me that the PC side is keeping the motor running in-between console contracts as far as gaming demands go, given their low market share they definitely don't seem to prioritize or depend on it to thrive.",

The costs of Z.ai’s monthly plans just increased a bit, but still inexpensive compared to Google/Anthropic/OpenAI.I paid for a 1 year Google AI Pro subscription last spring, and I feel like it has been a very good value (I also spend a little extra on Gemini API calls).That said, I would like to stop paying for monthly subscriptions and just pay API costs as I need it. Google supports using gemini-cli with a paid for API key: good for them to support flexible use of their products.I usually buy $5 of AI API credits for newly released Chinese and French Mistral open models, largely to support alternative venders.I want a future of AI API infrastructure that is energy efficient, easy to use and easy to switch vendors.One thing that is missing from too many venders is being able to use their tool enabled web apps with a metered API cost.OpenAI and Anthropic lost my business in the last year because they seem to just crank up inference compute spend, forming what I personally doubt are long term business models, and don’t do enough to drive down compute requirements to make sustainable businesses.",

Users basically always just went to Google or Amazon and searched there instead.However, shortly after we ran out of money and laid off most of the company, one of our engineers mastered the basics of SEO, and we discovered that users would click through Google to our site to an item listing, then through to make a purchase at a merchant site, and we became profitable.I suppose we were providing some value in the exchange, since the users were visiting our item listings which displayed the prices from all the various stores selling the item, and not just a naked redirect to Amazon or whatever, but we never turned any significant number of these click-throughs into actual users, and boy howdy was that demoralizing as the person working on the search functionality.Our shareholders had mostly written us off by that point, since comparison shopping had proven itself to not be the explosive growth area they'd hoped it was when investing, but they did get their money back through a modest sale a few years later.",

I appreciate that the rhetorical effect could feel like a sly way to slip in asymmetric gender standards about how to interpret divorce.But I am a pedantic person who prefers to focus on the literal statements in text rather than the perceived underlying emotional current. So I’ll pedantically plod through what she actually said.She’s dealing with two dimensions of divorce: who initiated it (husband, wife, or collaborative), and whether it was surprising or unsurprising.That gives several possibilities, but she lists three. What unifies them is that they are all written from the perspective of the abstract woman undergoing the experience.1. Woman initiated, surprise unspecified.2. Collaborative, so assume unsurprising.3. Man initiated, surprising (her situation).She doesn’t claim this covers all possibilities. The point of that bit is just to emphasize that divorces are different, and to object to treating them as a genre for wellness AI slop.Here is the original text containing that part so others can easily form their own opinion.“I also object to the flattening of the contours of my particular divorce. There are really important distinctions between the experiences of women who initiate their own divorces versus women who come to a mutual agreement with their spouses to end the marriage versus women, like me, who are completely blindsided by their husbands’ decisions to suddenly end the marriage. All divorces do involve self-discovery and rebuilding your life, but the ways in which you begin down that path often involve dramatically different circumstances.”",

But the thing is... that if this isn't what they steal they'll steal something else.Meanwhile locking down those apps so the only apps with a certain signature can read from your WhatsApp means that if you want to back up your messages or read them for any legitimate purpose you're now SOL, or reliant on a usually slow, non-automatable UI-only flow.I'm glad that modern computers are more secure than they have been, but I think that defense in depth by locking down everything and creating more silos is a problem of its own.",

I used to think that it was only NPM (I have worked a lot in this ecosystem over the years), but I have found this to be essentially everywhere: NPM is a poster child for this because of executable scripts on install, but every package manager essentially boils down to \"Install this thing by name, no security checks\". Every ecosystem I touch now (apart from gamedev, but only because I roll everything myself there by choice) has this - e.g Cargo has a lot of \"tools\" that you install globally so that you get some capability (like flamegraphs, asm output, test runners etc.) - this is the same vulnerability, manifesting slightly differently. Like others have pointed out, it is common to just pull random Docker images via Helm charts. It is also common to get random \"utility\" tools during builds in CI/CD pipelines, just by curl-ing random URLs of various \"release archives\". You don't even have to look too hard - this is surface level in pretty much every company, almost every industry (I have my doubts about the security theatre in some, but I have no first hand experience, so cannot say)The issue I have is that I don't really have a good idea for a solution to this problem - on one hand, I don't expect everyone to roll the entire modern stacks by hand every time. Killing collaborative software development seems like literally throwing the baby out with the bath water. On the other hand, I feel like nothing I touch is \"secure\" in any real sense - the tick boxes are there, and they are all checked, but I don't think a single one of them really protects me against anything - most of the time, the monster is already inside the house.",

But it shouldn't get ambient authority to access anything else on my computer. No network access. No filesystem. Nothing.Philosophically, I kind of think of it like function arguments and globals. If I call a function foo(someobj), then function foo is explicitly given access to someobj. And it also has access to any globals in my program. But we generally consider globals to be smelly. Passing data explicitly is better.But the whole filesystem is essentially available as a global that any function, anywhere, can access. With full user permissions. I say no. I want languages where the filesystem itself (or a subset of it) can be passed as an argument. And if a function doesn't get passed a filesystem, it can't access a filesystem. If a function isn't passed a network socket, it can't just create one out of nothing.I don't think it would be that onerous. The main function would get passed \"the whole operating system\" in a sense - like the filesystem and so on. And then it can pass files and sockets and whatnot to functions that need access to that stuff.If we build something like that, we should be able to build something like npm but where you don't need to trust the developers of 3rd party software so much.

Having experienced that in practice it... absolutely sucks.At this point it makes me feel like we need something like an async audit API. Maybe the OS just tracks and logs all of your apps' activity and then:1) You can view it of course.2) The OS monitors for deviations from expected patterns for that app globally (kinda like Microsoft's SmartScreen?)3) Your own apps can get permission to read this audit log if you want to analyze it your own way and/or be more secure. If you're more paranoid maybe you could use a variant that kills an app in a hurry if it's misbehaving.Sadly you can't even implement this as a third party thing on macOS at this point because the security model prohibits you from monitoring other apps.

With LLMs, a relatively small amount of text goes in and a relatively small amount of text comes out over a reasonably long amount of time. The amount of internal processing is huge relative to the size of input and output.

The trash company also complained when they had to pick it up and had to make a return trip.I kinda regret getting rid of it, but it was among the heaviest pieces of furniture in our house.",

In the 90s (~1993?), my family replaced our old 1970s-era 19\" Sony Trinitron with a HUGE new TV, a 35\" Toshiba.At the time, a \"big\" CRT was a 32\". I helped my dad transport the 35\" which, from memory, was 150 or 180lbs. It was likely the largest CRT commercially available. (PVM-4300 stragglers aside).A couple years later (1995-6?), a friend's family bought a 40\" Mitsubishi, which I _thought_ was the largest CRT made. But, again, Sony aside, it probably was.",

With the new layout, it would be impossible to bring back up the TV the way it was brought down.

          "content": "Projectors (front/rear/enclosed/whatever) could produce a huge image, but they had their own issues.In a bright room, the contrast was typically lacking.Even on relatively late versions like the Toshiba 57HX93 (a 57\" 16x9 doghouse from ~20 years ago with an integrated scaler and a 1080i input), which I personally spent some time with both in Toshiba form and as $10k Runco-branded units.  Things got washed out in a bright room compared to a direct-view CRT.And viewing angle is an issue, too:  Whether front- or rear-projection, one of the tricks to improve brightness (and therefore potential contrast) is to reduce the angle of light transmission from the screen.  Depending on the room layout, this can mean that people in seats off to the side might get a substantially darker image than those near the middle.  (This applies to all projectors; film, CRT, DLP, LCD, front, rear, whatever -- there can be a lot of non-obvious tech that goes into a projection screen.)And CRT projectors were fickle.  Their color convergence would change based on external magnetic fields (including that produced by the Earth itself), so they needed to be set up properly in-situ.  A projection set that was set up properly while facing East would be a different thing when rotated 90 degrees to instead face North:  What once was carefully-adjusted to produce 3 overlapping images that summed to be pure white lines would be a weird mix of red, blue, and green lines that only sometimes overlapped.The CRT tubes themselves were generally quite impressively small for the size of the image that they'd ultimately produce.  This meant pushing the phosphor coatings quite hard, which translated into an increased opportunity for permanent image retention (\"screen burn\") from things like CNN logos and video game scores.Plus:  They'd tend to get blurry over time.  Because they were being pushed hard, the CRTs were liquid-cooled using glycol that was supposed to be optically-clear.  But stuff would sometimes grow in there.  It was never clear whether this was flora or [micro]fauna or something else, but whatever it was liked living in a world filled with hot, brightly-lit glycol.  Service shops could correct this by changing the fluid, but that's an expense and inconvenience that direct-view CRTs didn't have.And they were ungainly things in other ways.  Sure, they tended to be lighter (less-massive) because they were full of air instead of leaded glass, but a rear-projection set was generally a big floor-standing thing that still had plenty of gravity.  Meanwhile, a front-projection rig ~doubled the chance of someone walking by occluding the view and came with the burden of a hard-to-clean screen (less important these days, but it used to be common for folks to smoke indoors) and its own additional alignment variables (and lens selection, and dust issues, and, and).So a person could deal with all that, or -- you know -- just get a regular direct-view CRT.Even today where projectors use friggin' laser beams for illumination and produce enormous, bright images with far fewer issues than I listed above, direct-view tech (like the flat LCD and *LED sets at any big-box) is still much more popular.(But I do feel your pain.  When I was a teenager, my parents came home from shopping one wintry night with a 36\" Sony WEGA for me to help unload.  Holy hell.)",

Divide that by 60 and you get 262.5, which is therefore the maximum vertical resolution (real world is lower for various reasons). CGA ran at 200 lines, so was safely possible with a 60Hz refresh rate.If you wanted more vertical resolution then you needed either a monitor with a higher horizontal refresh rate or you needed to reduce the effective vertical refresh rate. The former involved more expensive monitors, the latter was typically implemented by still having the CRT refresh at 60Hz but drawing alternate lines each refresh. This meant that the effective refresh rate was 30Hz, which is what you're alluding to.But the reason you're being downvoted is that at no point was the CRT running with a low refresh rate, and best practice was to use a mode that your monitor could display without interlace anyway.

You can still use AI and learn effectively if you are thoughtful about the way you apply it.100% rejecting AI as a learner programmer may feel like the right thing to do, but at this point it's similar to saying \"I'm going to learn to program without ever Googling for anything at all\".(I do not yet know how to teach people to learn effectively with AI though. I think that's a very important missing piece of this whole puzzle.)I'm a BIG fan of these three points though:  rewrite the parts you understand\n  learn the parts you don’t\n  make it so you can reason about every detail\n\nIf you are learning to program you should have a very low tolerance for pieces that you don't understand, especially since we now have a free 24/7 weird robot TA that we can ask questions of.",

Other times I feel like the UX of some dev tool is bad, and if I just quickly fix that, I can solve my problem faster, so down the rabbit hole we go, which is a different type of experience.Other times I'm focused on figuring out an elegant design/architecture for something that isn't problem solving, but more \"neat piece of software\", either a library or some other type that needs some sort of interface, be it library API or actual UI. Then I'll go into \"craftmanship\" mode and then most of the work actually happens away from the computer, mostly with pen and paper or whiteboards.I still think the latter is needed for improving the former, and high-quality and easy to maintain code is more important than ever, and if you only do the former, you'll get stuck at a ceiling while only doing the latter, you'll also get stuck if there isn't an actual need (at some level, \"fun\" can be a need) for it.",

          "content": "The Nagle algorithm was created back in the day of multi-point networking.  Multiple hosts were all tied to the same communications (Ethernet) channel, so they would use CSMA (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carrier-sense_multiple_access_...) to avoid collisions.  CSMA is no longer necessary on Ethernet today because all modern connections are point-to-point with only two \"hosts\" per channel.  (Each host can have any number of \"users.\")  In fact, most modern (copper) (Gigabit+) Ethernet connections have both ends both transmitting and receiving AT THE SAME TIME ON THE SAME WIRES.  A hybrid is used on the PHY at each end to subtract what is being transmitted from what is being received.  Older (10/100 Base-T) can do the same thing because each end has dedicated TX/RX pairs.  Fiber optic Ethernet can use either the same fiber with different wavelengths, or separate TX/RX fibers.  I haven't seen a 10Base-2 Ethernet/DECnet interface for more than 25 years.  If any are still operating somewhere, they are still using CSMA.  CSMA is also still used for digital radio systems (WiFi and others).  CSMA includes a \"random exponential backoff timer\" which does the (poor) job of managing congestion.  (More modern congestion control methods exist today.)  Back in the day, disabling the random backoff timer was somewhat equivalent to setting TCP_NODELAY.Dumping the Nagle algorithm (by setting TCP_NODELAY) almost always makes sense and should be enabled by default.",

          "content": "> The bigger problem is that TCP_QUICKACK doesn’t fix the fundamental problem of the kernel hanging on to data longer than my program wants it to. Well, of course not; it tries to reduce the problem of your kernel hanging on to an ack (or genearting an ack) longer than you would like. That pertains to received data. If the remote end is sending you data, and is paused due to filling its buffers due to not getting an ack from you, it behooves you to send an ack ASAP.The original Berkeley Unix implementation of TCP/IP, I seem to recall, had a single global 500 ms timer for sending out acks. So when your TCP connection received new data eligible for acking, it could be as long as 500 ms before the ack was sent. If we reframe that in modern realities, we can imagine every other delay is negligible, and data is coming at the line rate of a multi gigabit connection, 500 ms represents a lot of unacknowledged bits.Delayed acks are similar to Nagle in spirit in that they promote coalescing at the possible cost of performance. Under the assumption that the TCP connection is bidirectional and \"chatty\" (so that even when the bulk of the data transfer is happening in one direction, there are application-level messages in the other direction) the delayed ack creates opportunities for the TCP ACK to be piggy backed on a data transfer. A TCP segment carrying no data, only an ACK, is prevented.As far as portability of TCP_QUICKACK goes, in C code it is as simple as #ifdef TCP_QUICKACK. If the constant exists, use it. Otherwise out of luck. If you're in another language, you have to to through some hoops depending on whether the network-related run time exposes nonportable options in a way you can test, or whether you are on your own.",

We want to batch because batching usually allows for more efficient batched algorithms, locality, less overhead etc. You do not want to batch because that increases latency, both when collecting enough data to batch and because you need to process the whole batch.One class of solution is “Work or Time”. You batch up to a certain amount of work or up to a certain amount of time, whichever comes first. You choose your amount of time as your desired worst case latency. You choose your amount of work as your efficient batch size (it should be less than max throughput * latency, otherwise you will always hit your timer first).Nagle’s algorithm is “Work” being one packet (~1.5 KB) with “Time” being the time until all data gets a ack (you might already see how this degree of dynamism in your timeout might pose a problem already) which results in the fallback timer of 500 ms when delayed ack is on. It should be obvious that is a terrible set of parameters for modern connections. The problem is that Nagle’s algorithm only deals with the “Work” component, but punts on the “Time” component allowing for nonsense like delayed ack helpfully “configuring” your effective “Time” component to a eternity resulting in “stuck” buffers which is what the timeout is supposed to avoid. I will decline to discuss the other aspect which is choosing when to buffer and how much of which Nagle’s algorithm is again a special case.Delayed ack is, funnily enough, basically the exact same problem but done on the receive side. So both sides set timeouts based on the other side going first which is obviously a recipe for disaster. They both set fixed “Work”, but no fixed “Time” resulting in the situation where both drivers are too polite to go first.What should be done is use the generic solutions that are parameterized by your system and channel properties which holistically solve these problems which would take too long to describe in depth here.",

Perhaps on more modern hardware the thing to do with badly behaved senders is not ‘hang on to unfull packets for 40ms’ but another policy could still work, e.g. eagerly send the underfilled packet, but wait the amount of time it would take to send a full packet (and prioritize sending other flows) before sending the next underfull packet.2. In Linux there are packets and then there are (jumbo)packets. The networking stack has some per-packet overhead so much work is done to have it operate on bigger batches and then let the hardware (or a last step in the OS) do segmentation. It’s always been pretty unclear to me how all these packet-oriented things (Nagle’s algorithm, tc, pacing) interact with jumbo packets and the various hardware offload capabilities.3. This kind of article comes up a lot (mystery 40ms latency -> set TCP_NODELAY). In the past I’ve tried to write little test programs in a high level language to listen on tcp and respond quickly, and in some cases (depending on response size) I’ve seen strange ~40ms latencies despite TCP_NODELAY being set. I didn’t bother looking in huge detail (eg I took a strace and tcpdump but didn’t try to see non-jumbo packets) and failed to debug the cause. I’m still curious what may have caused this?",

Nagle prevents sending small packets if an ACK is outstanding, while the receiver delays that ACK to piggyback it on a response. When both are active, you get a 200ms \"deadlock\" where the sender waits for an ACK and the receiver waits for more data. This is catastrophic for latency-sensitive applications like gaming, SSH, or high-frequency RPCs.In modern times, the bandwidth saved by Nagle is rarely worth the latency cost. You should almost always set TCP_NODELAY = 1 for any interactive or request-response protocol. The \"problem\" only shifts to the application layer: if you disable Nagle and then perform many small write() calls (like writing a single byte at a time), you will flood the network with tiny, inefficient packets.Proper usage means disabling Nagle at the socket level but managing your own buffering in user-space. Use a buffered writer to assemble a logical message into a single memory buffer, then send it with one system call. This ensures your data is dispatched immediately without the overhead of thousands of tiny headers.

Writing via an in-process buffer (default behavior or stdio and quite a few programming languages) is not interchangeable with unbuffered writes — with a buffer, it’s okay to do many small writes, but you cannot assume that the data will ever actually be written until you flush.I’m a bit disappointed that Zig’s fancy new IO system pretends that buffered and unbuffered IO are two implementations of the same thing.",

Any imperfection in the local clock directly converts into timestamp error, and timestamp error is what limits PTP synchronization performance. Timestamps are the fundamental observable in PTP.\nQuantization and jitter create irreducible timestamp noise.\nThat noise directly limits offset and delay estimation.\nErrors accumulate across network elements and internal clock error must be much smaller than the system requirement.I think most people would look at the error and think \"what's the big deal\" but at all the telecoms customers would be scrambling to find a clock that hasn't fallen out of sync.",

They make reasoning about code in general easier, even if you never formally do any verification, it makes it easier to write tests or asserts(). A substantial amount of bugs are due to the program having a different state to that assumed by the programmer, and there are other tools that help with this. For example a statically typed language is a type of verification since it verifies a variable has a specific type and thus operations that can be performed on it, and limits the valid input and output range of any function. Languages like Rust are also verification in terms of memory correctness, and are also extremely useful tools.",

A simple litmus test is to take any of your recent day job task and try to describe a formal specification of it. Is it even doable? Reasonable? Is it even there? For me the most useful kind of verification is the verification of the lower level tools i.e. data structures, language, compilers etcFor example, the type signature of Vec::operator[usize] in Rust returns T. This cannot be true because it cannot guarantee to return a T given ANY usize. To me, panic is the most laziest and worst ways to put in a specification.

The problem is that calculating exact numbers for cache reads / writes is boring with lots of constants in them, and whenever we change the model a little bit the calculations have to be remade.It's a lot of boring constraints to solve, and the main bottleneck for me when I was trying to do it by hand was that I couldn't just trust the output of LLMs.",

It might make the language more approachable initially, and the idea of faster prototyping might be appealing, but it very quickly leads to maintenance problems and bugs. Before type hinting tools for Python became popular, I worked on many projects where `TypeError` was the #1 exception in Sentry by a large margin.Gradual and optional typing is better than nothing, but IME if the language doesn't require it, most programmers are lazy and will do the bare minimum to properly add type declarations. Especially with things like TypeScript, which makes many declarations difficult to read, write, and understand.I think that type inference is a solid middle ground. Types are still statically declared, but the compiler is smart enough to not bother the developer when the type is obvious.",

For example:- Fedora has a “lookaside cache”, and packagers upload tarballs to it. In theory they come from git as indicated by the source rpm, but I don’t think anything verifies this.- Python packages build a source tarball.  In theory, the new best practice is for a GitHub action to build the package and for a complex mess to attest that really came from GitHub Actions.- I’ve never made a Debian package, but AFAICT the maintainer kind of does whatever they want.IMO this is all absurd.  If a package hosted by Fedora or Debian or PyPI or crates.io, etc claims to correspond to an upstream git commit or release, then the hosting system should build the package, from the commit or release in question plus whatever package-specific config and patches are needed, and publish that. If it stores a copy of the source, that copy should be cryptographically traceable to the commit in question, which is straightforward: the commit hash is a hash over a bunch of data including the full source!",

So, if you ever hope to receive updates, or want to monitor a bug, you are also going to get spam.Again, because of the email-only design, one must memorise commands or reference a text file to take actions on bugs. This may be decent for power users but it’s a horrible UX for most people. I can only assume that there is some analogue to the `bugreport` command I don’t know of for maintainers that actually offers some amount of UI assistance. As a user, I have no idea how to close my own bugs, or even to know which bugs I’ve created, so the burden falls entirely on the package maintainers to do all the work of keeping the bug tracker tidy (something that developers famously love to do…).The search/bug view also does not work particularly well in my experience. The way that bugs are organised is totally unintuitive if you don’t already understand how it works. Part of this is a more general issue for all distributions of “which package is actually responsible for this bug?”, but Debian BTS is uniquely bad in my experience.

More art than science. They made me take the title and the stock options and the business cards.I mostly worked for and with EEs, making software tools for test automation. I was a fanboy hardware wannabee (and still am), got some on me but was never a true engineer. I learned from those who practiced their discipline; it was plain to me the reality of real engineering versus what I was doing.I suppose in my travels I have on occasion encountered a true Software Engineer. I suppose there's reason to hope that software development will continue to mature and evolve, and eventually the other engineering disciplines will accept software as a science.For me, it will always be a joy to make that hardware work with my twiddly bits.

If I look at a command like \"TRotateFloatCommand.DoIt\" in URotate.p, it's 200 lines long without a single comment. I look at a section like this and there's nothing literate about it. I have no idea what it's doing or why at a glance:  pt.h := BSR (r.left + ORD4 (r.right), 1);\n  pt.v := BSR (r.top + ORD4 (r.bottom), 1);\n  \n  pt.h := pt.h - BSR (width, 1);\n  pt.v := pt.v - BSR (height, 1);\n  \n  pt.h := Max (0, Min (pt.h, fDoc.fCols - width));\n  pt.v := Max (0, Min (pt.v, fDoc.fRows - height));\n  \n  IF width > fDoc.fCols THEN\n    pt.h := pt.h - BSR (width - fDoc.fCols - 1, 1);\n  \n  IF height > fDoc.fRows THEN\n    pt.v := pt.v - BSR (height - fDoc.fRows - 1, 1);\n  \nJust breaking up the function with comments delineating its four main sections and what they do would be a start. As would simple things like commenting e.g. what purpose 'pt' serves -- the code block above is where it is first defined, but you can't guess what its purpose is until later when it's used to define something else.Good code does not make comments unnecessary or redundant or harmful. This is a myth that needs to die. Comments help you understand code much faster, understand the purpose of variables before they get used, understand the purpose of functions and parameters before reading the code that defines them, etc. They vastly aid in comprehension. And those are just \"what\" comments I'm talking about -- the additional necessity of \"why\" comments (why the code uses x approach instead of seemingly more obvious approach y or z, which were tried and failed) is a whole other subject.",

Now with the next attempt, I think there's a lot of clarity in what bootstrapping gets you versus VC funding. Also solo vs team. Timelines are so different, the approach is so different. I don't think there is the same urgency in bootstrapping. You can have longer time horizons. With funding its a go-go-go attitude, especially with that finite funding. But even when it goes right and you became public, you are at the mercy of a quarterly report where you have to show something to keep that stock price propped up. I'm sure people running the company will say it doesn't make them think differently but the long termism breaks down a little unless you are pumping cash from somewhere.Anyway, if I had my shot again, I'm not saying I'd renounce funding. Bootstrapping for a short period to figure things out is great, but funding also creates opportunities where an immediate business model is not clear. Opportunities exist for different approaches. Again not an advocate for the VC funding, but I'd taken even $500k these days to get something up and running as the cost of capital is basically nothing aka YC.",

We will never fiddle with unicorns or set the world on fire, we just want to get along comfortably and be able to sleep at night.My top tip is to build up a current account balance that will cover the basics for your defined risk period.  So, for us that period is six months.  The basics are: Corporation tax, VAT and salaries.  You'll note I don't mention director's remuneration - that's a nice to have (for me).I have two customers at the moment that are dealing with going bankrupt, although one looks like they will be OK.  I refuse to join them.  Small business cash flow is hard, really hard.  It's so easy to be tempted to do something daft or to ignore warning signs.The world is a pretty hard place and not all tech companies get to spawn zillionares.

Jeff Bezos and Reid Hoffman tried much harder to raise, with far, far less built. Part of me wishes I had done that. I'm open to advice as to how to raise properly, should it be a Seed round or Series A at this point, and how to get meetings with the VCs and herd the cats in a way that will actually be successful. For reference, I'm based in NYC.PPS: I've had a lot more success and fun raising from angels (who make their own decisions about their own money) and remain open to it. Especially people who are aligned with what we're doing. I've found much of the VC signaling to be disingenuous (e.g. \"we love funding startups who do X\" actually means \"we want dealflow and orbiters to get into rounds with large well-known VCs\").

          "content": "Aaronson's take is characteristically grounded. The Willow chip announcement was impressive technically but the media coverage predictably overshot into \"RSA is dead\" territory when the actual achievement was improving error correction rates. The relevant timeline question is: when do quantum computers solve problems faster than classical computers for commercially useful tasks (not just contrived benchmarks)?The error correction milestone matters because it's the gate to scaling. Previous quantum systems had error rates that increased faster than you could add qubits, making large-scale quantum computing impossible. If Willow actually demonstrates below-threshold error rates at scale (I'd want independent verification), that unblocks the path to 1000+ logical qubit systems. But we're still probably 5-7 years from \"useful quantum advantage\" on problems like drug discovery or materials simulation.The economic argument is underrated. Even if quantum computers achieve theoretical advantage, they need to beat rapidly improving classical algorithms running on cheaper hardware. Every year we delay, classical GPUs get faster and quantum algorithms get optimized for near-term noisy hardware. The crossover point might be narrower than people expect.What I find fascinating is the potential for hybrid classical-quantum algorithms where quantum computers handle specific subroutines (like sampling from complex distributions or solving linear algebra problems) while classical computers do pre/post-processing. That's probably the first commercial application - not replacing classical computers entirely but augmenting them for specific bottlenecks. Imagine a drug discovery pipeline where the 3D protein folding simulation runs on quantum hardware but everything else is classical.",

When Frisch and Peierls wrote their now-famous memo in March 1940, estimating the mass of Uranium-235 that would be needed for a fission bomb, they didn’t publish it in a journal, but communicated the result through military channels only. As recently as February 1939, Frisch and Meitner had published in Nature their theoretical explanation of recent experiments, showing that the uranium nucleus could fission when bombarded by neutrons. But by 1940, Frisch and Peierls realized that the time for open publication of these matters had passed.> Similarly, at some point, the people doing detailed estimates of how many physical qubits and gates it’ll take to break actually deployed cryptosystems using Shor’s algorithm are going to stop publishing those estimates, if for no other reason than the risk of giving too much information to adversaries. Indeed, for all we know, that point may have been passed already. This is the clearest warning that I can offer in public right now about the urgency of migrating to post-quantum cryptosystems, a process that I’m grateful is already underway.Does anyone know how much underway it is?

          "content": "From analytical arguments considering a rather generic error type, we already know that for the Shor algorithm to produce a useful result, the error rate with the number of logical qubits needs to decrease as ~n^(-1/3), where `n` is the number of bits in the number [1].This estimate, however, assumes that interaction can be turned on between arbitrary two qubits. In practice, we can only do nearest-neighbour interactions on a square lattice, and we need to simulate the interaction between two arbitrary qubits by repeated application of SWAP gates, mangling the interaction through as in the 15th puzzle. This two-qubit simulation would add about `n` SWAP gates, which would then multiply the noise factor by the same factor, hence now we need an error rate for logical qubits on a square lattice to be around ~n^(-4/3)Now comes the error correction. The estimates are somewhat hard to make here, as they depend on the sensitivity of the readout mechanism, but for example let’s say a 10-bit number can be factored with a logical qubit error rate of 10^{-5}. Then we apply a surface code that scales exponentially, reducing the error rate by 10 times with 10 physical qubits, which we could express as ~1/10^{m/10}, where m is the number of physical qubits (which is rather optimistic). Putting in the numbers, it would follow that we need 40 physical qubits for a logical qubit, hence in total 400k physical qubits.That may sound reasonable, but then we made the assumption that while manipulating the individual physical qubits, decoherence for each individual qubit does not happen while they are waiting for their turn. This, in fact, scales poorly with the number of qubits on the chip because physical constraints limit the number of coaxial cables that can be attached, hence multiplexing of control signals and hence the waiting of the qubits is imminent. This waiting is even more pronounced in the quantum computer cluster proposals that tend to surface sometimes.[1]: https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11432-023-3961-3",

Anyone serious that is not trying to sell you QC will tell you that quantum systems become exponentially less stable the bigger they are and the longer they live. That is a fundamental physical truth. And since they're still struggling to do anything at all with a quantum computer, don't get your hopes up too much.",

          "content": "So in my view, the issues I think about now are:- Too few researchers, as in my area of quantum computing. I would state there is one other group that has any academic rigour, and is actually making significant and important progress. The two other groups are using non reproducible results for credit and funding for private companies. You have FAANG style companies also doing research, and the research that comes out still is clearly for funding. It doesn't stand up under scrutiny of method (there usually isn't one although that will soon change as I am in the process of producing a recipe to get to the point we are currently at which is as far as anyone is at) and repeatability.- Too little progress. Now this is due to the research focus being spread too thin. We have currently the classic digital (qubit) vs analogue (photonic) quantum computing fight, and even within each we have such broad variations of where to focus. Therefore each category is still really just at the start as we are going in so many different directions. We aren't pooling our resources and trying to make progress together. This is also where a lack of openness regarding results and methods harms us. Likewise a lack of automation. Most significant research is done by human hand, which means building on it at a different research facility often requires learning off the person who developed the method in person if possible or at worse, just developing a method again which is a waste of time. If we don't see the results, the funding won't be there. Obviously classical computing eventually found a use case and then it became useful for the public but I fear we may not get to that stage as we may take too long.As an aside, we may also get to the stage whereby, it is useful but only in a military/security setting. I have worked on a security project (I was not bound by any NDA surprisingly but I'm still wary) featuring a quantum setup, that could of sorts be comparable to a single board computer (say of an ESP32), although much larger. There is some value to it, and that particular project could be implemented into security right now (I do not believe it has or will, I believe it was viability) and isn't that far off. But that particular project has no other uses, outside of the military/security.",

      "abstract": "该帖子介绍了CineCLI，一款可在终端浏览电影信息并直接通过系统默认客户端打开种子链接的跨平台工具。核心话题围绕这一工具的功能、实用性和潜在法律风险展开讨论。\n\n社区反馈呈现多元观点。有人认为这本质上是对YTS API的封装，并质疑其目标用户群体，指出熟悉命令行工具的用户通常能获取更高质量的片源，而YTS的画质较差。也有用户指出其与Stremio加Torrentio插件的方案功能类似，但肯定其在Linux终端环境下直接使用的便利性，并提出了集成恶意文件检测、按时间戳流式传输等增强功能的建议。讨论中提到，由于工具本身不提供播放功能，可能在一定程度上规避法律风险，但若过于易用仍可能招致版权方警告。\n\n普遍认同的看法是，该项目作为一个无广告、无追踪的终端工具，其概念和实现受到了部分技术爱好者的欢迎。分歧主要集中于工具的实际价值、所用片源的质量以及其可能引发的版权问题。",

With this setup, i just turn it on, get to browse customized/recommended and random lists like in netflix and it streams directly via real-debrid or premiumizeOh; if you decide to have a dedicated raspberry pi for this thing (so you can use it with tv easilly), use a regular raspbian os or something, do NOT use libreelec.

The ambiguity involved can be in many different domains. It can be focused on product and tech, as in the article.

Employees are to be delegated to by BizOps, and BizOps doesn't like taking risks. It's paradoxical, because unless you come in with that authority or you were there extremely early, you're unlikely to acquire it, much more-so after the company's been around a few years.This seems to me where the term \"hired gun\" comes from. You pay someone who's incentivized to solve a discrete important problem with their expertise quickly, whereas all of your employees are incentivized to do things for amounts of time reliably over however long, answering to product managers, implementing whatever crap to get the sale, answering to useless managers every two weeks, planning, reviewing, retrospectiving, blah blah.

It is prudent to be very careful what sort of questions to ask that manager - \"what does that abbreviation stand for?\" is fine, \"what is the exact problem here and what do you want the solution to look like?\" or \"I don't understand, can you get into the details of why you think that?\" can be unexpectedly controversial.So there is a superpower in having zero shame in asking questions, but the real trick of it is being able to identify the set of inoffensive, basic questions that will move a project along. There is a large class of technically-reasonable-politically-imprudent questions that an inexperienced engineer might ask to their detriment.

          "content": "We are more than a decade away from knowing if Histosonics technology will actually be a meaningful treatment modality. It definitely is 'cool' in that there is no incision. However, whenever you deliver ultrasound energy from outside of the body, accuracy goes down; you are also limited by anatomy in the path of the ultrasound (e.g. going through the rib cage with ultrasound is not trivial). Folks I have spoken to who have bought these units say they are only allowed to use them if the tumor is superficial (i.e. near the skin). On top of that patient motion due to breathing definitely causes inaccuracies and complications. One doctor said it's an expensive paperweight (but it does bring patients in who ask for it).Also, the clinical efficacy is not fully understood. Researchers are most excited by an enhanced abscopal effect (i.e. natural immune response), but that's not a proven phenomenon. Finally, it is really expensive (~$1.5M) so it will be difficult to scale outside of research hospitals and cancer centers. Of course, I don't want to be too negative. It's a win for patients when they have more options.Full disclosure: I am co-founder of Current Surgical, where we are developing a  minimally invasive system based on miniaturized focused ultrasound to achieve precise thermal ablation (not cavitation). Our device can both see and destroy tissue from the same sensors, we can achieve millimeter accuracy. And because the technology can be integrated into any number of surgical tools (needle, catheter, etc) we can potentially reach any anatomy.",

It probably also helps that the liver is a much larger gland so aiming is less critical?",

You see everything.  The motion of the planets, the elliptic upon which they travel, the gradual shift of the entire field as the seasons change, the undulations of the moon and it's varied trajectory across the sky.  The shifting of the sun's set and rise and the ebb and flow of day vs night.  Everything.  Your mind just starts to harmonize with the rhythm of it all.  It's pretty wonderful.",

          "content": "I read this article back when I was learning the basics of transformers; the visualizations were really helpful. Although in retrospect knowing how a transformer works wasn't very useful at all in my day job applying LLMs, except as a sort of deep background for reassurance that I had some idea of how the big black box producing the tokens was put together, and to give me the mathematical basis for things like context size limitations etc.I would strongly caution anyone who thinks that they will be able to understand or explain LLM behavior better by studying the architecture closely. That is a trap. Big SotA models these days exhibit so much nontrivial emergent phenomena (in part due to the massive application of reinforcement learning techniques) that give them capabilities very few people expected to ever see when this architecture first arrived. Most of us confidently claimed even back in 2023 that, based on LLM architecture and training algorithms, LLMs would never be able to perform well on novel coding or mathematics tasks. We were wrong. That points towards some caution and humility about using network architecture alone to reason about how LLMs work and what they can do. You'd really need to be able to poke at the weights inside a big SotA model to even begin to answer those kinds of questions, but unfortunately that's only really possible if you're a \"mechanistic interpretability\" researcher at one of the major labs.Regardless, this is a nice article, and this stuff is worth learning because it's interesting for its own sake! Right now I'm actually spending some vacation time implementing a transformer in PyTorch just to refresh my memory of it all. It's a lot of fun! If anyone else wants to get started with that I would highly recommend Sebastian Raschka's book and youtube videos as way into the subject: https://github.com/rasbt/LLMs-from-scratch .Has anyone read TFA author Jay Alammar's book (published Oct 2024) and would they recommend it for a more up-to-date picture?",

Just simply more dimensions in a layer.And consequently, you can represent the entire transformer architecture with a set of deep layers as you unroll the matricies, with a lot of zeros for the multiplication pieces that are not needed.This is a fairly complex blog but it shows that its just all matrix multiplication all the way down. https://pytorch.org/blog/inside-the-matrix/.",

RL almost always, historically, assumes online training and interaction with an environment. RLHF is collecting data from user and using it to reach the LLM to be more engaging.This fine-tuning also doesn't magically transform LLMs into something different, but it is largely responsible for their sycophantic behavior. RLHF makes LLMs more pleasing to humans (and of course can be exploited to help move the needle on benchmarks).It's really unfortunate that people will throw away their knowledge of computing in order to maintain a belief that LLMs are something more than they are. LLMs are great, very useful, but they're not producing \"nontrivial emergent phenomena\". They're increasing trained a products to invoked increase engagement. I've found LLMs less useful in 2025 than in 2024.

It's like a disposable scratchpad to reduce the errors in the code it's about to write.The solution to comment spam is textual/AST post-processing of generated code, rather than prompting the LLM to handicap itself by not generating as much comments.",

I had this advice given directly to me years ago, in person, by Clem Delangue of Hugging Face - I took it seriously and really doubled down on understanding the guts of LLMs. I think it’s served me well.I’d give similar advice to any coding bootcamp grad: yes you can get far by just knowing python and React, but to reach the absolute peak of your potential and join the ranks of the very best in the world in your field, you’ll eventually want to dive deep into computer architecture and lower level languages.

          "content": "An example of why a basic understanding is helpful:A common sentiment on HN is that LLMs generate too many comments in code.For good reason -- comment sparsity improves code quality, due to the way causal transformers and positional encoding work. The model has learned that real, in-distribution code carries meaning in structure, naming, and control flow, not dense commentary. Fewer comments keep next-token prediction closer to the statistical shape of the code it was trained on.Comments aren’t a free scratchpad. They inject natural-language tokens into the context window, compete for attention, and bias generation toward explanation rather than implementation, increasing drift over longer spans.The solution to comment spam isn’t post-processing. It’s keeping generation in-distribution. Less commentary forces intent into the code itself, producing outputs that better match how code is written in the wild, and forcing the model into more realistic context avenues.",

Understanding how transformers work absolutely can help debug problems (or avoid them in the first place). People without a deep understanding of LLMs also tend to get fooled by them more frequently. When you have internalized the fact that LLMs are literally optimistized to trick you, you tend to be much more skeptical of the initial results (which results in better eval suites etc).Then there's people who actually do AI engineering. If you're working with local/open weights models or on the inference end of things you can't just play around with an API, you have a lot more control and observability into the model and should be making use of it.I still hold that the best test of an AI Engineer, at any level of the \"AI\" stack, is how well they understand speculative decoding.

Not sure what the historical reasons for lsof and ss are, but unix tools are structurally in a hard place when it comes to having sensible defaults over the long term.Generally speaking, you can only have sensible defaults over time if you're able to change the defaults over time. New users and new use-cases come with time, and so what constitutes a \"sensible default\" changes.However (and this is a drum I like to bang[0]), because unix tools only deal in usually-text bytestreams without any higher level of abstraction, consumers of those tools end up tightly coupled with how output is presented. Without any separation between data and its representation, the (default) representation is the tool's API. To change the default representation is to make a backwards-incompatible API change. A good example of this is how ps aux truncates longer than like 7 characters.[0] https://www.cgl.sh/blog/posts/sh.html",

But now if you want to create a file you do that.Intent: \"Print a file contents to screen\"\nCommand: \"cat $FILE\"Is this a reference to a feline? some slang for printing or reading? No it's short for concatenate, but if you pass just one argument instead of 2, it prints  the concatenation of 1 file and nothing.Even something as simple asIntent: \"Rename a file\"\nCommand: \"mv $FILE\"Of ocurse there's the fact that moving a file and renaming the file are very similar if not identical in most FS/OS, but also, the slight change from a word to a proper-name style command already creates a style of command line interaction that was very natural in the 80s, but is now being reinvented with the advent of more powerful language decoding technology. So even:Intent: \"Copy a file\"\nCommand: \"cp $FILE\"Now to the topic, you can see how my relationship with ss is the mapping:Intent: \"See a list of open ports\"\nCommand: \"ss -tulnp\"Which I remember mnmemotecnically because it is close to -tulip. This is similar to ps -aux in that the command includes a set of options and I remember it mnemotecnically (\"auxiliary\" or \"auxilio\"), and I use the options even when I don't need them, modifying the options from that baseline if needed, like removing \"a\" to get just the current user's processes.That said. I don't know if the future is going to be \"better\" alternatives to old tools, but rather deconstructing or making use of the concept of \"binary\":\"command\", running man and --help has never been an optimal solution, and let's be honest, kids nowadays are googling, stackoverflowing and chatgpting their intent in order to get a magical command.No easy way to improve upon this at the userspace level, the OS model of delegating control to binaries based on a hierarchical command structure is sensible, and \"magic\", or sharing commands across binaries without a clear ruleset would be too opaque. But I feel that creating new tools while barely revolutionizing the way they work is too small an incremental change, it adds more noise, I'm not sure that ss2 or network-manager instead of wpa_supplicant is a better outcome, now you are just linearly increasing the cognitive demand of new sysadmins linearly with time.Sorry to be a bummer.",

It should be the last option.Many LD_PRELOAD rootkits hide their activity from the system by manipulating the output of libc functions like readdir(), open(), stat(), etc.\nkernel rootkits can hide whatever they need, but the common functionality is also to hide data from /proc.That's why netstat, ps, *top or lsof are not reliable tools if the system is compromised. ss is  a bit different and is a bit more reliable.In this case, snitch is written in Go, which doesn't use the libc functions, so probably it'll be able to obtain information from /proc even if hidden by a LD_PRELOAD rootkit.Another option would be to compile the binary statically.Anyways, these tools are not meant to unhide malicious traffic or processes, so I think detecting beacons, inspecting traffic, etc, is out of the scope.Resources:https://github.com/gustavo-iniguez-goya/decloakerUser-space library rootkits revisited: Are user-space detection mechanisms futile? - https://arxiv.org html/2506.07827v1The Hidden Threat: Analysis of Linux Rootkit Techniques and Limitations of Current Detection Tools - https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3688808https://matheuzsecurity.github.io/hacking/bypass-userland-ho...https://ops.tips/blog/how-is-proc-able-to-list-pids/",

The major game engines Unreal and Unity are garbage collected - although they use manual memory management for some of their internals, the exposed API surface (including the C++ API) is designed with garbage collection in mind.Notably, the popular-with-hobbyists Godot Engine does not use a garbage collector. It uses reference counting with some objects, but does not provide cycle detection, thus requires all objects to be laid out in a tree structure (which the engine is built around).",

I fell deep down the rabbit hole of trying to get it to run on SteamOS.It's fascinating to see a commercial game whose source is easily read inside the application bundle, and all the modding opportunities it opens up.  (It's written in Lua with LÖVE.)  Balatro was one of the biggest games of last year, and I'm sure the tinkerability was a big catalyst to that - people porting it to obscure platforms and making mods to extend the game.It's also really cool to see how the game handles all the different ecosystems it exists in (Steam, Game Pass, Apple, Android, Nintendo Switch…).I've got a Nix derivation that ought to be able to run any version of the game in Linux.  Now I just need to figure out why it crashes when opened in game mode.All this is way more effort than just spending the $10 to get it to run in Steam natively, but it's more interesting this way.",

But LuaJIT is really just one guy’s project. Its metaprogramming features are really nice and let you build some Lisp-style DSLs, and if you want full Lisp syntax you can drop in Fennel. If you’re just writing extension code you often don’t need a standard lib because it’s easier just to roll your own function to fill the gap.Personally, I found it easier and quicker to just read the reference manual to learn the language.
