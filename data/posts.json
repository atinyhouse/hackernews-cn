Sending thank you from an ML model is anything but respectful. I can only imagine that if I got a message like that I’d be furious too.This reminds me a story from my mom’s work from years ago: the company she was working for announced salary increases to each worker individually. Some, like my mom, got a little bit more, but some got a monthly increase around 2 PLN (about $0.5). At that point, it feels like a slap in the face. A thank you from AI gives the same vibe.",

If you power your data centre with quality gas power plants you will emit 450g of CO₂ per kWh electricity consumed [2], that is 3.9 million tons per year for a GW data centre. So depending on power mix it will take somewhere around 200 GW of data centres for AI to \"catch up\" to aviation. I have a hard time finding any numbers on current consumption, but if you believe what the AI folks are saying we will get there soon enough [3].As for what your individual prompts contribute, it is impossible to get good numbers, and it will obviously vary wildly between types of prompts, choice of model and number of prompts. But I am fairly certain that someone whose job is prompting all day will generally spend several plane trips worth of CO₂.Now, if this new tool allowed us to do amazing new things, there might be a reasonable argument that it is worth some CO₂.

If anything, it's GitHub issues and PRs that are probably showing its cracks."

Linux systems commonly already provide (and heavily depend upon) a Python distribution which is perfectly suitable for creating virtual environments, and Python on Windows is provided by a traditional installer following the usual idioms for Windows end users. (To install uv on Windows I would be expected to use the PowerShell equivalent of a curl | sh trick; many people trying to learn to use Python on Windows have to be taught what cmd.exe is, never mind PowerShell.) If anything, new Python-on-Windows users are getting tripped up by the moving target of attempts to make it even easier (in part because of things Microsoft messed up when trying to coordinate with the CPython team; see for example https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58754860/cmd-opens-windo... when it originally happened in Python 3.7).> If I had a dollar for every time I've helped somebody untangle the mess of python environment libraries created by an undocumented mix of python delivered through the distributions package management versus native pip versus manually installed...Sure, but that has everything to do with not understanding (or caring about) virtual environments (which are fundamental, and used by uv under the hood because there is really no viable alternative), and nothing to do with getting Python in the first place. I also don't know what you mean about \"native pip\" here; it seems like you're conflating the Python installation process with the package installation process."

Walker spent about ten years researching this.  It is 700 pages, which seems daunting but he makes this authoritative bio absolutely enjoyable.  It's also a \"corrective biography\", it dispels a lot of myths.  This book is one of the best examples of accessible writing with flair.  What a writer!Throughout the book, Walker tastefully quotes musical phrases (in notation) from Chopin's works to situate them in context.  I often paused reading and put on the track on a given page (nocturnes, mazurkas, preludes, etc).  It made the reading experience incredibly rich and fun.  Other things I enjoyed: Chopin's letters to his friends and family, life in aristocratic salons of Paris, London, Warsaw, and more—Chopin had unparalleled access.  Of course, there's also a lot of gut-wrenching stuff.  As the book's blurb says, it really is for both the casual music lover and the professional pianist.If you haven't discovered them yet, give a listen to Chopin's nocturnes.  But please, give them an attentive listen and play them on a high-quality audio system.

          "content": "Technical followed by non-technical. I read more than these, but these are the highlights.Mouse, a Language for Microcomputers by Peter Grogono - Mouse is basically an esolang with barely any abstraction facilities, but the book was well-written and the language compelling enough to explore further.Notes on Distance Dialing (pdf) by AT&T - Described the telephone systems of the USA and Canada in the mid-1950s. The reading is a dry as it gets, but it was a fascinating dive into a vastly complex system solving extremely hard problems. This is a must-read for folks interested in systems-thinking. That said, I am actively looking for recommendations for books about the process of designing and building the unbelievably complex telephony system over the rudiments of the earlier systems. Recommendations welcomed!The Eye of Osiris by R. Austin Freeman - This is the first book that I’ve read from Freeman and I suspect that I will read many more in the future. The story follows the disappearance of John Bellingham, Egyptologist and the subsequent investigation. As the investigation stalls, the eminent Dr. Thorndyke digs into the case. The story sets up the mystery nicely and indeed provides enough information to the reader to infer how the disappearance occurred and who or what facilitated it. The book is one of the best whodunits that I’ve ever read.The Mystery of Edwin Drood by Charles Dickens - His final work remains unfinished as he passed away before he could complete it. Further complicating the meta-story is that he also didn’t outline the ending nor even put to paper the “villain” of the story. The meta-mystery of the ending has motivated a mountain of speculation around the ending including dozens of continuations of the story from other authors, all deriving their pet endings from textual hints, accounts from Dickens’ friends, illustration notes, and even in some cases seances supposedly accompanied by the spirit of Dickens himself. What was written by Dickens is spectacular and a compelling mystery and although it would be great to know the resolution, in some ways the “Droodiana” that has cropped up over the past 150+ years is reason enough for it to remain a mystery. The whole lore around Edwin Drood is a worthwhile hobby in itself and well-worth exploring. The Chiltern Library edition of the book contains the story and a good bit of the lore around the writing and the meta-works available at the time of its publication.The Shadow People by Margaret St. Clair - Sadly out of print and difficult to find, but I’ve had it on my shelves for decades and finally got around to reading it. The book came onto my radar in the 1980s when I learned about it in the appendix-n of the 1st edition Advanced D&D Dungeon Masters Guide. I enjoyed many of the books at the time and have slowly swung around to re-reading them over the past few years. Sadly, most on the list do not stand the test of time for me, but St. Clair’s mixture of 60s counter-cultural leanings in a fantasy/sf world still works. The cultural touch-points in the book feel quite dated, but despite the occasional awkwardness, the story is unique even today.Lolly Willowes by Sylvia Townsend Warner - The book started as a passable novel of manners focused on a turn of the century British middle-class family. The titular character was mostly background decoration for the first third of the novel and AFAIR was talked about only in the third-person. It’s only when she made the choice to move out on her own to the country in her middle age does she gain a central role in the narrative and her inner thoughts revealed. This is where things really pick up because I was shocked to learn that this unassuming woman’s inner thoughts had a delicious darkness to them. I don’t want to give away too much, but I’ll just say that you will not expect how the story ends.Patience by Daniel Clowes - A profound graphic novel using time-travel to explore the idea of enduring love with a story that proceed through time, following Jack as he tries to alter the past and save the woman he loves. This well-known science fiction motif is elevated by Clowes’ signature psychological complexity.Narcissus and Goldmund by Herman Hesse - I’ve read most of the books by Hermann Hesse but this one escaped my attention until this year. The story follows the parallel lives of a monk Narcissus and his passionate friend Goldmund as they respectively search for meaning in life through spiritual means and through pleasures of the flesh.We Who Are About To… by Joanna Russ - A small group of astronauts crash land on a hostile alien world and quickly realize that rescue is unlikely to come. Many SF stories have started this way and so the expectation is that this is a colonization story… but Russ thrives on subverting reader expectations.Fifty Forgotten Records by R.B. Russell - Another lovely entry in Russell’s series (one can hope) of autobiographical explorations of art, so far covering literature and now music. This book describes 50 records of varying popularity and Russell’s personal connections to each. While I certainly enjoyed finding a dozen or so new albums to explore, the true triumph of the book lies in the vulnerable, reflective memoir threaded throughout.The Way of All Flesh by Samuel Butler A novel that follows 4-generations of the Ponitifex family, with a particular bildungsroman-esque thread around Ernest, a young man who’s naivete leads to his downfall and how his life unfolds thereafter.I wrote about these (and more) at https://blog.fogus.me/2025/12/23/the-best-things-and-stuff-o...",

Maybe because I am quite jaded because job market sucks, and the job itself sucks (making the rich richer), and any extra time I need to do to advance my career is just doing leetcode monkey grind.I want to change it this year. I do CRUD apps, and I am very boxed in my br人工智能n, thinking that CRUD apps is the only programming there is. I often marveled at people who create database, compilers, emulators, 3D engines, version controls, text editors, etc. Those people are like wizards to me.I wonder how can I be creative like that? Like, how can you just wake up one day and decide to create magic.I want to learn how to do those. Any advice is appreciated.Also I want to do it in Zig because I've never worked with manual memory management language before, and I figured might as well."

Too much moisture the seed will rot or not have enough air to germinate. Too little moisture it won't trigger germination. Too deep it won't germinate, too shallow and germination won't happen either because it will dry out instead of staying moist. Seeds vary in depth they require and some even require light to germinate (doesn't apply to corn). It's a bit of an art figuring out what \"even moisture until germination\" is, and this varies based on soil type. Timing of planting with correct temperature is important.Each kernel of corn has one silk. The silk is analogous to a Fallopian tube with pollen traveling down into the ovary (or kernel of corn in this case). If you have an ear of corn with only a few kernels it's often because pollen didn't land on all the silks. For this reason corn is usually planted in blocks. It's wind pollinated so wind shakes pollen off the tassels or male flowers at the top, down onto the silk. But if you just have one corn plant in isolation, or a row in isolation it's easier for the pollen to just blow away or miss. Planting in blocks or \"array of arrays\" configuration helps the pollen to reach the silk more uniformly as pollen from the surrounding plants is released.",

If you have an ear of corn with only a few kernels it's often because pollen didn't land on all the silks. For this reason corn is usually planted in blocks. It's wind pollinated so wind shakes pollen off the tassels or male flowers at the top, down onto the silk. But if you just have one corn plant in isolation, or a row in isolation it's easier for the pollen to just blow away or miss. Planting in blocks or \"array of arrays\" configuration helps the pollen to reach the silk more uniformly as pollen from the surrounding plants is released."

We did it your way for so long, you had an almost complete full reign and look what happened -- now we all suffer from severely diminished physical and mental health, we hate our life and often our work, we know that we wasted our best years on pointlessly rebelling against things we could never change. Where did all that bring us? Please, work with me. I understand that you never feel heard because we never achieved the life you wanted. But I can't see any shortcuts. Do you?

Unfortunately sometimes the 25 year old burned CDs are missing the TOC data, but even the recovery process is satisfying.(Same with the DVD collections.)"

Unfortunately, that pattern looks so pretty that disney and ninetendo decided to use it as their generic mushroom coloring. So, if you are hiking with your kids, and they see a pretty mushroom just like in cartoons, don't let them touch it.If there are enough poisonous mushrooms, it is possible that most animals decide to leave mushrooms alone regardless of distinctive coloring. That seems to be the case because mushrooms tend not to be bitten by large animals, at least when i go mushrooming. If that happens, it is possible that other mushrooms do not develop poison but rather freeload on the poison of other mushrooms.Thus, one may guess, that first distinctive poisonous mushrooms like the fly agaric developed, then most animals large enough to eat them developed an instinct to avoid all mushrooms, and then the non-poisonous freeloading mushrooms developed.There are some psychedelic mushrooms in the amazon that use their psychedelic effect to zombify ants and force them to spread the mushrooms spores. That is really disturbing, find a youtube video of it if you feel like having some nightmares.Furthermore it should be noted that the poison or the psychedelic effect may not even be relevant for evolution. The poisonous or psychedelic compound may be produced for completely different purpose or as a byproduct of the production of another useful compound.",

Some feedback:  - Email delay to Gmail inboxes for verifying an SSH key used via SSH via email is longer than the timeout of the \"Waiting for verification email...\" stage in the SSH key registration. Wait longer or provide a non-email way to authorize a new key. You could imagine a few ways to do this: Allow users to add/delete SSH keys from the website or exe.dev shell; create a bearer token/random string that I can generate from the exe.dev shell or website to associate a new SSH key; SSH key signatures (existing key signs new key); SSH CAs (like @cert-authority); etc.\n  - SSH U2F/FIDO2 authentication support has become mainstream, and offers you a way to have homogeneous auth across web and SSH interfaces. Maybe consider unifying authN this way?\n  - exe.dev ssh interface does not allow me to list SSH keys, only to delete them. Consider moving all authN/authZ functionality into an \"auth\" subcommand/submenu (like you have for \"share\") and support SSH pubkey CRUD in there.\n  - You make some strong assumptions about email addresses that aren't true -- what happens on email address changes, lost email access, etc. This will become more important when you start billing (and possibly costly).\n  - How do I manage persistent disks? Any way to attach them to a different VM after I'm done with them on the original one? Is there always a single PD per VM or can these be managed separately? What about data or database volumes? Can PDs be attached to one or multiple VMs at a time?\n\nAt what scale do you break even on fixed costs (wages, rents, etc.)?",

Some feedback:  - Em人工智能l delay to Gm人工智能l inboxes for verifying an SSH key used via SSH via em人工智能l is longer than the timeout of the \"W人工智能ting for verification em人工智能l...\" stage in the SSH key registration. W人工智能t longer or provide a non-em人工智能l way to authorize a new key. You could imagine a few ways to do this: Allow users to add/delete SSH keys from the website or exe.dev shell; create a bearer token/random string that I can generate from the exe.dev shell or website to associate a new SSH key; SSH key signatures (existing key signs new key); SSH CAs (like @cert-authority); etc.\n  - SSH U2F/FIDO2 authentication support has become m人工智能nstream, and offers you a way to have homogeneous auth across web and SSH interfaces. Maybe consider unifying authN this way?\n  - exe.dev ssh interface does not allow me to list SSH keys, only to delete them. Consider moving all authN/authZ functionality into an \"auth\" subcommand/submenu (like you have for \"share\") and support SSH pubkey CRUD in there.\n  - You make some strong assumptions about em人工智能l addresses that aren't true -- what happens on em人工智能l address 变更, lost em人工智能l access, etc. This will become more important when you start billing (and possibly costly).\n  - How do I manage persistent disks? Any way to attach them to a different VM after I'm done with them on the original one? Is there always a single PD per VM or can these be managed separately? What about data or database volumes? Can PDs be attached to one or multiple VMs at a time?\n\nAt what scale do you break even on fixed costs (wages, rents, etc.)?"

But for individuals, it is a dead technology. I am reluctant to make everyone's exe.dev experience worse for legacy tech."

Can someone expl人工智能n why this dispute is worth having beyond a theoretical legal debate on whether they should hand out the particular source tree from which their kernel was built (if they even built it)?"

          "content": "Days since last ffmpeg CLI wrapper: 0It's incredible what lengths people go to to avoid memorizing basic ffmpeg usage. It's really not that hard, and the (F.) manual explains the basic concepts fairly well.Now, granted, ffmpeg's defaults (reencoding by default and only keeping one stream of each type unless otherwise specified) aren't great, which can create some footguns, but as long as you remember to pass `-c copy` by default you should be fine.Also, hiding those footguns is likely to create more harm than it fixes. Case in point: \"ff convert video.mkv to mp4\" (an extremely common usecase) maps to `ffmpeg -i video.mkv -y video.mp4` here, which does a full reencode (losing quality and wasting time) for what can usually just be a simple remux.Similarly, \"ffmpeg extract audio from video.mp4\" will unconditionally reencode the audio to mp3, again losing quality. The quality settings are also hardcoded and hidden from the user.I can sympathize with ffmpeg syntax looking complicated at first glance, but the main reason for this is just that multimedia is really complicated and that some of this complexity is necessary in order to not make stupid mistakes that lose quality or waste CPU resources. I truly believe that these ffmpeg wrappers that try to make it seem overly simple (at least when it's this simple, i.e. not even exposing quality settings or differentiating between reencoding and remuxing) are more hurtful than helpful. Not only can they give worse results, but by hiding this complexity from users they also give users the wrong ideas about how multimedia works. \"Abstractions\" like this are exactly how beliefs like \"resolution and quality are the same thing\" come to be. I believe the way to go should be educating users about video formats and proper ffmpeg usage (e.g. with good cheat sheets), not by hiding complexity that really should not be hidden.Edit: Reading through my comment again, I have to apologize for the slightly facetious opening statement, even if I quality it later on. The fact that so many ffmpeg wrappers exists is saying something about its apparent difficulty, but as I argue above, a) there are reasons for this (namely, multimedia itself just being complicated), and b) I believe there are good and bad ways to \"fix\" this, with oversimplified wrappers being more on the \"bad\" side.",

It's like something in between XMLDSIG (which pulls cryptographic control data out of random places in XML messages according to attacker-controlled tags) and SSL2 (with no coherent authentication of the complete handshake).The attack on detached signatures (attack #1) happens because GnuPG needs to run a complicated state machine that can put processing into multiple different modes, among them three different styles of message signature. In GPG, that whole state machine apparently collapses down to a binary check of \"did we see any data so that we'd need to verify a signature?\", and you can selectively flip that predicate back and forth by shoving different packets into message stream, even if you've already sent data that needs to be verified.The malleability bug (attack #4) is particularly slick. Again, it's an incoherent state machine issue. GPG can \"fail\" to process a packet because it's cryptographically invalid. But it can also fail because the message framing itself is corrupted. Those latter non-cryptographic failures are handled by aborting the processing of the message, putting GPG into an unexpected state where it's handling an error and \"forgetting\" to check the message authenticator. You can CBC-bitflip known headers to force GPG into processing DEFLATE compression, and mangle the message such that handling the message prints the plaintext in its output.The formfeed bug (#3) is downright weird. GnuPG has special handling for `\\f`; if it occurs at the end of a line, you can inject arbitrary unsigned data, because of GnuPG's handling of line truncation. Why is this even a feature?Some of these attacks look situational, but that's deceptive, because PGP is (especially in older jankier systems) used as an encryption backend for applications --- Mallory getting Alice to sign or encrypt something on her behalf is an extremely realistic threat model (it's the same threat model as most cryptographic attacks on secure cookies: the app automatically signs stuff for users).There is no reason for a message encryption system to have this kind of complexity. It's a deep architectural flaw in PGP. You want extremely simple, orthogonal features in the format, ideally treating everything as clearly length-delimited opaque binary blobs. Instead you get a Weird Machine, and talks like this one.Amazing work.",

That would really not be any friendlier than a binary file with a openly documented format and suitable editing tool, e.g. sqlite.Maybe a lack of fundamental technical skills is another culprit, but binary files really aren't that scary."

Standardization and simplicity are good, and so is requiring peer review of code before it's accepted for existing, production, big systems.Disallow editing trunk/main/master and whenever there's merge conflict between PRs, manual rebasing of one or the other is required. Not a huge deal.Also, have structured OWNERS files that include people and/or distribution list(s) of people who own/support stuff. Furthermore, have a USERS file that keeps lists of people who would be affected by restarting/interrupting/changing a particular codebase/service for notification purposes too.

Git, by itself, is too low-level for shared, mostly single-source-of-truth yet distributed dev.Make test cases all green locally before pushing, but not in a way that interferes with pushing code and they shouldn't be tied to a particular (D)VCS. Allow uploading all of the separate proposed PRs you want in a proposed \"for review\" state. After a PR is signed-off and sent for merging, it goes into a linearizing single source of truth backed by an automated testing/smoke testing process before they land \"auto-fast-forwarded\" in a mostly uncontrolled manner that doesn't allow editing the history directly. Standardization and simplicity are good, and so is requiring peer review of code before it's accepted for existing, production, big systems.Disallow editing trunk/m人工智能n/master and whenever there's merge conflict between PRs, manual rebasing of one or the other is required. Not a huge deal.Also, have structured OWNERS files that include people and/or distribution list(s) of people who own/support stuff. Furthermore, have a USERS file that keeps lists of people who would be affected by restarting/interrupting/changing a particular codebase/service for notification purposes too. In general, monorepo and allowing submitting code for any area by anyone are roughly good approaches."

This has created a big pool of Unreal developers, which, in turn, induces game studios to use Unreal. Unreal's threshold is US$1 million in sales.Apparently they opened things up a bit last year, but nobody noticed.Usefully, there is a QNX Board Support Package for the Raspberry PI, so you can target that.\nQNX would be good for IOT things on Raspberry PI machines, where you don't want the bloat and attack surface of a full Linux installation.[1] https://qnx.software/en/developers/get-started/getting-start...[2] https://www.theregister.com/2024/11/11/qnx_8_freeware/"

Personally identify a pain in your own work, and it most likely will be a pain for many others.2. Build a solution to solve for it.3. Organically talk about it in forums — for me this is Reddit, HN lately and to some extent Bluesky.When people ask why I build open source, I say it’s about signaling.

The Drop trait gets a &mut, but what we really want is to say \"destroy this value over there\". Rust's type system cannot understand that you own the value but not the place it lives in. What you need is an \"owned reference\" - i.e. &own, where the borrow checker knows that you can safely move out of it because it's going to get destroyed anyway.Rust also can't support constructors, for the same reason. What we really have are factory functions: you call them, they return a value, you put it somewhere. This is good enough that Rust users just treat factory functions as if they were constructors, but we can't do \"placement new\" type construction with them, or partial initialization. At least not in a way the type system can actually check.&pin is a first-class version of Pin<T>. Rust was originally designed under the assumption that any type can be memcpy'd at any time; but it turns out not being able to move types is actually super useful. Fortunately, it also turned out you could use smart pointers to pin types, which was 'good enough' for what it was being used for - async code.Actually, the blog post that coined \"inconceivable types\" was specifically talking about writing async functions without async. It turns out Future impls encode a lot of details Rust's type system can't handle - notably, self-borrows. If a value is borrowed across an await, what's the type of the variable that got borrowed from? It's really a negative type: borrowing T to get &T also turns T into !'a T that you can't access until 'a ends. Each borrowed reference is paired to a debt that needs to be paid back, and to do that you need lifetime variables and syntax to explicitly say \"pay back this debt by ending this borrow's lifetime\".How much of this complexity is actually needed is another question. There's a problem that each and every one of these reference types (or, anti-types) is intended to solve. Obviously if we added all of them, we'd overcomplicate the type system. But at the same time, the current Rust type system is already known to be oversimplified, to the point where we had to hack in pinning for async.

That would require a new Future trait with a different poll method signature, which the current Rust compiler doesn't know how to fill or desugar to. So you have to use the core Future trait and signature which doesn't support this kind of context borrow.To work around this limiation involves a lot of unnecessarily verbose code to drop and regain context between awaits, i.e. https://github.com/ruffle-rs/ruffle/blob/b5732b9783dce5d2311...",

This is useful for theoretical physics, where they're playing around with such groups and need representations they can do things with.- In information theory, the differential entropy (or average amount of bits it takes to describe a particular point in a continuous probability distribution) increases if you spread out the distribution, and decreases if you squeeze it together by exactly log |det M| for a linear transformation.
