      "abstract": "该讨论围绕“备份Spotify”展开，核心话题是数字媒体保存的重要性及安娜档案馆大规模抓取Spotify音乐数据引发的争议。多数用户认同数字内容易消失的问题，如链接失效、平台下架歌曲导致播放列表变灰，认为长期保存文化资料具有价值。\n\n讨论中提到，安娜档案馆此前以图书为主，此次涉足音乐可能面临更严厉的法律风险（如RIAA的追责）。有用户指出，此次抓取数据量巨大（约1.86亿条），堪比昔日的“亚历山大图书馆”What.CD，可能帮助找回已从主流平台同步删除的曲目。\n\n但观点存在分歧：有人认为此举对普通用户意义有限，因为Spotify本身便捷，且从庞大种子文件中定位单曲不便；也有用户强调，大规模破解Spotify DRM并公开下载令人震惊，可能引发版权争议。此外，有用户反映该网站在某些地区被网络提供商屏蔽，访问需借助VPN。整体上，社区虽肯定保存数字遗产的初衷，但对实践方式与法律后果看法不一。",

I wonder if I could find them in this archive.There is contemporary lost media being created every day because of how we distribute things now. I think in some cases, the intent of the publisher was to literally destroy every copy of the information. I understand the legal arguments for this, but from a spiritual perspective, this is one of the most offensive things I can imagine. Intentionally destroying all copies of a creative work is simply evil. I don't care how you frame it.Making media effectively lost is not much different in my mind. Is it available if it's sitting on a tape in an iron mountain bunker that no one will ever look at again?",

The only thing is, you can't really publicly admit exactly what dataset you trained/tested on...?Definitely wondering if this was in response to desire from AI researchers/companies who wanted this stuff.

There were also quite a few really old and niche records on there which possibly couldn't be put on streaming services due to the ownership of rights being unknown. It was the equivalent of vinyl crate digging without physical restrictions.Additionally there was a lot of discourse about music and a lot of curated discovery mechanisms I sorely miss to this day. An algorithm is no replacement for the amount of time and care people put into the web of similar artists, playlists of recommendations and reviews. Despite it being piracy, music consumption through it felt more purposeful. It's introduced me to some of my all time favourite artists, which I've seen live and own records and merchandise of.",

And for many movies you must buy/rent each individually. And legal TV and movies are much more encumbered by DRM and lock in, limiting the way you can view them. (like many streaming apps removing AirPlay support, or limiting you to 720p in some browsers)I think Spotify wins over pirating because of its relatively low cost and convenience. Pirating TV/Movies have increased as the cost to access them has.",

Even most Windows games work perfectly out of the box (often better than on Windows). Anyone who tried Linux in the past and wasn't happy, should take another look. These distros are so incredible it's hard to believe.Meanwhile Windows has been getting worse and worse. Completely unreasonable and unnecessary hardware requirements, spyware, constantly running antivirus and other processes you don't want, forced updates and reboots, shoving AI down your throat. In other words, you pay money to have a worse experience and less control over your own PC.I've been ideologically opposed to Windows for a while, but a few years ago Linux required many trade-offs and compromises, to the point I wouldn't have recommended to most people. But now things are completely different and I would happily recommend it to anyone except those who have a hard requirement for MS software (or Adobe).",

For instance, the lock screen had online feeds shown. The setting to disable them is on a remote website, not in the screensaver prefs or some other local system pref.

By the time Windows 95 came out around 10% of US users had internet access.It wasn't until 2001 that the US reached 50% of users having internet access.Without internet there wasn't really a good way to distribute updates to most users.As a developer in that era working at a company that made software for PCs and Macs it was great. It meant that the way most users would get our software was buying it on floppy disk (or later CD) from a retail software store like CompUSA or Egghead.We'd only make more money from someone who bought our software if that software made a good enough impression that they bought more of our software. We'd lose money if any software went out with enough bugs or a confusing enough interface or a poorly enough written manual that a lot of people made a lot of calls to our toll free tech support.This was great because it largely aligned what developers wanted to do (write a feature complete program with a great UI and no bugs) and what management wanted (happy users who do not call tech support).With internet giving us the ability to push updates at almost zero cost and as often as we want people who release incomplete programs early and add the missing parts in updates are going to outcompete people who don't release until the program is complete and nearly bug free.Once you get there it is not much of a leap to decide that what you are really selling is not software to do X but rather the service of providing software to do X.

My old one was over 10 years old, not worn out, but not upgradeable to Win 11. I had been thinking waiting one more year before the security updates to Win10 are out... But I bought in when the first stories hit of the DDR5 price rises - at that time there had 'only' been a doubling, now the price is a further 3x of what I paid a good month ago. I thought it might be a good time to buy given the machine was so old and component prices were going up, and might for a long time.\nBut yeah, performance improvements aren't what they used to. Part of the reason is that normal things were  already felt so fast on the old one ;-) But I did get a much better gfx cards allowing some games that were unplayable before, and I think the CPU upgrade was needed for that as well, and then you might as well overhaul the machine. I also went from 16 to 64 GB, and the 16 GB had been a bit too little for some things.",

It's been going on for decades, each release gets a little better, and a lot of that work is almost certainly the thankless boring stuff that is absolutely necessary to get Wine to be \"production ready\".I ran Haiku a bit on an old laptop, and I do actually like it. It's ridiculously fast and snappy (even beating Linux in some cases), and I really do wish them the best, but as of right now I don't think it's viable quite yet.

          "content": "I was driving across the east side of SF and hit a patch of lights that were out.The Waymo's were just going really slow through the intersection. It seemed that the \"light is out means 4-way stop\" dynamic caused them to go into ultra-timid mode. And of course the human drivers did the typical slow and roll, with decent interleaving.The result was that each Waymo took about 4x as long to get through the intersections. I saw one Waymo get bluffed out of its driving slot by cross traffic for perhaps 8 slots.This was coupled with the fact that the Waymos seemed to all be following the same route. I saw a line of about a dozen trying to turn left, which is the trickiest thing to navigate.And of course I saw one driver get pissed off and drive around a Waymo that was advancing slowly, with the predictable result that the Waymo stopped and lost three more slots through the intersection.On normal days, Waymos are much better at the 4-way stops than they used to be a few years back, by which I mean they are no longer dangerously timid. The Zoox (Amazon) cars are more like the Waymos used to be.I expect there will be some software tweaks that will improve this situation, both routing around self-induced congestion and reading and crossing streets with dead lights.Note that I didn't see any actually dead Waymos as others have reported here. I believe this is an extreme failsafe mode, and perhaps related to just too much weirdness for the software to handle.It would be interesting to see the internal post mortem.",

Evidently, a power outage is the reason I don't see the traffic light lit up. Also other drivers are going through the intersection one by one, as if they think the light is not working.\"It's not enough to just analyze the camera data and see neither green nor yellow nor red. Other things can cause that, like a burned out bulb, a sensor hardware problem, a visual obstruction (bird on a utility cable), or one of those louvers that makes the traffic light visible only from certain specific angles.Since the rules are different depending on whether the light is functioning or not, you really need to know the answer, but it seems hard to be confident.

Or wait out the temporary electricity failure?I believe the answer is far more complicated than it seems and in practice having the cars stay still might have been the safest option any of the parties could agree on (Waymo's office, the city traffic people, state regulators, etc).There are people thinking this stuff out and those cars can 100% pull over automatically but an explicit choice was made not to do so for safety.",

Some people get grumpy and lay on the horn as if to motivate those in front of them to fly through themselves.But many people do stop, observe, and proceed when it is both appropriate and safe.After awhile, it calms down substantially.  The local municipality rounds up enough stop signs to plant in the middle of the intersections that people seem to actually be learning what to do (as unlikely as that sounds).By day 2 or 3, it's still somewhat chaotic -- but it seems \"safe\" in that the majority of the people understand what to do (it's just stop sign -- it may be a stop sign at an amazingly-complex intersection, but it's still just a stop sign) and the flyers are infrequent-enough to look out for.By day 5 or 6, traffic flows more-or-less fine and it feels like the traffic lights were never necessary to begin with.  People stop.  They take turns.  They use their turn signals like their lives depend on it.  And the flyers apparently have flown off to somewhere else.

It definitely wasn't the normal day to day driving where you don't quite think consciously what you're doing.I understand that individual autonomous vehicles cannot be expected to be given the responsibility to make such a call and the safest thing to do for them is to have them stop.But I assumed there were still many human operators that would oversee the fleet and they could make the call that the traffic lights are all off",

Curious if Waymo has done a psychological study of how we start to think about the vehicles. I know many runners, for example, that’ll stride right into the crosswalk in front of a Waymo but wouldn’t dare to do that in front of other cars.

And they of course sound like writing (books and periodicals etc) rather than \"chat\": as other responders allude to, the fine-tuning or RL process for making them good at conversation was presumably quite different from what is used for most chatbots, and they're leaning very heavily into the pre-training texts. We don't have any living Victorians to RLHF on: we just have what they wrote.To go a little deeper on the idea of 19th-century \"chat\": I did a PhD on this period and yet I would be hard-pushed to tell you what actual 19th-century conversations were like. There are plenty of literary depictions of conversation from the 19th century of presumably varying levels of accuracy, but we don't really have great direct historical sources of everyday human conversations until sound recording technology got good in the 20th century. Even good 19th-century transcripts of actual human speech tend to be from formal things like court testimony or parliamentary speeches, not everyday interactions. The vast majority of human communication in the premodern past was the spoken word, and it's almost all invisible in the historical sources.Anyway, this is a really interesting project, and I'm looking forward to trying the models out myself!",

Releasing a new interactive AI model is indeed different in significant and practical ways from the status quo. Yes, there are already-released historical texts. The rational thing to do is weigh the impacts of introducing another thing.2. Some people have a tendency to say \"release everything\" as if open-source software is equivalent to open-weights models. They aren't. They are different enough to matter.3. Rhetorically, the quote across comes across as a pressure tactic. When I hear \"are you going to do this or not?\" I cringe.4. The quote above feels presumptive to me, as if the commenter is owed something from the history-llms project.5. People are rightfully bothered that Big Tech has vacuumed up public domain and even private information and turned it into a profit center. But we're talking about a university project with (let's be charitable) legitimate concerns about misuse.6. There seems to be a lack of curiosity in play. I'd much rather see people asking e.g. \"What factors are influencing your decision about publishing your underlying models?\"7. There are people who have locked-in a view that says AI-safety perspectives are categorically invalid. Accordingly, they have almost a knee-jerk reaction against even talk of \"let's think about the implications before we release this.\"8.

It’s not just Flock cams. It’s the data eng into these networks - 18 wheeler feed cams, flock cams, retail user nest cams, traffic cams, ISP data sales2. All in one hub, all searchable by your local PD and also the local PD across state lines who doesn’t like your abortion/marijuana/gun/whatever laws, and relying on:3. The PD to setup and maintain proper RBAC in a nationwide surveillance network that is 100%, for sure, no doubt about it (wait how did that Texas cop track the abortion into Indiana/Illinois…?), configured for least privilege.4. Or if the PD doesn’t want flock in town, they reinstall cameras against the ruling (Illinois iirc?) or just say “we have the feeds for the DoT cameras in/out of town and the truckers through town so might as well have control over it, PD!”Layer the above with the current trend in the US, and 2025 model Nissan uploading stop-by-stop geolocation and telematics to cloud (then, sold into flock?

The nice thing about the \"everyone has access\" case is that it forces the public to decide what they think is acceptable instead of making it some abstract thing that their brains aren't able to process correctly.People will happily stand under mounted surveillance cameras all day long, but the moment they actually see someone point a camera at them they consider that a hostile action. The surveillance camera is an abstract concept they don't understand.

The \"Monday morning excitement test\" doesn't account for the hedonic treadmill - even meaningful work becomes mundane once your brain adjusts to it.Also, many people are genuinely burnt out from overwork, not just existential malaise. When you're juggling demanding work, family responsibilities, and barely have time for basic self-care, the problem isn't finding your \"highest purpose\" - it's structural.That said, I agree that meaning matters. But meaning doesn't always come from work. Sometimes the healthiest thing is treating work as necessary fuel for a meaningful life outside of it - relationships, hobbies, community involvement.The \"go into politics\" solution is fascinating though. Zero-sum games as existential fulfillment feels counterintuitive.",

I would expect that the lab work was a much more concrete, achievable, and lasting good than anything that will come of engaging with zero-sum or negative-sum games.I also wonder about the \"now it's time to lift everyone else into abundance\" earlier in the article. I don't disagree that this is valuable, but it doesn't solve the existential \"why\", it just puts it off for a few decades until the poorest humans are as rich as wealthy Americans are now. \"What a problem to have!\" one might say, but literally that is the problem that the article is about, right? Going back to power-level everyone else doesn't actually solve the problem of what to do when someone reaches the level cap.Ultimately there is nothing that is obviously and provably more important than the individual reading or writing this, as there kinda was in previous eras. Some candidates include religion, panhuman expansion or thriving (Musk), building a successor entity or entities (Altman), and the State or politics (the OP).

Clinically, you could say. But in the end, every one of those depressive episodes were because something was not right in my life.Whether I acknowledged it or not, whether I even realized that there was a problem, once I figured the issues out and took the sometimes very painful and exhausting steps to sort them out, the depression faded away.Over time, I’ve become better at introspection to figure out what’s really bugging me, and also in recognizing a budding early depression as warning signs.",

Then decided I wanted to go into a high-caliber start-up because I was kind of burned-out and after a year I did. I work with brilliant people, building a product that democratizes investing in my small EU country and seeing a company grow again is fun. The problem is we lack excitedness and the feedback loop is bad so my motivation hasn't picked-up. What helped me is a new hire that brought some emotions and excitedness to the team.I have also been thinking of giving my notice for a while now, but I'm also struggling with finding a purpose so that part also hit me hard. I'm actually scared of leaving my job in case I find out it was the one thing that gave me purpose and I won't be able to find something better.Congrats on doing it, and please do send a message if you do find something that gives you more purpose, it will greatly help me.",

Years ago I watched this lecture by Sapolsky[0] and it really helped. Breaking down the different classifications is really helpful. The SSRIs always made me feel worse, and this (along with a lot of other research) helped make sense of it. A few years back I was diagnosed with ADHD and a psychologist friend encouraged me to give Adderall a try. It was the first time that medication \"worked\" and it really made a big difference in my life. The big reason why being that psychomotor retardation and anhedonia were my biggest symptoms. When coupled with an anxiety disorder it creates a strong negative feedback loop.But here's the thing: medication isn't the cure. For me it alleviates (not eliminates) symptoms but at the end of the day it still requires work from me to ensure I create a positive feedback loop and don't let myself fall into that destructive loop. This is all stuff I had to learn on my own and through reading and seeking out friends with people who are more experts in the area. That's where I think our care system fails.The best thing I can recommend to people is to be introspective. Each journey is personal, but whatever your issues are try to find the early warning signs. For me it can be little things like the dishes piling up or my desk getting messy (these seem you be common). Things like depression build up, so look for the signs. And most importantly, open up. This was the hardest for me and makes me feel demasculated and embarrassed much of the time. But I've also found it to help build stronger relationships with my partner and friends. That it helps open a door to communicate both ways. Maybe you open the door for you, but you also open a door many are too nervous to open themselves. It's worth the discomfort and gets easier with time. (Talking behind a handle is a great way to start too. So make alt accounts if you need to.

A few questions:1. How are you handling ISR vs full static generation? You mentioned migrating to generateStaticParams - did you pre-generate all email pages or use on-demand ISR?2. Did you hit any Vercel function limits with the email processing, or is everything cached aggressively enough that it doesn't matter?3. R2's free egress is a game-changer - are you using Cloudflare's image transformations or handling resizing client-side?The caching strategy here is the real MVP. Most people underestimate how far good caching with Next.js can take you before you need Redis or more complex infrastructure.",

R2的免费出口流量改变了游戏规则——您在使用Cloudflare的图像转换功能还是在客户端处理尺寸调整？这里的缓存策略才是真正的核心优势。大多数人低估了Next.js良好缓存方案的潜力，其实在需要Redis或更复杂基础设施之前，它能发挥巨大作用。"

It got millions of page views, tons of really amazing requests to collaborate on making more related data accessible, and even new Yahoo emails that no one else has allowed the public to see.Yesterday's DOJ drop resulted in this very spontaneous rag-tag team of friends coming to my place in SF and each making their own app in the \"Jmail\" Suite. Riley and I are pretty shocked by how versatile this parody style is for visualizing Epstein's 20 year digital footprint.It's been a ton of fun and we're working hard to polish each view here.",

I've been running Qwen2.5-Coder locally for the past month and the real bottleneck isn't cost - it's the iteration speed. Claude's 200k context window with instant responses lets me paste entire codebases and get architectural advice. Local models with 32k context force me to be more surgical about what I include.That said, the privacy argument is compelling for commercial projects. Running inference locally means no training data concerns, no rate limits during critical debugging sessions, and no dependency on external API uptime. We're building Prysm (analytics SaaS) and considered local models for our AI features, but the accuracy gap on complex multi-step reasoning was too large. We ended up with a hybrid: GPT-4o-mini for simple queries, GPT-4 for analysis, and potentially local models for PII-sensitive data processing.The TCO calculation should also factor in GPU depreciation and electricity costs. A 4090 pulling 450W at $0.15/kWh for 8 hours/day is ~$200/year just in power, plus ~$1600 amortized over 3 years. That's $733/year before you even start inferencing.

All three of these will let you live in a single coding cli but swap in different models for different tasks easily.- claude code router - basically allows you to swap in other models using the real claude code cli and set up some triggers for when to use which one (eg. plan mode use real claude, non plan or with keywords use glm)- opencode - this is what im mostly using now. similar to ccr but i find it a lot more reliable against alt models. thinking tasks go to claude, gemini, codex and lesser execution tasks go to glm 4.6 (on ceberas).- sub-agent mcp - Another cool way is to use an mcp (or a skill or custom /command) that runs another agent cli for certain tasks. The mcp approach is neat because then your thinker agent like claude can decide when to call the execution agents, when to call in another smart model for a review of it's own thinking, etc instead of it being explicit choice from you. So you end up with the mcp + an AGENTS.md that instructs it to aggressively use the sub-agent mcp when it's a basic execution task, review, ...I also find that with this setup just being able to tap in an alt model when one is stuck, or get review from an alt model can help keep things unstuck and moving.",

          "content": "The round-trip efficiency comparison (60-75% vs lithium-ion's ~90%) is interesting but somewhat misleading without context. For grid-scale storage, the relevant question isn't efficiency in isolation - it's lifecycle economics including capex, degradation, and replacement cycles.Lithium-ion has superior efficiency but degrades significantly after 5,000-7,000 cycles, typically reaching 80% capacity in 7-10 years. If CO2 batteries can maintain performance for 20+ years with minimal degradation (which the article suggests), the lower efficiency becomes less relevant. You're trading 15-25% energy loss for potentially 2-3x longer operational life and no lithium supply chain dependencies.The real breakthrough is duration-flexible storage. Lithium-ion economics break down beyond 4-hour discharge rates because you're paying for both energy capacity and power capacity. CO2 systems decouple these - the turbine size determines power output, the storage tank size determines duration. That makes them ideal for seasonal storage patterns where you might charge for days during high renewable production and discharge slowly over weeks during winter lulls.What's missing from the article: what's the round-trip efficiency at different discharge rates? Does efficiency drop significantly when discharging over 12 hours vs 4 hours?

Because any pressurized gas energy storage is either including some advanced heat storage or is just venting the heat created during compression (the ancient Huntorf facility in Germany is infamous for that, super wasteful)Usually you want to keep the heat and put it back into the compression medium during decompression and hope that losses from the heat storage aren't too big, but when you have a cooling use case nearby, you can use that low intensity heat to compensate heat storage losses, or even overcompensate. When you consider how much of the power input of a datacenter is typically used for cooling, compressed gas storage could be useful even if there was zero electric recovery (just time-shifting the power consumption for cooling to a time with better energy availability)",

On something like a paintball marker the burst disc (i.e. emergency blow off valve) for a CO2 tank is in the range of of 1500-1800PSI [0].A compressed air tank that has a 62cubic inch, 3000PSI capacity, will have a circumference of 29cm and a length close to 32.7cm, compared to a 20oz CO2 tank that has a circumfrence of 25.5cm and a length of around 26.5cm [1]. The 20oz tank also weighs about as much 'filled' as the Compressed air tank does empty (although compressed air doesn't weigh much, just being through here).And FWIW, that 62/3000 compressed air vs 20oz CO2 comparison... the 20oz of CO2 will almost certainly give you more 'work' for a full tank. When I was in the sport you needed more like a 68/4500 tank to get the same amount of use between fills.Due to CO2's lower pressures and overall behavior, it's way cheaper and easier to handle parts of this; I'm willing to bet the blowoff valve setup could in fact even direct back to the 'bag' in this case, since the bag can be designed pessimistically for the pressure of CO2 under the thermal conditions. [2]I think the biggest 'losses' will be in the energy around re-liquifying the CO2, but if the system is closed loop that's not gonna be that bad IMO. CO2's honestly a relatively easy and as long as working in open area or with a fume hood relatively safe gas to work with, so long as you understand thermal rules around liquid state [also 2] and use proper safety equipment (i.e. BOVs/burst discs/etc.)[0] - I know there are 3k PSI burst discs out there but I've never seen one that high on a paintball CO2 tank...[1] - I used the chart on this page as a reference: https://www.hkarmy.com/products/20oz-aluminum-co2-paintball-...[2] - Liquid CO2 does not like rapid thermal changes or sustained extreme heat; This is when burst discs tend to go off. But it also does not work nearly as well in cold weather, especially below freezing. Where this becomes an issue is when for one reason or another liquid CO2 gets into the system.

          "content": "To cite and expand on lambdaone below [1]:> Clearly power capacity cost (scaling compressors/expanders and related kit) and energy storage cost (scaling gasbags and storage vessels) are decoupled from one another in this designLambdaone is differentiating between the costs to store energy (measured in kWh or Joules) and the costs to store energy per time (which is power, measured in Watts). If you want to store the whole excess energy that solar panels and wind turbines generate on a sunny, windy day, you need to have a lot of power storage capability (gigawatts of power generated during peak power generation). This can be profitable even if you only have a low energy storage capability, e.g. if you can only store a day worth of excess solar/wind energy, because you can sell this energy in the short term, for example in the next night, when the data centers are still running, but solar panels don't produce power. This is what batteries give you -- high power storage capabilities but low energy storage capacities.Of course, you can always buy more batteries to increase the energy storage capacities, but they are very expensive per energy (kWh) stored. In contrast, these CO2 \"batteries\" are very cheap per energy (kWh) stored -- \"just\" build more high pressure tanks -- but expensive per power (Watts) stored, because to store more power, you need to build more expensive compressors, coolers etc. This ability to scale out the energy storage capability independently of the power storage capability is what Lambdaone was referring to with the decoupling.For what is this useful? For shifting energy over a larger amount of time. Because energy storage costs of batteries are so high, they are a bad fit for storing excess energy in the summer (lots of solar) and releasing it in the winter (lots of heating). I'm not sure if these \"CO2\" batteries are good for such long time frames (maybe pressure loss is too high), but the claim most certainly is that they can shift energy over a longer time frame than is possible with batteries in an economically profitable fashion.[1] https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46347251",

If we take \"a few\" to mean 3, then 3 GW × 3 day = 216 GW⋅h. I'm not sure there exists a large enough pumped hydro plant in the world that stores 216 GW⋅h of energy.

This is interesting because the tor project has put the most effort into fingerprinting resistance. If you care about privacy and you have a customized browser, you're likely uniquely finger printable [1]. If you don't want to connect via tor, there's no excuse not to use the mullvad browser. (Doesn't require you to use mullvad VPN; comes with the mullvad plugin, disabled by default, to optionally use mullvad encrypted DNS. Last point, I wrote to the tor project and asked \"is it possible to use tor browser minus tor network\", and they responded \"that's the mullvad browser\", so this isn't just my recommendation)[1] https://coveryourtracks.eff.org",

This used to be the business model. For online orders, they could purge everything after the return window passed. The order data shouldn’t be needed after that. For brick and mortar, it should be a very straightforward business. However, I’m routinely asked for my zip code or phone number when I check out at stores. Loyalty cards are also a way to incentivize customers to give up this data (https://xkcd.com/2006/).TVs are another big one. They are all “smart” now, and collect significant amounts of data. I don’t know anyone who would be upset with a simple screen that just let you change inputs and brightness settings, and let people plug stuff into it. Nothing needs to be collected or phone home.A lot of the logs that are collected in the name of troubleshooting and bug fixing exist because the products are over-complicated or not thoroughly tested before release. The ability to update things later lowers the bar for release and gives a pass for adding all this complexity that users don’t really want.

      "abstract": "该讨论围绕2014年文章《如果你不规划职业生涯，别人就会替你规划》展开，核心探讨职业发展是否应主动设计。有人认为主动规划至关重要，可借鉴汉明“目标导向”的比喻，避免像醉酒水手般随机漫步；也有用户指出，过度规划可能忽略偶然机遇的重要性，许多成功源于在机会出现时恰好能行动。讨论中提到，年轻一代面临职业路径碎片化的现实，传统规划方式已不适用；同时，部分用户将职业视为谋生手段而非人生重心，更追求工作与生活的分离。分歧集中在规划与机遇的平衡上：一方强调目标导向的主动性，另一方则认为灵活应对变化更为实际。共识在于，完全被动接受外界期望可能导致自我与现实的割裂，但具体实现方式存在代际和价值观差异。",

But if there is a pretty girl in one direction, then his steps will tend to go in that direction and he will go a distance proportional to n. In a lifetime of many, many independent choices, small and large, a career with a vision will get you a distance proportional to n, while no vision will get you only the distance sqrt(n). In a sense, the main difference between those who go far and those who do not is some people have a vision and others do not and therefore can only react to the current events as they happen.Just a tiny bit of bias towards a direction will get you very far very fast.I once modeled+visualised this with a bit of javascript[1] and it's quite surprising to see the huge difference from even a tiny multiplication factor on each random/probabilistic decision.[1] https://swizec.com/blog/your-career-needs-a-vision/",

There is a genuine value add when you’ve worked beyond the same white collar profession your entire working career.In other words, the problem in designing your life is that you’re almost always going to pick things you already know. Maybe that gets you to the peak of your current profession over twenty years…but maybe some other job is actually a lot more fulfilling to you.I’m not sure how to incorporate this into a young person’s real life experience, but I do think gap years, varied internships, volunteering, etc. are probably a good start.I recently listened to a podcast with a guy that wrote a book advocating that young people spend 4 years getting a pilot’s license, working on a ranch, becoming an EMT, and various other useful skills/jobs. That seems like a great idea, although I didn’t like the hostility to traditional college he had in offering this plan.",

          "content": "This advice remains relevant but I think it misses an important nuance about how career design actually works in practice. The metaphor of \"design\" implies you're building something from scratch with full control, but career development is more like gardening - you can influence conditions but not force outcomes.The key insight is recognizing the misalignment between your goals and your manager's goals. Your manager optimizes for team output and organizational needs. Your career growth is a secondary concern - important, but not primary. This creates a fundamental principal-agent problem. The solution isn't to become adversarial, it's to be explicit about your goals and negotiate actively rather than hoping they'll be noticed.Practically, this means: (1) Having quarterly conversations where you explicitly state \"I want to work on X technology\" or \"I'm aiming for senior by Q3\" rather than assuming good work will be rewarded automatically. (2) Building skills outside your job scope through side projects, open source, or internal tools that solve real problems. (3) Being willing to change companies when growth stalls - the biggest salary/title jumps come from job changes, not promotions.The dangerous flip side is over-optimization. I've seen engineers obsess over \"career design\" to the point where they won't touch any task that doesn't directly ladder to their promotion case. That creates fragile specialists who can't adapt when their niche technology becomes obsolete. Better approach: have a direction, but maintain broad skills and genuine curiosity. The most interesting career paths come from unexpected opportunities you recognized because you had wide exposure, not rigid planning.",

What they need is MONEY; which is the ability to obtain the options which exist. And the only way to give people more money is through political means. This is why I was interested in crypto; it seemed to get straight to the point...I later quit crypto due to too much corruption in the space and launched a mainstream startup with a co-founder centered around helping people find 'the perfect job' but I quit as co-founder because the idea of it almost makes me want to vomit now.The system is firing people en masse. The system itself doesn't want people to have jobs... So me, trying to work against the system by offering a solution that operates within the system feels futile and like gaslighting users and myself. It's selling a dream. There is no perfect job. Reality is our socio-economic system doesn't even have a shitty job for you... Let alone a perfect job... And most jobs seem like bullshit jobs anyway.It's extremely hard to find an idea that's both truly useful and profitable these days. That's a shame because that's exactly what I want to do with my life but I feel like this does not align with what is possible within the current system. I cannot find any such opportunities in the tech sector.Someone told me I should get into politics but again if I think about what the typical politician does, I feel nauseous. The only kind of politician I could possibly be is the honest kind that gets assassinated... And of course I don't want that. Besides, nobody would fund me...

The film carefully depicts his efforts to reconcile his love for scientific exploration with the knowledge that his work is being used for destructive purposes.I have a similar short story idea where a person of the calibre of Elon Musk who works so hard is made to feel and see his successful moonshot projects being used for destroying and subjugating nations. This would be similar to Oppenheimer. Another twist I can take with the story is Hero \"Elon\" knows about this outcome but still in the hope of change in institutional ideology over decades hopes for better use for his technology. In the movie Watchmen, Ozymandias feels the pain of millions he is going to kill to save future billions.Watchmen: Killing millions to save billionshttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tu2DdkOxLNs",

They create a 'wow' factor by removing complexity; also removing flexibility... Targeting a specific psychological bias...

Just because you are a good developer doesn’t mean that you have the skills to lead other developers.  That’s the entire point behind the “Peter Principle”.  You have to show you are capable of working at the next level by working at the next level.I’m not saying you shouldn’t make more money if you bring more value to a company than do done else at your level.  But how is a company suppose to objectively manage that? You pulled more stories off the board? You had less QA defects?For what it’s worth, I flew to close to the sun myself about a decade ago and realized I would suck as a manager of people.  But I was getting better at leading projects.

      "abstract": "该帖子讨论了新兴编程语言Rue的定位，其目标是成为比Rust更高级、比Go更低级的语言。核心话题围绕Rue如何实现内存安全而不依赖垃圾回收或手动内存管理，目前这仍是进行中的设计。\n\n社区观点多元：有人认为内存管理方案尚不明确，缺乏详细解释，因此持观望态度；也有用户指出其设计提案包含多种类型模式，并采用类似Swift的inout参数传递机制，而非Rust的借用系统。讨论中提到，部分Go开发者希望有比Go表达力更强、且能兼容Go编译模型和库的语言，而一些受困于Rust生命周期复杂性的用户则期待更面向对象的替代方案。此外，有用户关注语法细节（如->符号的直观性），并建议参考博客和代码库以获取更全面的介绍。\n\n目前共识是Rue仍处于早期阶段，尚未准备好投入实际使用。主要分歧在于对其内存管理实现方式的不同猜测（如基于ARC、所有权或其他创新机制），以及它能否在表达力、安全性和易用性之间找到平衡点。",

A work in progress, though.\"I wish them the best, but until they have a better story here I'm not particularly interested.Much of the complexity in Rust vs simplicity in Go really does come down to this part of the design space.Rust has only succeeded in making a Memory Safe Language without garbage collection via significant complexity (that was a trade-off). No one really knows a sane way to do it otherwise, unless you also want to drop the general-purpose systems programming language requirement.I'll be Very Interested if they find a new unexplored point in the design space, but at the moment I remain skeptical.Folks like to mention Ada. In my understanding, Ada is not memory safe by contemporary definitions. So, this requires relaxing the definition. Zig goes in this direction: \"let's make it as safe as possible without being an absolutist\"",

Instead, of borrowing, you have an inout parameter passing convention, like Swift. Struct fields cannot be inout, so you can't store borrowed references on the heap.I'm very interested in seeing how this works in practice--especially given who is developing Rue. It seems like Rust spends a lot of work enabling the borrow checker to be quite general for C/C++-like usage. E.g. you can store a borrowed reference to a struct on the stack into the heap if you use lifetime annotations to make clear the heap object does not outlive the stack frame. On the other hand it seems like a lot of the pain points with Rust in practice are not the lifetime annotations, but borrowing different parts of the same object, or multiple borrows in functions further down the call stack, etc.",

          "content": "I have mostly been writing Rust in the last 10 years, but recently (1 year) I have been writing Go as well as Rust.The typical Go story is to use a bunch of auto generation, so a small change quickly blows up as all of the auto generate code is checked into git. Like easily a 20x blowup.Rust on the other hand probably does much more such code generation (build.rs for stuff like bindgen, macros for stuff like serde, and monomorphized generics for basically everything). But all of this code is never checked into git (with the exception of some build.rs tools which can be configured to run as commands as well), or at least 99% of the time it's not.This difference has impact on the developer story. In go land, you need to manually invoke the auto generator and it's easy to forget until CI reminds you. The auto generator is usually quite slow, and probably has much less caching smartness than the Rust people have figured out.In Rust land, the auto generation can, worst case, run at every build, best case the many cache systems take care of it (cargo level, rustc level). But still, everyone who does a git pull has to re-run this, while with the auto generation one can theoretically only have the folks run it who actually made changes that changed the auto generated code, everyone else gets it via git pull.So in Go, your IDE is ready to go immediately after git pull and doesn't have to compile a tree of hundreds of dependencies. Go IDEs and compilers are so fast, it's almost like cheating from Rust POV. Rust IDEs are not as fast at all even if everything is cached, and in the worst case you have to wait a long long time.On the other hand, these auto generation tools in Go are only somewhat standardized, you don't have a central tool that takes care of things (or at least I'm not aware of it). In Rust land, cargo creates some level of standardization.You can always look at the auto generated Go code and understand it, while Rust's auto generated code usually is not IDE inspectable and needs special tools for access (except for the build.rs generated stuff which is usually put inside the target directory).I wonder how a language that is designed from scratch would approach auto generation.",

The key differentiator seems to be \"zero-cost exceptions\" which I assume means compile-time Result types without runtime unwinding overhead? That's compelling if true, since Rust's Result ergonomics can get verbose in deeply nested error chains.But the real test is compile times and cognitive overhead. Rust's borrow checker is theoretically elegant but practically brutal when you're learning or debugging. If Rue can achieve memory safety without lifetime annotations everywhere, that's genuinely valuable. However, I'm skeptical - you can't eliminate tradeoffs, only move them around. If there's no borrow checker, what prevents use-after-free? If there's garbage collection, why claim \"lower level than Go\"?The other critical factor is ecosystem maturity. Rust's pain is partially justified by its incredible crate ecosystem - tokio, serde, axum, etc. A new language needs either (1) seamless C FFI to bootstrap libraries, (2) a killer feature so valuable that people rewrite everything, or (3) 5+ years for the ecosystem to develop. Which path is Rue taking?I'd love to see real-world benchmarks on: compile time for a 50k line project, memory usage of a long-running web server compared to Rust/Go, and cold start latency for CLI tools. Those metrics matter more than theoretical performance claims.

With Cargo, I couldn't figure out how to do this. In test mode, it would still try to build it as a dylib.Later, well, the reason that rustc has to layer a build system on top of Cargo: bootstrapping.

The level of abstraction is the number of implementations that are accepted for a particular interface (which includes not only the contract of the interface expressed in the type system, but also informally in the documentation). E.g. \"round\" is a higher abstraction than \"red and round\" because the set of round things is larger than the set of red and round things. It is often untyped languages that offer the highest level of abstraction, while a sophisticated type system narrows abstraction (it reduces the number of accepted implementations of an interface). That's not to say that higher abstraction is always better - although it does have practical consequences, explained in the next paragraph - but the word \"abstraction\" does mean something specific, certainly more specific than \"describing things\".How the level of abstraction is felt is by considering how many changes to client code (the user of an interface) is required when making a change to the implementation. Languages that are \"closer to the underlying machine\" - especially as far as memory management goes - generally have lower abstraction than languages that are less explicit about memory management. A local change to how a subroutine manages memory typically requires more changes to the client - i.e. the language offers a lower abstraction - in a language that's \"closer to the metal\", whether the language has a rich type system like Rust or a simpler type system like C, than a language that is farther away.",

Perhaps it's because most people haven't had writing a TCP stack as part of their day job, but it's such a fundamental technology I would have thought learning about it in depth would be suggested far more frequently.Also, a proper first edition copy is really high quality with lovely thick paper. My copy of Volume 2 on the other hand is not of the same quality, both in content and physical properties.",

A book mentioned once in passing (\"oh yeah, like in [book]\") carries very different weight than a book recommended explicitly (\"you should read [book] if you want to understand X\"). Are you parsing comment sentiment or just doing keyword extraction?The real value would be in clustering books by topic and showing which ones appear together in discussions. If someone mentions \"Designing Data-Intensive Applications\" and \"Database Internals\" in the same comment, that's a stronger signal than two isolated mentions. You could build a recommendation engine from that co-occurrence data.Also curious about the temporal aspect - tracking which books surge during certain news cycles. For example, did \"Chip War\" mentions spike when the AI compute restrictions hit? That contextual analysis would make this way more useful than a static ranked list. Would definitely use this if it had those features.",

What other people, real or imaginary, do and think and feel – or have done and thought and felt; or might do and think and feel – is an essential guide to our understanding of what we ourselves are and may become… A person who had never listened to nor read a tale or myth or parable or story, would remain ignorant of his own emotional and spiritual heights and depths, would not know quite fully what it is to be human. For the story – from Rumpelstiltskin to War and Peace – is one of the basic tools invented by the mind of man, for the purpose of gaining understanding. There have been great societies that did not use the wheel, but there have been no societies that did not tell stories.”Engaging with fantasy and scifi helps us understand ourselves and the world around us.

          "content": "What Le Guin is expressing is a beautiful idea, but it is a false beauty. It feels like truth because it aligns with how narrative engages the human mind, not because it accurately explains what stories are or why they exist. The sense that fiction reveals destiny, inner depth, or essential humanity is an illusion created by evolved cognitive machinery, not evidence of genuine insight.From an evolutionary and cognitive standpoint, imaginative fiction is not a privileged tool for understanding who we are. It is a byproduct of more basic adaptations. The human brain evolved as a prediction engine optimized for survival in social groups. Its primary function is to anticipate outcomes, model other agents, and reduce uncertainty well enough to reproduce. Narrative arises because the brain naturally organizes experience into causal sequences involving agents, not because stories convey deeper truths about the self.Fiction works by hijacking the same neural systems used for social reasoning, memory, and planning. When reading a story, the mind runs simulations of social situations. This feels like insight, but feeling insight is not the same as acquiring accurate models of reality. Fantasy and science fiction are not special forms of wisdom. They are simply inputs that exaggerate certain variables, making simulations emotionally vivid rather than epistemically reliable.Le Guin’s claim that someone without stories would be ignorant of their emotional or spiritual depths is not supported by biology. Emotions are not learned through narrative. They are innate regulatory systems shaped by natural selection. Fear, attachment, anger, desire, and joy exist prior to language and independently of story exposure. Stories can name, frame, or intensify these states, but they do not create or deepen them in any fundamental sense.The universality of storytelling also does not imply that it is an adaptive route to understanding. Evolution does not favor truth or self knowledge. It favors fitness. Many of the most persistent stories humans tell are systematically false. Myths, religious narratives, romantic ideals, and national legends endure because they exploit cognitive biases like agency detection, pattern completion, and emotional salience. Their spread demonstrates susceptibility, not insight.Fantasy and science fiction do not teach us to imagine better worlds. They teach us to imagine compelling ones. A narrative can feel profound while being completely disconnected from reality. Inspiration and accuracy are orthogonal. The persuasive power of stories comes from their alignment with evolved psychological vulnerabilities, not from their correspondence with truth.So the correct technical framing is this. Stories are not tools invented to gain understanding of humanity or destiny. They are artifacts produced by brains shaped for survival under uncertainty. They can be pleasurable, motivating, or culturally stabilizing. They can sometimes illuminate patterns of behavior. But their beauty should not be confused with truth. The feeling of depth they produce is an illusion, not a discovery.",

You get accurate transformations that can be quite complex and deep reworks to the code itself.A simple example would be transforming a foreach loop into a for loop, or transforming and optimizing linq statements.And yet we find these tools unused with agentic find/replace doing the heavy lifting instead.Whichever AI company solves LSP and compiler based deep refactoring will see their utility shoot through the roof for working with large codebases.",

He was making the two-hour commute to New York City, where he worked at the investment­ banking firm of Drexel Firestone. The train would have provided a more comfortable and faster ride; but, for those very reasons, it also offered more opportunity to meet other Wall Street acquaintances. They would want to engage in the kind of idle small talk that commuters share to pass the time. The thought must have been intolerable. He did not wish to be rude, but he wanted no interrup­tion.As soon as he had settled into his seat, being sure to take one with an empty one adjacent, he unloaded a mountain of prospectuses and 10ks (annual Securities and Exchange Commission filings) onto the seat next to him. On winter mornings the sky was still pitch black and the light on the bus was too dim for him to be able to read. He wore a leather aviation cap with the earflaps down; he had been bald for years, and although he wore a toupee his head always felt cold on these frosty mornings. Now over his aviation cap he fitted a miner's headlamp -- strapped around the back of his head, with a huge light projecting from his forehead.",

This is very different from \"fast\", which it has also become! When I started working from the train (on HSPA+), pings in the hundreds of milliseconds were the norm. My first step was usually to SSH to a remote machine, and let just the text lag on me. Nowadays, I can run a Web browser locally without issue.2. Cell service has, at the same time, become ubiquitous in subway tunnels. When I started, there were some areas that dropped down to EDGE (unusable), and some areas that had no service at all. Now, there is exactly one place on the Boston transit system - Back Bay Station - where I lose cell service.3. Noise cancelling tech has gotten better. It's not just about noise cancelling headphones: both of my laptops (a 2024 MBP and a ThinkPad P14s) have microphones that can filter out screeching wheels and noisy teenagers quite well. That means I can take meetings without making them miserable for the people on the other end.These, honestly, are a huge game-changer for me.

I think they were before the Tecras), heavy and the battery life wasn’t much more than 90 minutes but it was just enough. Dual booting Windows and Linux. (Linux for dev work on the go…)Obviously no mobile connectivity back then, I had to have a plan for what I was going to work on and that also involved backup plans if I ran into a blocker on the primary. Same for the way home.A bit later I could get GPRS data rates via Infra-Red to my mobile and that just felt like magic.I found the times I couldn’t be on my laptop (walking or on the packed train) were great for thinking problems through and often had to stop to scribble down thoughts/ideas/solutions in a notebook that I kept in the laptop bag.Wrote so much useful code in that 18 months without the distractions of the Internet or emails or whatever.Now I somehow find I have less time despite having virtually no commute.

It ran in 15 minutes while I played Kirby Air Riders and worked on the first try.Afterward, I sort of had to reflect on the fact that I learned essentially nothing about building vector search.

I love the phase one and most of the time don’t have time and energy to sit down and go through the phase 2. Nowadays, I feel like the 2 phases are combined, thanks to LLMs. For instance, I wanted to do some animation for visualizations. This week, I learned AnimeJS by watching CCAgent create the animation I wanted, which was interspersed with questions that were answered with diagrams and text, which accomplishes the phase 1. I do not like letting them run the show. Then comes phase 2, where I organize the code, abstract things, rewrite code, still use their  help for long rewrites, but totally my ideas and mine only.

You can care about the parts you want to care about and not sweat about the parts you don't want to learn in detail (yet). And Claude and codex make great guides/Sherpas.There are just too many parts involved to do anything. For example today I built a simple data collection app to use on my phone that involves inventories with photos for a tedious workflow I have to do. I knew what I wanted but didn't know how to even choose which tools to bother learn. And just even trying things to see if an approach works or not without spending hours learning one thing or another or wading through the hell of web search is really great.Things I learned today that I figure everyone else must know: if you want to take a photo from a webapp I guess you need https. So I decided to try mTLS (knew it existed but never had the time) so asked Claude to write me a short tutorial about setting it up, creating keys, importing them (including a cool single line trick of spinning up a python server and downloading the keys on my phone rather than find a USB stick or whatever). And then helping me figure out a path out of the suffering of Chrome and Firefox hating self-signed CA. But at least I figured out how to make Firefox happy. But it would insist on prompting me for the certificate for every htmx request. But chatting with Claude I learn caddy is pretty cool, it's go. Claude suggests an auth boxcar when I balk at adding auth and user management to my app because I think the webserver should handle all this shit (wtf is a boxcar? Claude clues me in). I tell Claude to use go or rust to build the boxcar because Jesus Christ \"yay\" build another service just to get a good damn customized CRUD app on my phone that can take a picture. Claude picks go which is fine by me. (Incidentally I can't write go, but I can read it and it's on my \"to be learned\" agenda and go seems safer than a pile of python for this simple thing) The boxcar was fine but Claude was struggling with getting headers to work in the caddy config. So while Claude is working on that I do a quick Google about whether caddy can have extensions because there has to be a better way to \"if someone has authenticated successfully, give them a cookie that will last an hour so they don't have to mash the confirm about using the certificate for every goddamn htmx request\" than spin up a web service. Interrupt Claude and suggest an extension instead of a boxcar. Claude's on board so we ditch the boxcar. Have Claude and codex evaluate the extension for security. They find important issues about things a jerk might do, fix them. So successful mTLS connections transition to session cookies. So my dumb CRUD tool doesn't have to worry about auth. Which it didn't have to do anyway except browsers say so etc because my phone is literally only able to access the server via VPN anyway.Other things I have learned today that only wasted 5min of Claude's time rather than hours of mine: Firefox camera access can't control flash, focus or zoom. So call out to the native app instead.This is all quite fun and the tool I'm building is going to really make my own life better.Is there a better way to do this: probably.",

I also did some clustering, and learned something of how awkward it is in practice to pick a representative vector for a cluster - and in fact you may want several.I now know what the model does (at a black box level) and how all the parts fit together.

The machine itself has a notice saying not to go over 3 mins for the first week.I was following the protocol from this paper, which started people at 2 mins and used low wattage UVB-heavy bulbs.Sunbeds with UVB radiation can produce physiological levels of serum 25-Hydroxyvitamin D in healthy volunteershttps://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5821157/Unfortunately the Science Advances paper being discussed is epidemiological and doesn't distinguish between the type of bulb, length of time, and other parameters used while tanning. However it is safe to say that the average tanner cares more about getting dark than anything else.I think there would actually be a market for vitamin D centered \"healthy tanning\" where only low wattage, high-UVB bulbs are used particularly in cloudy areas or where the winter is long.

Meanwhile vitamin D supplements cost $10/year and achieve the same health benefit people claim to seek from tanning.The only rational argument I've heard for controlled UV exposure is building a base tan before vacation to prevent burning.

If you only tan in a strong tanning bed for 10 min (or 15 min in a weaker one), it's equivalent to only about an hour in the real sun around noon. I.e. if you've only been going to a tanning bed, you'll start to burn outdoors shortly after that. (And I'm talking about high-UVB bulbs that develop the long-lasting tan that protects against sunburn, just like the sun itself generates.)So the difference factor is more like 4-6x, not 10-15x. Honestly, 15x would be insane. Tanning beds aren't as strong as some fearmongerers suggest. And that's assuming full-body exposure.When you say you artificially tan at home for 1 minute, how?

Also, I think it is a dynamic process, so even cells the immune system hasn't killed yet could be found later. Or the mutation could cause other deviancies that will make the cell uncompetitive with healthy cells. But it is a slow process - it takes years for former smokers' lung cancer risk to return to near that of never smokers. And it probably never gets there - some mutated cells may never be detectable and there's clearly also a threshold beyond which the cancer is irreversible, at least without intervention.",

Since she was a fashion icon, this made the tanned look fashionable.As an aside, the chemistry behind UV damage is interesting. You can think of DNA as a sequence of four letters: C, G, A, and T. If there are two neighboring T's, UV can move a bond, linking the two T's together (i.e. thymine dimerization). If you're in the sun, each skin cell gets 50-100 of these pairs created per second. Enzymes usually fix these errors, but sometimes the errors will cause problems during DNA replication and you can end up with mutations. Enough of the wrong mutations can cause skin cancer.

          "content": "You might be interested in the British history of Vitamin D supplementation. It all started with kids in the cities getting rickets because the pollution (smog) was that bad that they never got to see further than a metre or two during the worst of it. The way to get around was by taking the tram as that had rails to guide it through the 'pea soupers'.So they put the kids on trains and took them off to the seaside.But then...The railway also allowed milk to be brought into the cities. So they added vitamin D to milk. That was how the rickets was solved. In time milk became free at school, usually it was warm by morning break, which was when it would get consumed, from mini-milk bottles, that would get reused.I am only piecing together this history, no definitive source, unless you include my elderly neighbour. However, food history is fascinating, once you get away from celebrated brands to the unsung heroes of the vegetable aisle.What I can't work out is why the children were so vulnerable to rickets when the adults weren't. Workers weren't being sent out to the countryside or beach to get some sun, just the kids. Rickets doesn't affect adults with grown bones, in theory, the adults should have had really painful joints and osteoporosis, but maybe this was not understood at the time.In time the clean air zones were setup and the smog was banished to a certain extent, by which time it became uncommon to fortify milk with vitamin D. Finally we had Margaret Thatcher, famously the 'milk snatcher', for stopping free school milk.In the UK we do get vitamin D randomly added to processed foods (what else?) and this is a scattergun approach to fortifying the population. If you don't eat processed foods then you are not going to get any of that processed food fortification goodness.Then there are the animal corpse sources, as in oily fish and whatnot. If you eat any diet except for whole-food-plant-based vegan, then you are going to get vitamin D either through dead animal or fortification. Vegetarians just have to eat maaassivve blocks of cheese, which they will, with a few eggs and some breakfast cereal to get their vitamin D needs roughly covered. Junk-food vegans should get some vitamin D goodness from fortifications too, particularly if they consume things like 'oat milk' (as if oats have mammary glands). Pure junk food, a.k.a. 'Standard American Diet', should also be pretty good for vitamin D.So this only really leaves the whole-food, plant-based, everything-cooked-from-scratch vegan diet as lacking, at least as far as the winter months is concerned. Was this a problem historically? I don't think so. Since people used to work the fields, they had plenty of vitamin D to carry over for winter.Before we had 'modern day racism' in the UK, we had a situation where the aristocracy had white skin and everyone else had leathery brown skin, from working outside. White skin was proof that you didn't have to work the fields and therefore, you were higher status. Racism pre-dated racism, if you get my drift, it was mere class-based xenophobia back then. To be 'truly white' you had to have no tan.Since meat was hard to come by, peasants were 95% vegan by default, yet working the fields, so vitamin D deficiency was not a problem, for the 1% aristocracy (since they had their oily fish, red meat and dairy) or for the 99% that had to spend lots of time outdoors.I am not sure where you are coming from regarding the Gulf Stream and cereals. The Fertile Crescent was where farming began for Europe, with wheat not actually growing in the UK and other grains (barley) being the chosen grain. It was only with the Norman Conquest that wheat made it to the UK.When the Romans made it to the UK they were perplexed at what they found. There were two tribes, the nomadic cattle types and the hill fort living grain growers that were not nomadic. The hill forts got in the way of the migration routes between pastures. The Romans were disgusted by the milk drinking since nobody would do that in Rome, where everyone was lactose intolerant, unlike the Celts.",

          "content": "If there was one critical miscalculation the West (particularly the US) made in the last 40 years, it was thinking that investment in China would equal liberalization and democratic reforms. There was a mistaking of capitalism for human rights. While it is a human right to own property and use it to rationally pursue one's self-interests, that does not mean that capitalism in its current form is conducive to that for the greatest number of people, or to the evolution of other human rights in the societies in which capitalism is practiced.If investment was the key to liberalization, we would have seen far greater investment behind the then-fallen Iron Curtain, where countries had actively turned their backs on command economies. The cynic in me thinks that capital didn't like just how that had turned out. If a country's people could either violently (Romania) or peacefully (almost everywhere else) remove such totalitarian systems of politics and economics, they could also reject methods of accumulating capital that might run afoul of their values.China, on the other hand, had not moved away from command economics at the time. Instead, the result was state capitalism. People were free to try new things that could create economic expansion, but only in a way that served the needs of the state. Anything else would be handled with the same totalitarian methods that political dissidents and class enemies were once handled with under Mao. While this has ebbed and flowed over the years, it essentially remains the system in place.Lai is a victim of this miscalculation.",

With the new layout, it would be impossible to bring back up the TV the way it was brought down. There was no other way to access the basement (it only had storm cellar windows), so they left it there when they moved.I think about the new owners sometimes and wonder what they ended up doing.

So we decided to throw it away. I had never picked it up before and had forgotten how heavy CRTs could be. I ended up having to get two friends to come help me move it to the curb, it was well over 250 lbs.

          "content": "Projectors (front/rear/enclosed/whatever) could produce a huge image, but they had their own issues.In a bright room, the contrast was typically lacking.Even on relatively late versions like the Toshiba 57HX93 (a 57\" 16x9 doghouse from ~20 years ago with an integrated scaler and a 1080i input), which I personally spent some time with both in Toshiba form and as $10k Runco-branded units.  Things got washed out in a bright room compared to a direct-view CRT.And viewing angle is an issue, too:  Whether front- or rear-projection, one of the tricks to improve brightness (and therefore potential contrast) is to reduce the angle of light transmission from the screen.  Depending on the room layout, this can mean that people in seats off to the side might get a substantially darker image than those near the middle.  (This applies to all projectors; film, CRT, DLP, LCD, front, rear, whatever -- there can be a lot of non-obvious tech that goes into a projection screen.)And CRT projectors were fickle.  Their color convergence would change based on external magnetic fields (including that produced by the Earth itself), so they needed to be set up properly in-situ.  A projection set that was set up properly while facing East would be a different thing when rotated 90 degrees to instead face North:  What once was carefully-adjusted to produce 3 overlapping images that summed to be pure white lines would be a weird mix of red, blue, and green lines that only sometimes overlapped.The CRT tubes themselves were generally quite impressively small for the size of the image that they'd ultimately produce.  This meant pushing the phosphor coatings quite hard, which translated into an increased opportunity for permanent image retention (\"screen burn\") from things like CNN logos and video game scores.Plus:  They'd tend to get blurry over time.  Because they were being pushed hard, the CRTs were liquid-cooled using glycol that was supposed to be optically-clear.  But stuff would sometimes grow in there.  It was never clear whether this was flora or [micro]fauna or something else, but whatever it was liked living in a world filled with hot, brightly-lit glycol.  Service shops could correct this by changing the fluid, but that's an expense and inconvenience that direct-view CRTs didn't have.And they were ungainly things in other ways.  Sure, they tended to be lighter (less-massive) because they were full of air instead of leaded glass, but a rear-projection set was generally a big floor-standing thing that still had plenty of gravity.  Meanwhile, a front-projection rig ~doubled the chance of someone walking by occluding the view and came with the burden of a hard-to-clean screen (less important these days, but it used to be common for folks to smoke indoors) and its own additional alignment variables (and lens selection, and dust issues, and, and).So a person could deal with all that, or -- you know -- just get a regular direct-view CRT.Even today where projectors use friggin' laser beams for illumination and produce enormous, bright images with far fewer issues than I listed above, direct-view tech (like the flat LCD and *LED sets at any big-box) is still much more popular.(But I do feel your pain.  When I was a teenager, my parents came home from shopping one wintry night with a 36\" Sony WEGA for me to help unload.  Holy hell.)",

CGA ran at 200 lines, so was safely possible with a 60Hz refresh rate.If you wanted more vertical resolution then you needed either a monitor with a higher horizontal refresh rate or you needed to reduce the effective vertical refresh rate. The former involved more expensive monitors, the latter was typically implemented by still having the CRT refresh at 60Hz but drawing alternate lines each refresh. This meant that the effective refresh rate was 30Hz, which is what you're alluding to.But the reason you're being downvoted is that at no point was the CRT running with a low refresh rate, and best practice was to use a mode that your monitor could display without interlace anyway.

          "content": "This is Garman SafeReturn, and this is its first real save.\nHere's a demo.[1] It's been shipping since about 2020, originally on the Cirrus Vision Jet. There's a lot going on. The system is aware of terrain, weather, and fuel, but not of runway status. So it gives the ground a few minutes to get ready, sending voice emergency messages to ATC.\nIf you watch the flight track, you can see the aircraft circle several times, some distance from the airport, then do a straight-in approach. It sets up for landing, wheels down, flaps down, lands, brakes, and turns of the the engine. It doesn't taxi. Someone from the ground will have to tow or taxi the aircraft off the runway.It's mostly GPS driven, plus a radar altimeter for landing.The system can be triggered by a button in the cockpit, a button in the passenger area, and a system that detects the pilot isn't making any inputs for a long period or the aircraft is unstable and the pilot isn't trying to stabilize it. The pilot can take control back, but if they don't, the airplane will be automatically landed.[1] https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-ruFmgTpqA",

The whole basis of certified aircraft is that they may not change, which makes improvements like airframe parachutes, auto land systems, and even terrain awareness, engine monitoring, etc. very costly to obtain. I think there is an argument to be made that there should be a pathway to airframe recertification to allow for innovation and improvement to take place in the aviation industry.Instead, the FAA is probably going backwards on this issue and doubling down on the regulatory framework that gave us the MAX-8 situation while narrowing any avenue for smaller firms to innovate [0][0] https://avbrief.com/faa-wants-to-phase-out-ders",

From my specific perspective in IT, the increasing centralization across every vendor category (three major x86 server manufacturers, two CPU vendors, two GPU makers, three global-scale public clouds, ISP mono- and duopolies, a handful of commercial operating systems, a near-monopoly EUVL supplier - the list goes on) is a dire threat to not just the open internet, but open technology in general.We need to be better advocates for and champions of the technological future we envision, rather than just blindly celebrate startups and tech fads all the time.

          "content": "The normalization of internet shutdowns as a \"riot control\" tool is deeply concerning, especially given how technically unsophisticated most implementations are. In many cases, governments aren't doing surgical BGP manipulation - they're literally ordering ISPs to turn off infrastructure or block DNS at the national level. This is the equivalent of cutting power to an entire city to stop a protest in one neighborhood.What's particularly insidious is the asymmetry: governments can coordinate offline through military/police radio while citizens lose all communication infrastructure. The $1.5B average economic impact cited in the article is conservative - it doesn't account for destroyed business relationships, lost international contracts, or long-term reputation damage from being seen as \"internet shutdown country.\"The technical countermeasures are evolving but limited. Mesh networks like Briar or Bridgefy work peer-to-peer over Bluetooth but have tiny range. Satellite internet (Starlink) requires hardware that's easy to detect/confiscate. eSIM switching only works if neighboring countries' towers reach across borders. The hardest problem is the \"last mile\" - even if you can get data out via satellite/mesh, how do you distribute it locally when cellular is down?We need international frameworks treating internet access as critical infrastructure with humanitarian protections, similar to water/electricity during conflicts. The ITU could mandate technical transparency - requiring governments to publicly log shutdown orders with specific geographic/temporal scope rather than blanket national blackouts. That wouldn't prevent shutdowns but would create accountability records.",

But the thing is... that if this isn't what they steal they'll steal something else.Meanwhile locking down those apps so the only apps with a certain signature can read from your WhatsApp means that if you want to back up your messages or read them for any legitimate purpose you're now SOL, or reliant on a usually slow, non-automatable UI-only flow.I'm glad that modern computers are more secure than they have been, but I think that defense in depth by locking down everything and creating more silos is a problem of its own.",

Having experienced that in practice it... absolutely sucks.At this point it makes me feel like we need something like an async audit API. Maybe the OS just tracks and logs all of your apps' activity and then:1) You can view it of course.2) The OS monitors for deviations from expected patterns for that app globally (kinda like Microsoft's SmartScreen?)3) Your own apps can get permission to read this audit log if you want to analyze it your own way and/or be more secure. If you're more paranoid maybe you could use a variant that kills an app in a hurry if it's misbehaving.Sadly you can't even implement this as a third party thing on macOS at this point because the security model prohibits you from monitoring other apps.

Random code shouldn't have \"ambient authority\" to just do anything on my computer with the same privileges as me.

But it shouldn't get ambient authority to access anything else on my computer. No network access. No filesystem. Nothing.Philosophically, I kind of think of it like function arguments and globals. If I call a function foo(someobj), then function foo is explicitly given access to someobj. And it also has access to any globals in my program. But we generally consider globals to be smelly. Passing data explicitly is better.But the whole filesystem is essentially available as a global that any function, anywhere, can access. With full user permissions. I say no. I want languages where the filesystem itself (or a subset of it) can be passed as an argument. And if a function doesn't get passed a filesystem, it can't access a filesystem. If a function isn't passed a network socket, it can't just create one out of nothing.I don't think it would be that onerous. The main function would get passed \"the whole operating system\" in a sense - like the filesystem and so on. And then it can pass files and sockets and whatnot to functions that need access to that stuff.If we build something like that, we should be able to build something like npm but where you don't need to trust the developers of 3rd party software so much.

Every ecosystem I touch now (apart from gamedev, but only because I roll everything myself there by choice) has this - e.g Cargo has a lot of \"tools\" that you install globally so that you get some capability (like flamegraphs, asm output, test runners etc.) - this is the same vulnerability, manifesting slightly differently.

It is also common to get random \"utility\" tools during builds in CI/CD pipelines, just by curl-ing random URLs of various \"release archives\".

This is not any issue in the author’s engineering but an inherent issue in LLMs. The reason it is so noticeable in this case is because the subject matter is extremely familiar to the user: themselves.LLMs consistently misrepresent information in this exact same way in, more critical applications. Because they are often employed on datasets that engineers and potentially end users are not deeply familiar with, the results often seem exceptional.Disclaimer via my HN wrapped: \n“The Anti LLM Manifesto\nYou will write a 5,000-word blog post on why a single Bayesian prior is more 'sentient' than GPT-6, and it will be ignored because the summary was generated by a 3B parameter model.”",

We have unit tests, we review PRs, etc. but those don't account for taste. I need to know if the feature feels right to the end user.One example: we recently changed something about our onboarding flow. I needed to create a fresh team and go thru the onboarding flow dozens of times. It involves adding third party integrations (e.g. Postgres, a CRM, etc.) and each one can behave a little different. The full process can take 5 to 10 minutes.I want an agent go thru the flow hundreds of times, trying different things (i.e. trying to break it) before I do it myself. There are some obvious things I catch on the first pass that an agent should easily identify and figure out solutions to.New Kind of \"Note to Self\": Many of the voice memos, Loom videos, or notes I make (and later email to myself) are feature ideas. These could be 10x better with agents. If there were a local app recording my screen while I talk thru a problem or feature, agents could be picking up all sorts of context that would improve the final note.Example: You're recording your screen and say \"this drop down menu should have an option to drop the cache\". An agent could be listening in, capture a screenshot of the menu, find the frontend files / functions related to caching, and trace to the backend endpoints. That single sentence would become a full spec for how to implement the feature.",

So there's a bit of apples-to-oranges in terms of release tagging for the log/trace.It's a really interesting problem to solve, because you could in theory try to retroactively find which LLM session, potentially from days prior, matches a commit that just hit a central repository. You could automatically connect the LLM session to the PR that incorporated the resulting code.Though, might this discourage developers from openly iterating with their LLM agent, if there's a panopticon around their whole back-and-forth with the agent?Someone can, and should, create a plug-and-play system here with the right permission model that empowers everyone, including the Programmer-Archaeologists (to borrow shamelessly from Vernor Vinge) who are brought in to \"un-vibe the vibe code\" and benefit from understanding the context and evolution.But I don't think that \"just dump it in clickhouse\" is a viable solution for most folks out there, even if they have the infrastructure and experience with OTel stacks.",

Too much contextual knowledge, too much detail in the nuances of human-human interaction, and too much je ne sais quoi in the timing of getting humor right.

Kevin Perjurer is quite a good documentarian, and there's very little trimmable fat on the four-hour product if you want to keep in all the points he made.gkoberger's peer comment is a pretty good summary. Another interesting point is that these technologies can benefit the brand bottom-line even when they don't make it into the park, because part of Disney's brand is \"tomorrow today.\" Even when things are one-offs, they become one-offs that people stitch into the legend of the parks (in both the retelling and in their own memories), which gives them a larger-than-life feel; your visit might not include one of the \"living characters,\" and statistically it probably won't.... but it might. And if it does, you'll never forget it.Personal anecdote / example: I stopped in at the \"droid factory\" in the Star Wars: Galaxy's Edge area of Disney World a few years back. They had several bits of merch for sale including one life-size R2-D2, inert. I took a close look at the R2 because it was an impressive bit of work. Turned around to look at a rack of t-shirts. And was, therefore, startled as hell to hear a bwoop behind me, turn around, and see that it had followed me out of its charging receptacle and was staring at me. It was not at all inert; it was a very impressive operational remote-control replica.The cast member behind the counter was doing his best to hold down his grin and not give me a \"GOTCHA\" look. He has to, because you never know what kids might be watching and he doesn't want to break the magic. And... Yeah, he got me good. \"That time I was at Disney World and R2-D2 followed me around the t-shirt shop\" is gonna stick with me.",

      "content_cn": "我拿到了苹果开发者证书，并构建了一个简单的应用来解决我遇到的一个问题。我常光顾的一家店铺没有苹果钱包通行证。由于构建这些非常简单的功能需要签名证书，我创建了一个极简应用来为它们签名。如果你也需要，这个应用可供使用。它不会用AI扫描卡片——你需要手动输入条形码，我认为这样更不容易出错。",
      "abstract": "该帖子讨论了一款名为WalletWallet的工具，它允许用户手动输入条形码信息来创建Apple Wallet通行证，以解决部分商家不提供电子卡券的问题。核心话题围绕该工具的实用性、隐私安全及技术限制展开。\n\n多数用户肯定其便捷性，认为手动输入条形码虽不如AI扫描自动化，但能减少识别错误，尤其适用于实体会员卡数字化。同时，隐私问题成为焦点，有用户指出通行证数据需发送至服务器进行苹果证书签名，引发对数据安全的担忧；多人建议实现本地处理以规避风险。此外，讨论中提到部分条形码格式（如Codebar）不被Apple Wallet支持，限制了工具适用范围。\n\n社区共识在于肯定工具解决了特定需求，尤其在处理无电子化服务的商家卡券时表现实用。分歧主要体现在对隐私保护程度的期待，以及是否应优先支持更多条形码格式。也有用户批评工具创新性不足，质疑其开发价值。整体上，讨论呈现对工具功能肯定与对隐私、兼容性优化的期待并存的态度。",

          "content": "> It won't scan cards with AI - you manually enter the barcode, which I think makes it less prone to error.This is a very interesting sentence.I interpret this sentence as saying that manually entering a barcode is less error prone than letting AI do it, that AI would have an unacceptable margin of error (and this is probably an accurate assessment).But you don't need AI to find or read barcodes. Finding and reading barcodes is a reasonably mature technology that has existed long before AI.Barcodes exist as a fast, machine readable data transfer format meant to avoid data entry errors by avoiding manual data entry, and yet you've implemented manual entry in order to avoid errors?Now, if one of the constraints you've put on your implementation is that it work only in the browser and you don't want to have to download a large barcode scanning library to the browser, then it makes sense to implement manual entry. But that has nothing to do with AI.That being said, there are some barcode reading apps that can be used to prompt for a scan from a web page, and you get the barcode payload back. I've used an app called \"bineye\" on Android (source on GitHub) that works like this. This helps avoid error prone manual entry and gets the full barcode payload (many barcodes store/encode more information than the human readable text printed next to them).",

          "content": "I read this article back when I was learning the basics of transformers; the visualizations were really helpful. Although in retrospect knowing how a transformer works wasn't very useful at all in my day job applying LLMs, except as a sort of deep background for reassurance that I had some idea of how the big black box producing the tokens was put together, and to give me the mathematical basis for things like context size limitations etc.I would strongly caution anyone who thinks that they will be able to understand or explain LLM behavior better by studying the architecture closely. That is a trap. Big SotA models these days exhibit so much nontrivial emergent phenomena (in part due to the massive application of reinforcement learning techniques) that give them capabilities very few people expected to ever see when this architecture first arrived. Most of us confidently claimed even back in 2023 that, based on LLM architecture and training algorithms, LLMs would never be able to perform well on novel coding or mathematics tasks. We were wrong. That points towards some caution and humility about using network architecture alone to reason about how LLMs work and what they can do. You'd really need to be able to poke at the weights inside a big SotA model to even begin to answer those kinds of questions, but unfortunately that's only really possible if you're a \"mechanistic interpretability\" researcher at one of the major labs.Regardless, this is a nice article, and this stuff is worth learning because it's interesting for its own sake! Right now I'm actually spending some vacation time implementing a transformer in PyTorch just to refresh my memory of it all. It's a lot of fun! If anyone else wants to get started with that I would highly recommend Sebastian Raschka's book and youtube videos as way into the subject: https://github.com/rasbt/LLMs-from-scratch .Has anyone read TFA author Jay Alammar's book (published Oct 2024) and would they recommend it for a more up-to-date picture?",

However, I’m a firm believer that understanding the internals of a LLM can set you apart as an gen AI engineer, if you’re interested in becoming the top 1% in your field. There can and will be situations where your intuition about the constraints of your model is superior compared to peers who consider the LLM a black box. I had this advice given directly to me years ago, in person, by Clem Delangue of Hugging Face - I took it seriously and really doubled down on understanding the guts of LLMs. I think it’s served me well.I’d give similar advice to any coding bootcamp grad: yes you can get far by just knowing python and React, but to reach the absolute peak of your potential and join the ranks of the very best in the world in your field, you’ll eventually want to dive deep into computer architecture and lower level languages. Knowing these deeply will help you apply your higher level code more effectively than your coding bootcamp classmates over the course of a career.",

Just simply more dimensions in a layer.And consequently, you can represent the entire transformer architecture with a set of deep layers as you unroll the matricies, with a lot of zeros for the multiplication pieces that are not needed.This is a fairly complex blog but it shows that its just all matrix multiplication all the way down. https://pytorch.org/blog/inside-the-matrix/.",

The model has learned to dump locally-specific reasoning tokens where they're needed, in a tightly scoped cluster that can be attended to easily, and forgetting about just as easily later on. It's like a disposable scratchpad to reduce the errors in the code it's about to write.The solution to comment spam is textual/AST post-processing of generated code, rather than prompting the LLM to handicap itself by not generating as much comments.",

Understanding how transformers work absolutely can help debug problems (or avoid them in the first place). People without a deep understanding of LLMs also tend to get fooled by them more frequently. When you have internalized the fact that LLMs are literally optimistized to trick you, you tend to be much more skeptical of the initial results (which results in better eval suites etc).Then there's people who actually do AI engineering. If you're working with local/open weights models or on the inference end of things you can't just play around with an API, you have a lot more control and observability into the model and should be making use of it.I still hold that the best test of an AI Engineer, at any level of the \"AI\" stack, is how well they understand speculative decoding.

I'd save that expense unless you need some huge multi-step verifiable plan implemented.The biggest gotcha I found is that these LLMs love to assume that code is C/Python but just in your favorite language of choice. Instead of considering that something should be written encapsulated into an object to maintain state, it will instead write 5 functions, passing the state as parameters between each function. It will also consistently ignore most of the code around it, even if it could benefit from reading it to know what specifically could be reused. So you end up with copy-pasta code, and unstructured copy-pasta at best.The other gotcha is that claude usually ignores CLAUDE.md. So for me, I first prompt it to read it and then I prompt it to next explore. Then, with those two rules, it usually does a good job following my request to fix, or add a new feature, or whatever, all within a single context. These recent agents do a much better job of throwing away useless context.I do think the older models and agents get better results when writing things to a plan document, but I've noticed recent opus and sonnet usually end up just writing the same code to the plan document anyway.

The data is inconsistent, partially undocumented, and correctness is only visible once you actually look at the rendered output. That makes it a bad fit for naïve one-shotting.What’s worked is splitting responsibility very explicitly:• Human (me): judge correctness against reality. I look at the data, the UI, and say things like “these six media files must collapse into one post”, “stories should not appear in this mode”, “timestamps are wrong”. This part is non-negotiably human.• LLM as planner/architect: translate those judgments into invariants and constraints (“group by export container, never flatten before grouping”, “IG mode must only consider media/posts/*”, “fallback must never yield empty output”). This model is reasoning about structure, not typing code.• LLM as implementor (Codex-style): receives a very boring, very explicit prompt derived from the plan. Exact files, exact functions, no interpretation, no design freedom. Its job is mechanical execution.Crucially, I don’t ask the same model to both decide what should change and how to change it. When I do, rework explodes, especially in pipelines where the ground truth lives outside the code (real data + rendered output).This also mirrors something the article hints at but doesn’t fully spell out: the codebase isn’t just context, it’s a contract. Once the planner layer encodes the rules, the implementor can one-shot surprisingly large changes because it’s no longer guessing intent.The challenges are mostly around discipline:• You have to resist letting the implementor improvise.• You have to keep plans small and concrete.• You still need guardrails (build-time checks, sanity logs) because mistakes are silent otherwise.But when it works, it scales much better than long conversational prompts. It feels less like “pair programming with an AI” and more like supervising a very fast, very literal junior engineer who never gets tired, which, in practice, is exactly what these tools are good at.",

Then the LLM won't either.Of course, but the problem is the converse: There are too many situations where a peer engineer will know what to do but the agent won't. This means that it requires more work to make a codebase understandable to a human than it does to make it understandable to an agent.> Moving more implementation feedback from human to computer helps us improve the chance of one-shotting... Think of these as bumper rails. You can increase the likelihood of an LLM reaching the bowling pins by making it impossible to land in the gutter.Sort of,  but this is also a little similar to claiming that P = NP. Having a an efficient way to reliably check if a solution is correct is not the same at all as a reliable way to find a solution. It's the theory of computation that tells us that it probably isn't. The likelihood may well be higher yet still not high enough. Even though theoretically NP problems are strictly easier than EXPTIME ones, in practice, in many situations (though not all) they are equally intractable.In fact, we can put the claim to the test: there are languages, like ATS and Idris, that make almost any property provable and checkable. These languages let the programmer (human or machine) position the \"bumper rails\" so precisely as to ensure we hit the target. We can ask the agent to write the code, write the proof of correctness, and check it. We'd still need to check that the correctness property is the right one, but if the claim is correct, coding agents should be best at writing code, accompanied by correctness proofs, in ATS or Idris. Are they?Obviously, mileage mauy vary dependning on the task and the domain, but if it's true that coding models will get significantly better, then the best course of action may well be, in many cases, to just wait until they do rather than spend a lot of effort working around their current limitations, effort that will be wasted if and when capabilities improve.

It does not have Fourier transform, and we cannot operate on the frequency domain. However, the moving average can suffice as a simple filter.```I wonder if there's a way to implement the FFT using subqueries and OVER/partitioning? That would create a lot of room for some interesting stuff to happen, specifically making it easy/possible to implement filters, compression, reverberation, and other kinds of effects.Two other primitives that would be valuable to figure out:\n1. How to implement FM/phase distortion. You can basically implement a whole universe of physical modeling if you get basic 6 op sine wave primitives right with FM + envelopes.\n2. Sampling/resampling - given clickhouse should do quite well with storing raw sample data, being able to sample/resample opens up a whole world of wavetable synthesis algorithms, as well as vocal editing, etc.Honestly, although the repo's approach is basic, I think the overall approach is wonderful and have wanted to be able to use SQL to write music for a while. I've spent a lot of time writing music in trackers, and being able to use SQL feels like it would be one of the few things that could spiritually be a successor to it. I've looked at other live coding languages, many of which are well built and have been used by talented people to make good music (such as Tidal, Strudel, etc). But all of it seems like a step down in language from SQL. I'd rather have their capabilities accessible from SQL than have to use another language and its limitations just to get those capabilities.Food for thought -- thanks for the interesting and thoughtful work!",
