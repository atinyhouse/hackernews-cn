      "abstract": "该讨论围绕“死互联网理论”展开，核心话题是人工智能生成内容对网络生态的冲击及社交媒体的真实性危机。多数用户担忧AI内容泛滥导致网络体验空洞化，例如有用户指出Threads和Instagram上大量病毒式帖子由AI生成，令人对网络人际连接感到失望。讨论中普遍认同平台激励机制助长了低质内容泛滥，如YouTube为点击量付费、LinkedIn鼓励自我营销，导致内容质量下降。\n\n主要分歧体现在应对策略上。有人认为应建立AI内容标注机制或开发能有效禁止AI的社交平台，通过分析图像元数据、用户交互行为等技术手段识别机器人；但也有用户反对强制标注，认为这难以监管且会抑制创作自由。此外，部分用户悲观预测网络将完全由AI主导，人类可能因此重新回归现实社交；另有观点强调问题的根源在于资本对用户增长和参与度的无限追求，在人口和上网时长饱和的背景下，平台只能依赖自动化内容维持增长。整体上，社区对网络真实性退化感到忧虑，但在解决方案上存在技术治理与自由放任之间的争论。",

I watch part of the video and even though it felt off I couldn't immediately tell for sure if it was fake or not. Nevertheless I googled the names and details and found nothing but repostings of the video. Then I looked at the youtube channel info and there it said it uses AI for \"some\" of the videos to recreate \"real\" events. I really doubt that.. it all looks fake. I am just worried about how much divisiveness this kind of stuff will create all so someone can profit off of youtube ads.. it's sad.",

In the end, that is what most of internet interactions are comprised of, done directly by humans, algorithms or other ways.There are bits and pieces of exceptions to that rule, and maybe closer to the beginning, before widespread use, there was a bigger percentage, but today, in the big numbers the usage is not so different from what LLMs does.",

That's nowhere near \"production ready\" as the author's LLM says.I've seen, 17 year ago, a schoolboy make \"his own OS\", which was simply Ubuntu with replaced logos. He got on TV with it, IIRC he was promoting it on the internets (forums back then), and kept insisting that this was his own work. He was bullied in response and in a few weeks disappeared from the nets.What has it to do with me personally, if I'm not the author, nor a bully? Today I learned that I can't trust the new libraries posted in official repos. They can be just wrapper code slop. In 2012, Jack Diedrich in his speech \"Stop Writing Classes\" said that he'd read every library source code to find if there was anything stinky. I used to think it's a luxury of time and his qualification to read into what you use. Now it became a necessity, at least for new projects.",

I faintly recall this time period because I tried to sign up for it only to find out that while there had been an announcement that it was opened up internationally, it still only let you sign up with a dot EDU email address, which none of the universities in my country had.In the early years \"social media\" was a lot more about having a place to express yourself or share your ideas and opinions so other people you know could check up on them. Many remember the GIF anarchy and crimes against HTML of Geocities but that aesthetic also carried over to MySpace while sites like Live Journal or Tumblr more heavily emphasized prose. This was all also in the context of a more open \"blogosphere\" where (mostly) tech nerds would run their own blogs and connect intentionally much like \"webrings\" did in the earlier days for private homepages and such before search engine indexing mostly obliterated their main use.Facebook pretty much created modern \"social media\" by creating the global \"timeline\", forcing users to compete with each other (and corporate brands) for each other's attention while also focusing the experience more on consumption and \"reaction\" than creation and self-expression. This in turn resulted in more \"engagement\" which eventually led to algorithmic timelines trying to optimize for engagement and ad placement / \"suggested content\".HN actually follows the \"link aggregator\" or \"news aggregator\" lineage of sites like Reddit, Digg, Fark, etc (there were also \"bookmark aggregators\" like stumbleupon but most of those died out to). In terms of social interactions it's more like e.g. the Slashdot comment section even though the \"feed\" is somewhat \"engagement driven\" like on social media sites.

I went to the actual website of the company and bought from them, because the idea of getting a knock off was a bit scary. To my dismay, I received an Amazon shipping notice after making the purchase outside of Amazon. This brought back my skepticism. I’m still waiting for the package to arrive and will end up inspecting it closely.A few months ago I bought some headphones from Amazon, because the official site was out of stock on the color I wanted. I ended up going on YouTube and finding a video on how to spot authentic pairs vs counterfeit ones to make sure I got the real thing.This all stemmed from when I bought a water bottle, and the reviews mentioned this commingling issue and how to spot authentic real one vs a fake. I double checked that I was buying from the company’s listing and not one of the other sellers on the item. I received a counterfeit one. Thankfully this review tipped me off. I lost a significant amount of trust in Amazon that day. A random bottle isn’t something I even thought I needed to worry about counterfeit version for.Amazon has a long way to go to rebuild trust with me. This is a step in the right direction. The fact that it took this long is pretty sad. Amazon is the only mainstream store where I’ve ever had to question if I was buying legitimate goods or not.",

They seem to have a \"Brand+/Certified Original\" program - any idea how trustworthy that is? Probably more than Amazon with commingling, but in absolute terms?",

Ten years ago, commingling was a necessary optimization. If seller A (county A) and seller B (county B) both sold the same widget, Amazon treated them as a single distributed liquidity pool to guarantee 2-day prime shipping nationwide without forcing every small seller to split their stock across 10 warehouses.Now that Amazon has moved to a highly regionalized fulfillment model (where they aggressively penalize sellers who don't have stock distributed across regions), the computational and reputational overhead of commingling outweighs the diminishing returns on shipping speed. For all intents and purposes, they have traded the operational complexity of physical sorting for the software complexity of forcing sellers to manage regional inventory better.",

If seller A (county A) and seller B (county B) both sold the same widget, Amazon treated them as a single distributed liquidity pool to guarantee 2-day prime shipping nationwide without forcing every small seller to split their stock across 10 warehouses.I don't see why that required commingling. When I click on a Foo in my Amazon search results show me the Foo from whichever of A or B is close enough to meet the 2-day shipping guarantee. If I care which of A or B it actually comes from I can click the option to see other sellers and decide if giving up 2-day shipping is worth getting my preferred seller.",

From the modern perspective, it's a function purpose-built to abet counterfeiters.However, look at their origins as a used book seller. When my sister went off to college, I got most of her books off Amazon for a third the price of the university bookstore, and they were all from third-party sellers promising they had a particular edition and printing of a given book. All the same ISBN regardless of where they came from. It made sense in that context, to consider all sources of a given item to be the same item.However, at that time (2005), all the books shipped from their individual sellers, there was no opportunity for stock commingling. If one had turned up counterfeit, blame would've been trivial.So I don't think \"3rd-party sellers\" is necessarily the cutoff point.

          "content": "There was some overhead to commingling once it got extended to FBA, because in order to increase commingling they did attempt to track inventory provenance information even on commingled inventory.My first job out of college in 2013 was working at Amazon on one of the teams that was implementing inventory commingling at the warehouse level, and my first big project was implementing this process into the receiving software, which is when inventory arrives at warehouses from vendor/seller trucks and employees scan everything to make database records that lead to paying for the goods. Note: in Amazon lingo \"vendor\" means a provider of goods that are legally purchased and owned by Amazon in the warehouse, while \"sellers\" are FBA sellers that maintain ownership of their goods and basically rent Amazon's warehouse services.The big software undertaking was determining, at inventory receive time, whether we trusted the seller enough to allow their inventory to be commingled with others. If yes we would be \"virtually track\" the provenance: store in the database a record of the vendor, but if the item became commingled (according to UPC scans as it moves around the warehouse) with other sellers' inventory, blur the information so as to not falsely attribute provenance when it was no longer known. The whole project was based off the cost:benefit analysis that the efficiency and customer experience benefits outweighed the cost of not being able to attribute damage to the correct vendors (particularly the fact that you could ship a customer a product from the closest warehouse that it had it, instead of transshipping it from the warehouse that had the one owned by the person they bought it from).In cases where sellers were not trusted enough to commingle there were alternate processes that were supposed to track their items individually; the most granular was \"LPN\" receive, license-plate-number, where every product got an individual UPC to distinguish it from all others. This was borrowed from Zappos, whose one warehouse in Vegas was initially the only one who used this process; I was told that was because the online shoe business heavily relied on letting customers do loads of returns and so it was implemented out of necessity early on. One of our projects was rolling LPN out to more of the North American network. But it was a lot more expensive (in the stickers, labor, data management, and picking inefficiency) so it was dispreferred whenever possible.At the time the whole commingling initiative was regarded to be a big win for both Amazon and customers. It was fairly janky from the beginning, though, and I'm not at all surprised that sellers (and to a lesser extent vendors) began taking advantage of it as soon as they began to realize how it worked. There were a lot of initiatives around the time I left to provide better accountability in the whole process, but it is ultimately an arms race between Amazon and the merchants and my impression is that for many years Amazon was losing.It is amusing that they're ending it. I never heard how things were going after I left, but had the impression externally that it was ending up being a disaster, and knowing how it works on the inside it's not a surprise. In hindsight trusting FBA sellers to not become essentially malevolent actors seems comically naive.",

If I had been Googling to find possibly relevant material instead of using LLMs to find possibly relevant material, I probably would have bought from Amazon.With Googling the \"figure out what is going wrong\" part of solving the problem is more decoupled from the \"figure out where to buy this thing\" part. The first part involves Googling, looking at a bunch of results, finding a lot are not relevant, trying to refine the search, and repeating probably many times. After that time consuming process when I have finally decided that I needed a new cable I'd probably just go to Amazon without thinking about it.I always have a little doubt when buying from Amazon because of commingling, but usually not enough to look deeper into it unless the product is something with a high risk of it.With the LLM instead of Google I upfront described to it a lot of details of my equipment, how I was using it, what symptoms I was seeing, what diagnostic steps I'd taken and the results of those, and why I believe certain things that could cause such problems would not be applicable in my case.It then finds all the stuff I would have found by Googling, but because it also has way more information from what I told it at the start it can eliminate a whole bunch of the irrelevant results, so I'm starting out way ahead of where I would be after a first Google. A little back and forth and I know what I need to buy.At that point I'm still at the LLM screen. Since it is right there tossing in a final question about buying from Amazon vs Best Buy is trivial.I'm not a frequent LLM user. I have yet to pay for any LLM. (I did have a year of free Perplexity Pro that Xfinity gave to its customers a little over a year ago, but when that expired I did not subscribe.(There's a funny story there--when it expired and they tried to convince me to subscribe, I asked Perplexity if a subscription would be worth it. It told me that considering my usage patterns the free plan was perfectly fine for me and I should stick with that).A lot of people now are using LLMs instead of or before traditional Google-style searches when they want information. Not just techies or early adopters. The are or are quickly becoming mainstream.If they are recommending not buying from Amazon that might be something Amazon would want to address.",

The power-button, unprotected by the case, got scratched. The button doubles as a fingerprint reader, which ceased working due to the scratch. At first, I thought \"no worries, this phone is friendly to those who want to repair it.\"It turns out, this part is not available for replacement. I think this is an oversight; just like the screen, it is an outward facing part, hence, bound to be damaged for some.Then, I brought it to my local repair shop. The owner had to tell me that they cannot repair Fairphone's, and that, for him, it is one of the worst companies to deal with. They try to centralise all repairs in their own repair center. Which means sending the phone -- which I need -- away for 2 weeks; paying a fee for diagnosis, an unknown cost for repair, and the hassle of a flashed phone. I already know what's broken, I just want the part.I feel this is a real shame, as I am fully supportive of the stated aims of the company, and I want the product to be good.[Aside: suggestions on how to deal with a scratched fingerprint reader are most welcome. E.g. can the scatch be re-painted? The phone thinks the reader is there, but it doesn't register any touch. ]",

I think that usually universities cannot force the use of personal devices for work, so providing mobile phones on request is one way of moving to a more purely Microsoft service infrastructure. It looks like Radboud is a Microsoft shop, so I would not be surprised.My university, for example, is gradually removing all office phones (already voip) and replacing them with Teams voip as the only phone system for the university, encouraging personal phone use of Teams, but having computer-based use as the option for people who refuse. As they don't provide mobile phones, however, they can't require Microsoft Authenticator, and so at least officially will still give hardware keys on request (and fortunately still allow TOTP, even if they don't advertise it).",

That mode is primarily for developing jobs you'll later run on a Hadoop cluster over more data. But, for smaller datasets, that local mode can be significantly faster than running on a cluster with Hadoop. That's especially true for transient AWS EMR clusters — for smaller jobs, local mode often finishes before the cluster is up and ready to start working.Even so, I bet the author's approach is still significantly faster than mrjob's local mode for that dataset. What MapReduce brought was a constrained computation model that made it easy to scale way up. That has trade-offs that typically aren't worth it if you don't need that scale. Scaling up here refers to data that wouldn't easily fit on disks of the day — the ability to seamlessly stream input/output data from/to S3 was powerful.I used mrjob a lot in the early 2010s — jobs that I worked on cumulatively processed many petabytes of data. What it enabled you to do, and how easy it was to do it, was pretty amazing when it was first released in 2010. But it hasn't been very relevant for a while now.",

Fun to see it get mentioned more than ten years later.What some commenters don't realize about these bureaucratic IO-heavy expensive tools is that sometimes they are used in order to apply a familiar way of thinking, which has Business Benefits. Sometimes you don't know if your task will take seconds, minutes, hours, days, or weeks on one fast machine with a well-thought-out program, but you really need it to take at most hours, and writing well-thought-out-programs takes time you could spend on other stuff. If you know you can scale the program in advance, it's lower risk to just write it as a Hadoop job and be done with it. Also, it helps to have an \"easy\" pattern for processing Data That Feels Big Even If It Isn't That Big, Although Yelp's Data Actually Was Big. Such was the case with mrjob stuff at Yelp in 2012. They got a lot of mileage out of it!The other funny thing about mrjob is that it's a layer on Hadoop Streaming, which is a term for when the Java process actually running the Hadoop worker opens a subprocess to your Python script which accepts input on stdin and writes output on stdout, rather than working on values in memory.

Hadoop may not be the most efficient way, but when a deliverable is required, Hadoop is a known quantity and really works.I did some interesting work ten years ago, building pipelines to create global raster images of the entire Open Street Map road network [1]. I was able to process the planet in 25 minutes on a $50k cluster.I think I had the opposite problem: Hadoop wasn't shiny enough and Java had a terrible reputation in academic tech circles. I wish I'd known about mrjob because that would have kept the Python maximalists happy.I had lengthy arguments with people who wanted to use Spark which simply did not have the chops for this. With Spark, attempting to process OSM for a small country failed.Another interesting side-effect of using the map-reduce paradigm was with processing vector datasets. PostGIS took multiple days to process the million-vertex Norwegian national parks, however splitting the planet into data density sensitive tiles (~ 2000 vertices) I could process the planet in less than an hour.Then Google Earth Engine came along and I had to either use that, or change career.

The previous approach took 1 hour, involved reading the whole file into memory and parsing it as JSON (when some of the files got over 10GB, even 64GB memory wasnt enough and the system started swapping).It wasn't fast even before swapping (I learned just how slow Python can be), but then basically it took a day to run a single experiment. Then the data got turned into a dataframe.I replaced that part of the Python code processing and outputted a CSV which Pandas could read without having to trip through Python code (I guess it has an internal optimized C implementation).The preprocessor was able to run on the build machines and DSes consumed the CSV directly.",

Most people also do not seem to understand the genius that was contained in JQuery. See \"http://eyeandtea.com/crxcmp\" for an example of what could already be done with JQuery in the IE8 era. A lot of the things later invented in the browser were to mask these shortcomings instead of admitting to them. The shadow DOM is one example. JQuery already had a feature that rendered the shadow DOM unnecessary, but it would require discipline that most developers did not have nor understand.Having said that, after JQuery 1.x, and in particular, the changing, the deprecating, and the dropping of things here and there, JQuery no longer made sense. Somewhat similar to the SDL situation in the C/C++ word. An important role of JQuery, similar to SDL, was a strong code contract before anything else, and if the developer now has to account for JQuery's version differences like having to account for browser differences, what is the point.",

This was early 2021.I kid you not, there were 30+ redux actions chaining in the most incomprehensible ways, the form literally had a textual input, a button to open the file explorer and a submit button.It took few weeks one of their Romanian team to build it and apparently that team was reassigned and nobody could touch it without them.I remember writing pages and pages of notes to understand how this all tied up in those extremely complex chains and claiming progress after few hours when I achieved to simplify the flow by removing a handful of these actions. Hooray.Then it suddenly dawned on me that...I could just rewrite it from scratch.Nuked the entirety of that nonsense and replaced it with a single useState in a matter of few hours also implemented the newly requested features.The client could not believe my progress and the fact I also removed many of their previous issues.Then I had a second realization: React was useless too and it got dropped for native HTML forms and a handful of JS callbacks.",

You will hear this over and over, in every area of every business: people become successful by adjusting their behaviour to what works for the business. Sometimes this is called being a slick politician, sometimes it is called avoiding getting bogged down in politics.But it's never been the case that a dev could just focus on technical things and not spend any time figuring out the context they are working in, and behaving accordingly.My first day of work, this is what my boss said to me: \"Look at this trading floor. There's screens everywhere, everything is numbers. Deltas, gammas, vegas. Everything is calculated by computers. But don't forget, every business is a people business!\"",

LLMs are becoming quite capable at the \"autistic\" skill of coding, but they are still horrible communicators, and don't communicate at all unless spoken to. This is where humans are currently, and maybe for a long time, irreplaceable - using our soft skills to interact with other humans and as always translate and refine fuzzy business requirements into the unforgiving language of the machine, whether that is carefully engineered LLM contexts, or machine code.As far as communication goes, I have to say that Gemini 3.0, great as it is, is starting to grate on me with it's sycophantic style and failure to just respond as requested rather than to blabber on about \"next steps\" that it is constantly trying to second guess from it's history. You can tell it to focus and just answer the question, but that only lasts for one or two conversational turns.One of Gemini's most annoying traits is to cheerfully and authoritatively give design advice, then when questioned admit (or rather tell, as if it were it's own insight) that this advice is catastrophically bad and will lead to a bad outcome, and without pause then tell you what you really should do, as if this is going to be any better.\"You're absolutely right!

Not only the use of Gaussian Splats made such extreme camera movement possible, one can be argued that it made them necessary.Pause the video and notice the blurriness and general lack of details. But the frantic motion doesn't let the viewer focus on this details, most of them hidden by a copious amount of motion blur anyways.To me it is typical of demos, both as in the \"demoscene\" and \"tech demo\" sense, where the art style is driven by the technology, insisting on what it enables, while at the same time working around its shortcomings. I don't consider it a bad thing of course, it leads to a lot of creativity and interesting art styles.",

Demos often aim for a bit more clean visuals (and palettes), blurriness is often tuned in another way.Sadly, much of the demoscene is in a bit of a navel-grazing retro computing phase, many active ones today are \"returners\" from the C64 and Amiga eras whilst PC sceners of the 90s either dropped off for money, games or kids.It's also the sheer work-effort, demoscene in the 90s and early 00s could focus on rendering while visual art pipelines didn't matter as much, as graphics cards got better it was obvious that the scene was falling behind the cutting edge games (both in asset due to workload and hacks required for graphics cards to render realistically).The introduction and early popularization of SDF rendering turned the scene a bit more relevant again, but it's also been masking a certain lack of good artists since programmers could create nice renderings without needing assets.However, to match something like this video in creativity would require a lot of asset workload (and non-trival rendering), and that combo is not really that common today sadly.Funnily enough, I was actually discussing just Gaussian Splatting as a solution for more \"asset heavy\" demos about a year ago with another scener friend, but sadly there's a tad of a stigma culturally as NN/\"AI\" methods has been fairly controversial within the scene, aside from programmers there are both visual and music artists, and among those camps it's not really a popular thing.It's still mostly a method though, and SDF rendering + GS could in the end be a saviour in disguise for the scene to go beyond just rendering and bring back a bit more story-telling to the scene.",

          "content": "Gaussian splatting is a way to record 3-dimensional video. You capture a scene from many angles simultaneously and then combine all of those into a single representation. Ideally, that representation is good enough that you can then, post-production, simulate camera angles you didn't originally record.For example, the camera orbits around the performers in this music video are difficult to imagine in real space. Even if you could pull it off using robotic motion control arms, it would require that the entire choreography is fixed in place before filming. This video clearly takes advantage of being able to direct whatever camera motion the artist wanted in the 3d virtual space of the final composed scene.To do this, the representation needs to estimate the radiance field, i.e. the amount and color of light visible at every point in your 3d volume, viewed from every angle. It's not possible to do this at high resolution by breaking that space up into voxels, those scale badly, O(n^3). You could attempt to guess at some mesh geometry and paint textures on to it compatible with the camera views, but that's difficult to automate.Gaussian splatting estimates these radiance fields by assuming that the radiance is build from millions of fuzzy, colored balls positioned, stretched, and rotated in space. These are the Gaussian splats.Once you have that representation, constructing a novel camera angle is as simple as positioning and angling your virtual camera and then recording the colors and positions of all the splats that are visible.It turns out that this approach is pretty amenable to techniques similar to modern deep learning. You basically train the positions/shapes/rotations of the splats via gradient descent. It's mostly been explored in research labs but lately production-oriented tools have been built for popular 3d motion graphics tools like Houdini, making it more available.",

          "content": "Yes, it's quite trivial to convert traditional CG to Gaussian splats. We can render our scenes/objects just as we would capture physical spaces. The additional benefits of using synthetic data is 100% accurate camera poses (alignment) which means the structure from motion (SfM) step can be bypassed.It's also possible to splat from textured meshes directly, see: https://github.com/electronicarts/mesh2splat. This approach yields high quality, PBR compatible splats, but is not quite as efficient as a traditional training workflow. This approach will likely become mainstream in third party render engines, moving forward.Why do this? \n1. Consistent, streamlined visuals across a massive ecosystem, including content creation tools, the web, and XR headsets. \n2. High fidelity, compressed visuals. With SOGs compression, splats are going to become the dominant 3D representation on the web (see https://superspl.at). \n3. E-commerce (product visualizations, tours, real-estate, etc.)\n4. Virtual production (replace green screens with giant LED walls).\n5. View-dependent effects without (traditional) shaders or lightingIt's not just about the aesthetic, it's also about interoperability, ease of use, and the entire ecosystem.",

Ganz Magyar Vagon is an Hungarian company linked with Oil oligarchs close to the Victor Orban government. The government alleged National Security reasons when the National Intelligence Center started to suspect that the operation was really funded by a Russian Company, lending money to the Hungarians, via Corvinus International Investment Ltd.https://www.ft.com/content/e3074c51-7de1-4ed4-aafd-e3c20d9be...So it seems that Moscow could be trying to gain access to the Spanish train technology for some reason.Also, this crash happened in Andalucia. On 8 January 2026 the high velocity trains in Andalucia were delayed some hours by somebody stealing small amounts of copper cable from several vital parts of the system. It was ruled as  common thievery, and it was not the first time. Similar events on may 2025:https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cm24l14l4zmoStealing copper from the Spanish railway is like an Olympic sport lately. It seems strangely common on the previous hours to a big holiday, election or major event.The problem is causing serious economic damage and lots of troubles to the users of the Spanish Commuter rail system \"Cercanias\" and now escalated also to the high speed railway. The troubles with Cercanias can be often attributed to poor maintenance, but sometimes include also somebody placing rocks and trunks directly on the railway with the mere purpose to create chaos.EU is on an hybrid war with Russia, and that there are many documented boycotts against relevant European infrastructure, like the regular cut of submarine cables.

Planning the wrong materials for the amount of traffic / weather conditions / etc.In general, when you talk about under-funding in the rail network it's often regional or small areas within the inter-city (larga distancia) and transport networks.

Humans need to look forward at the horizon to get their visual stimuli aligned with their motion/balance sense in the inner ear. If that alignment isn't there, you will get seasick. Backwards makes this even worse.Babies don't suffer from this, because closing your eyes helps, and infants don't have as strong a reaction to motions anyways, due to them usually being carried by their parents until walking age. So reverse baby seats only work for babies.",

Now they show posts that look exactly like the organic posts in your feed, just with a small \"sponsored\", \"promoted\", or \"ad\" mark somewhere. Half the time the post is large enough that it takes up my entire screen and the \"sponsored\" mark is below and off-screen.If you go on Amazon, the \"sponsored\" text is much smaller and light gray rgb(87,89,89) while the product text is near-black rgb(15,17,17).

Furthermore it's designed to be replicated, like a Git repo. Replicating the data is an inherent part of how Bluesky works. Replication is out of your control. On the bright side, it's an automatic backup.So, much like with a public git repo, you should be comfortable with the fact that anything you put there is public and will get indexed. Random people could find it in a search. Inevitably, AI will train on it. I believe you can delete stuff from your own PDS but it's effectively on your permanent record. That's just part of the deal.So, try not to put anything there that you'll regret.

If you wanted to construct a UI around these, realistically you're gonna need to know wtf you're building (it's a twitter/bluesky clone); there simply isn't enough information in the lexicons to do a good job. And the argument can't be \"hey you published a lexicon and now people can assume your data validates\", because validation isn't done on write, it's done on read. So like, there really is no difference between this and like, looking up the docs on the data format and building a client. There are no additional guarantees.Maybe there's an argument for moving towards some kind of standardization, but... do we really need that? Like are we plagued by dozens of slightly incompatible scrobbling data models? Even if we are, isn't this the job of like, an NPM library and not a globally replicated database?Anyway, I appreciate that, facially, at proto is trying to address lock in. That's not easy, and I like their solution. But I don't think that's anywhere near the biggest problem Twitter had. Just scanning the Bluesky subreddit, there's still problems like too much US politics and too many dick pics.

Platforms like Reddit and Instagram already function this way: the product is user content, the payment is attention, and the platform’s cut is ads or behavioral data. Dan argues that this structure is not inevitable. If social data is treated as something people own and store themselves, applications stop being the owners of social graphs and become interfaces that read from user-controlled data instead.I am working on a similar model for commerce. Sellers deploy their own commerce logic such as orders, carts, and payments as a hosted service they control, and marketplaces integrate directly with seller APIs rather than hosting sellers. This removes platform overhead, lowers fees, and shifts ownership back to the people creating value, turning marketplaces into interoperable discovery layers instead of gatekeepers.",

Treat everything as data blobs (inspired by PerKeep[0]) addressed by their hashes and many of the issues described in the article just aren't even a thing. If it really makes sense, or for compatibility sake, relevant blobs can be exposed through a filesystem abstraction.Also, users don't really want apps. What users want are capabilities. So not Bluesky, or YouTube for example, but the capability to easily share a life update with interested parties, or the capability to access yoga tutorial videos. The primary issue with apps is that they bundle capabilities, but many times particular combinations of capabilities are desired, which would do well to be wired together.Something in particular that's been popping up fairly often for me is I'm in a messaging app, and I'd like to lookup certain words in some of the messages, then perhaps share something relevant from it. Currently I have to copy those words over to a browser app for that lookup, then copy content and/or URL and return to the messaging app to share. What I'd really love is the capability to do lookups in the same window that I'm chatting with others. Like it'd be awesome if I could embed browser controls alongside the message bubbles with the lookup material, and optionally make some of those controls directly accessible to the other part(y|ies), which may even potentially lead to some kind of adhoc content collaboration as they make their own updates.It's time to break down all these barriers that keep us from creating personalized workflows on demand.

An \"app\" is usually a set of capabilities, not a single capability. Many of the core *nix utilities for example are specifically designed to have a single capability each, and these are then composed for complex requirements. But for the most part today's apps contain multiple, usually overlapping capabilities. For example Microsoft Word offers not only text editing and formatting, but also has a dictionary+thesaurus, spelling+grammar check, mail merge and lots more. Of course, you can abstract this all away as \"word processor capability\", but there are other word processing apps out there with varying capabilities, and so things become problematic fast especially in terms of interoperability.> OpenDoc and OLE\nThese \"never worked\" due to people/policy, not due to tech ability. OpenDoc essentially stagnated at Apple due to conflicts and lack of clarity, and then was outright killed by Steve Jobs[0]. OLE(tm) hasn't failed per se, but it's proprietary to Microsoft[1] and thus doesn't have much adoption outside Windows.> Brand names matter\nAll they really do is put a label on a bundle - or bundles - of capabilities to create handy associations. YouTube is associated primarily with accessing videos that can be made and uploaded by anyone, secondarily allows commenting on and liking said videos, etc. Again, marketing is a significant factor.> a built-in feature\nYou seem to be missing the forest for a tree here. That's a single example, of infinite permutations. Also, even given that example you're still missing parts of the flow.[0] https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OpenDoc\n[1] https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object_Linking_and_Embedding",

Just like you have group chats with different people, thats what IG and Snap are. Segmentation all the way down.I actually agree with that. See from the post:>For some use cases, like cross-site syndication, a standard-ish jointly governed lexicon makes sense. For other cases, you really want the app to be in charge. It’s actually good that different products can disagree about what a post is! Different products, different vibes. We’d want to support that, not to fight it.AT doesn't make posts from one app appear in all apps by default, or anything like that. It just makes it possible for products to interoperate where that makes sense. It is up to whoever's designing the products to decide which data from the network to show. E.g. HN would have no reason to show Instagram posts. However, if I'm making my own aggregator app, I might want to process HN stuff together with Reddit stuff. AT gives me that ability.To give you a concrete example where this makes sense. Leaflet (https://leaflet.pub/) is a macroblogging platform, but it ingests Bluesky posts to keep track of quotes from the Leaflets on the network, and display those quotes in a Leaflet's sidebar. This didn't require Leaflet and Bluesky to collaborate, it's just naturally possible.Another reason to support this is that it allows products to be \"forked\" when someone is motivated enough. Since data is on the open network, nothing is stopping from a product fork from being perfectly interoperable with the original network (meaning it both sees \"original\" data and can contribute to it). So the fork doesn't have to solve the \"convince everyone to move\" problem, it just needs to be good enough to be worth running and growing organically. This makes the space much more competitive. To give an example, Blacksky is a fork of Bluesky that takes different moderation decisions (https://bsky.app/profile/rude1.blacksky.team/post/3mcozwdhjo...) but remains interoperable with the network.",

The only time people use voice controls is when they can't use other controls, i.e. while driving. Nobody is voluntarily booking a flight with their Alexa. There's a reason every society on the planet shifted from primarily phone calls to texting once the technology was available!It's similar with vibe coding.

One is amazing, the other is pretty crappy. That's a product of both the software/interface and the model itself I'd suspect.Where I think this goes in the medium term is we will absolutely spin up our own teams of agents, probably not conforming to the silly anthropomorphized \"town\" model with mayors and polecats and so on, but they'll be specialized to particular purposes and respond to specific events within a software architecture or a project or even a business model. Currently the sky's the limit in my mind for all the possible applications of this, and a lot of it can be done with existing and fairly cheap models too, so the bottleneck is, surprise surprise... developer time! The industry won't disappear but it will increasingly revolve around orchestrating these teams of models, and software will continue to eat the world.",

If they haven't already.Personally I've had a lot of luck Opus etc with \"odd\" languages just making sure that the prompt is heavily tuned to describe best practices and reinforce descriptions of differences with \"similar\" languages. A few months ago with Sonnet 4, etc. this was dicey. Now I can run Opus 4.5 on my own rather bespoke language and get mostly excellent output. Especially when it has good tooling for verification, and reference documentation available.The downside is you use quite a bit of tokens doing this. Which is where I think fine tuning could help.I bet one of the larger airlines or banks could dump some cash over to Anthropic etc to produce a custom trained model using a corpus of banking etc software, along with tools around the backend systems and so on. Worthwhile investment.In any case I can't see how this would be a threat to people who work in those domains. They'd be absolutely invaluable to understand and apply and review and improve the output. I can imagine it making their jobs 10x more pleasant though.",

The real back-end, though, was  an old COBOL system.I remember helping the COBOL programmers debug some stuff, and it was just so wildly foreign. My degree is in theoretical comp sci, and I'd seen a lot of different languages, including Prolog, various lisps and schemes, SQL, ADA, C++, C, Pascal, various assembly variants, but COBOL was simply unique. I've often wondered what ideas COBOL got right that we could learn from and leverage today in a new language.I do remember our COBOL mainframes were really fast compared to the SQL Server layers my middle-tier services used, but I also remember looking at it and thinking it would be a giant pain to write (the numbers at the front of every line seemed like tedium that I would probably often get wrong).",

One who breaks an unjust law must do so openly, lovingly, and with a willingness to accept the penalty. I submit that an individual who breaks a law that conscience tells him is unjust, and who willingly accepts the penalty of imprisonment in order to arouse the conscience of the community over its injustice, is in reality expressing the highest respect for law.I always have to go back to read this part again because I feel like it's so unexpected.

I think a more profound point of his that’s glossed over is that you cannot simply legislate equality into existence and that framing the treatment of Blacks in the US as a ‘civil rights’ issue was a misaddress of the issue.But I think a lot of people are satisfied to settle for the appeal of what Martin and Malcolm's ideologies/methodologies represent on the surface. A matter of rhetoric, I suppose.Both men’s politics seem frozen by men of time in ways that are easy for common observers to grasp. Never mind the evolution of thought that both men experienced in the years (and in the case of Malcolm, months, practically) before their assassinations.So yeah. Riots are the voice of the unheard.

But such an ordinance becomes unjust when it is used to maintain segregation and to deny citizens the First-Amendment privilege of peaceful assembly and protest.I think that one of the great failures of our society and our government has been our willingness to allow large gaps to form between a law and its application.  We constantly hear about laws that are \"on the books but not enforced\".  We constantly pass laws to remedy perceived ills, but we don't fund or even specify enforcement mechanisms (or we make such mechanisms ineffective), so the laws just add to the pile of unpaid promissory notes that King refers to in another famous passage.  (Ironically the civil rights legislation that King fought for is an example of this.)I also wonder what King would say if we could ask him today about what he says here.  In the situation he describes, is it really the ordinance itself that becomes unjust, or can it be that the ordinance itself remains just while it is the enforcement process itself that is unjust?We seem too content to allow decisions about the provisions of a law to be separated from decisions about how those provisions are implemented; we allow innumerable people (e.g., police officers) discretion to make their own decisions about what the law means.

It's nice to be re-examine it every few years and to notice new details that come with the perspective of recent events.I'm, of course, grateful to Dr King for writing it, but also to the history teacher 25 years ago who decided to include it in the curriculum. When we're surrounded by self re-enforcing authority, it's takes individuals with courage to choose to share texts like these and its effect is appreciated.",

I have almost reached the regrettable conclusion that the Negro's great stumbling block in his stride toward freedom is not the White Citizen's Counciler or the Ku Klux Klanner, but the white moderate, who is more devoted to \"order\" than to justice; who prefers a negative peace which is the absence of tension to a positive peace which is the presence of justice; who constantly says: \"I agree with you in the goal you seek, but I cannot agree with your methods of direct action\"; who paternalistically believes he can set the timetable for another man's freedom; who lives by a mythical concept of time and who constantly advises the Negro to wait for a \"more convenient season.\" Shallow understanding from people of good will is more frustrating than absolute misunderstanding from people of ill will. Lukewarm acceptance is much more bewildering than outright rejection.What MLK is talking about how the \"white moderate\" sides with the oppressors by defending the status quo and choosing \"order\" over progress.This is the exact schism that currently exists in the Democratic Party today. If you pay attention to American politics, you'll probably have an idea that there is a civil war within the Democratic Party between \"liberals\" and \"leftists\". \"Liberals\", the same \"white moderates\", defend American imperialism, want to put a smiley face on ICE rather than abolishing it and basically just want to be \"Republican lite\".These policies are deeply unpoular with the base, such the the net approval of the Democratic Party is at historic lows [1]. This isn't incompetence. It's a choice to favor the donor class and their future job prospects over the interests of their base.A lot of these \"white moderates\" today get angry at leftists (way more than at Republicans, ironically) for being \"single issue voters\" about Palestine since that's now become a litmus test for candidates in primary season. First, they don't understand what a single issue voter actually is. Second, and more importantly, there's not a single politician who has a good stance on racial justice and equality, women's rights and so on that has a bad position on Palestine. There is a refusal to see how these things are interconnected.[1]: https://civiqs.com/results/favorable_democrats?uncertainty=t...",

I am glad to see his writing appear on HN.One concept which has pervaded my thinking recently due to personal circumstance is of forgiveness. I tend towards 'forgive but not forget'; I don't feel particularly attached to the past, but neither am I willing to let go of it. In one of his speeches [0] he addresses this directly.He says that forgiving but not forgetting is not true forgiveness; but neither should you ignore one's past transgressions. Forgiveness is being willing to forge a new relationship. Not one built on history, but independent of it. The willingness to give a fresh start to those who seek it.Another, more well-known idea he spoke of (that folks here are likely familiar with) is that of hate only adding to hate. I'll just leave his words here directly:> The ultimate weakness of violence is that it is a descending spiral begetting the very thing it seeks to destroy. Instead of diminishing evil, it multiplies it. Through violence you may murder the liar, but you cannot murder the lie, nor establish the truth. Through violence you may murder the hater, but you do not murder hate. In fact, violence merely increases hate. Returning violence for violence multiplies violence, adding deeper darkness to a night already devoid of stars. Darkness cannot drive out darkness; only light can do that. Hate cannot drive out hate; only love can do that.[0] https://kinginstitute.stanford.edu/king-papers/documents/lov...",

They were, in the most credible way, refusing to accept endless delay.This allowed them to shift the baseline of what was politically tolerable.In that sense, the movements worked collectively because of a kind of good-cop/bad-cop dynamic. MLK JR offered a path to reform that felt (to some) constructive and legitimate _because_ there was a visible alternative that many people udnerstood as worse.I think violence is already far to prominent today, but I think successful movements do need both moral persuasion (if morality is still a thing that persuades) and _also_ a credible way of making inaction feel unsafe.",

I would suggest though a lot of this is just cope for the fact that people are learning they aren't fit for their heros, they don't belong in the same room let alone the same building. It's easy to valorize King when he's a voice from the past. The people who stay home today are the same who stayed home then. The American revolution was really instigated by a minority of the colonial population. Most people stay home.It's just a basic fact of humanity  - most people are cowards, and that is probably fine.

We made the deliberate architectural choice to develop and optimize our storage and sync engine to drive the marginal cost of a free workspace down to near-zero.Because our cost basis is structurally lower than competitors carrying legacy tech debt or generic cloud overhead, we can afford to treat the free tier as a sustainable on-ramp rather than a loss leader that bleeds us dry.",

      "abstract": "该讨论围绕预测市场的财富转移微观结构展开，核心话题是预测市场（如Kalshi平台）的实际运作机制及其潜在问题。社区观点多元：有人认为预测市场的主要风险并非普通赌徒亏损，而是为有权势者提供了操纵结果的渠道，例如裁判操控比赛或内部人士利用信息不对称获利。也有用户指出平台存在明显的“长尾偏差”，低概率合约被系统性高估，导致流动性接受者蒙受损失。讨论中还提到，部分市场活动可能被用于“广告式投注”以影响公众认知，或存在大量自动化交易脚本的参与。用户普遍对预测市场的赌博本质表示担忧，认为其宣传常误导用户，且缺乏监管。分歧点在于：一方强调市场操纵和内部交易的风险，另一方则关注市场效率偏差和技术因素（如手续费结构）的影响。整体上，社区对预测市场持批判态度，认为其常被包装成投资工具，但实质仍接近赌博，并可能加剧财富不平等。",

Its the fact that it gives very powerful people a vehicle to make lobsided bets on outcomes they control.A small example of this would be NFL / NBA Refs fixing playoff games with a bad call or two. This actually happened 20 years ago, an NBA ref went to prison over being bribed just $2000 per game.The much worse example is the fact that you can make 100-1 odds on whether the US airstrikes Iran today... or How many times Pam Bondi says the word \"China\" in a press conference.",

          "content": "The analysis is interesting, but I think it ignores a few factors:1. The article mentions the bid/ask spread for contracts, but I believe that Kalshi also has its own fee structure.  Small edges (an expected loss of 0.57¢ on a 1¢ contract implies an expected gain of 0.43¢ on a 99¢ contract, or a 5.75ppt edge) can be easily eaten by even small fees, and liquidity provision is all about small edges.2. The article ignores the time value of money, and contracts take time to resolve.  If a contract won't resolve for six months and the risk-free rate is 5%, then buying a \"sure thing\" over 97.5¢ is a loss net of otherwise earnable interest.3. Long shots offer greater implied leverage to bettors, making them more attractive.  This is still (sometimes) an exploitable mispricing, but it's closer to the well-understood \"bet against beta\" factor.(Edit to add) Also, I think their explanation of the non-returns on finance is lacking:> Why is Finance efficient? The likely explanation is participant selection; financial questions attract traders who think in probabilities and expected values rather than fans betting on their favorite team or partisans betting on a preferred candidate. The questions themselves are dry (\"Will the S&P close above 6000?\"), which filters out emotional bettors.Financial contracts are the ones that are most perfectly hedges with existing markets.  \"Will the S&P close above X?\" is a binary option, after all, so it's comparatively easy for a market-maker to almost perfectly offset their Kalshi positions with opposite positions in traditional markets.",

Impressive to see this being done in pure C.I'm the maintainer of MFLUX (https://github.com/filipstrand/mflux) which does a similar thing, but at a higher level using the MLX framework optimised for Apple Silicon. I just merged Flux 2 Klein support as well and was happy to see this discussion :)I started out doing this type of work roughly 1.5 years ago when FLUX.1 was released and have been doing it off and on ever since with newer models, trying to use more and more AI over time.At one point, I vibe-coded a debugger to help the coding agent along. It worked OK but as models have gotten stronger, this doesn't really seem to be needed anymore. My latest version simply has a SKILL.md that outlines my overall porting strategy (https://github.com/filipstrand/mflux/blob/main/.cursor/skill...). Somewhat surprisingly, this actually works now with Cursor + Codex-5.2, with little human intervention.> Even if the code was generated using AI, my help in steering towards the right design, implementation choices, and correctness has been vital during the development.This definitely resonates! Curious to hear more about what worked/didn't for you. A couple of things I've found useful:- Porting the pipeline backwards: This is the way I did it personally before using any coding models. The typical image generation flow is the following:1.Text_encodings (+ random_noise_latent)\n2.Transformer loop \n3.VAE decodingI found that by starting with the VAE first (by feeding it pre-loaded tensors from the reference extracted at specific locations) it was the quickest way to get to an actual generated image. Once the VAE is done and verified, only then proceed backwards the chain and handle the Transformer, etc. I still prefer to do it this way and I like to manually intervene between step 3,2 and 1, but maybe this won't actually be needed soon?- Also, with the VAE, if you care about implementing the encoding functionality (e.g to be used with img2img features), the round-trip test is a very quick way to verify correctness:image_in -> encode -> decode -> image_out : compare(image_in, image_out)- Investing in a good foundation for weight handling, especially when doing repeat work across similar models.

I have a long time passion about AI, I wrote my first NN implementation in 2003 (used here, many years ago, as a showcase of Redis modules https://github.com/antirez/neural-redis), and never stopped since there to implement, for fun, small GPT models and things like that, using PyTorch or C.Also my work at Redis Vector Sets, in the latest year, exposed me more to working with models (especially text embedding models of many kinds, but also other models).So while Claude was fundamental to get the implementation fast, I had background to have idea about what was happening in the different stages. I believe it is a very interesting question to understand if this kind of work can be made with programming background and near-zero AI background. My feeling is that you ned more time, more back and forth, maybe to provide the agent with more examples, but eventually it will do something working.",

In this case the agent worked only using the reference code provided by Flux's Black Forest Labs which is basically just the pipeline implemented as a showcase. The fundamental way for this process to work is that the agent can have a feedback to understand if it is really making progresses, and to debug failures against a reference implementation. But then all the code was implemented with many implementation hints about what I wanted to obtain, and without any reference of other minimal inference libraries or kernels. So I believe this just is the effect of putting together known facts about how Transformers inference works plus an higher level idea of how software should appear to the final user. Btw today somebody took my HNSW implementation for vector sets and translated it to Swift (https://github.com/jkrukowski/swift-hnsw). I'm ok with that, nor I care of this result was obtained with AI or not. However it is nice that the target license is the same, given the implementation is so similar to the C one.",

CNAMEs are name level aliases, not record level, so this \"feature\" would break the caching of NS, MX, and SOA records that exist at domain apexes. Many of us warned them at the time that this would result in a non-deterministic issue. At EC2 and Route 53 we weren't supporting this just to be mean! If a user's DNS resolver got an MX query before an A query, things might work ... but the other way around, they might not. An absolute nightmare to deal with.

But even if the RFC had said “associated with a particular combination of name, type, and class”, I don’t see how that could have introduced ambiguity. It specifies an exception to a general rule, so obviously if the exception doesn’t apply, then the general rule must be followed.Anyway, Cloudflare probably know their DNS better than I do, but I did not find the article especially persuasive; I think the ambiguity is actually just a misreading, and that the RFC does require a particular ordering of CNAME records.(ETA:) Although admittedly, while the RFC does say that CNAMEs must come before As in the answer, I don’t necessarily see any clear rule about how CNAME chains must be ordered; the RFC just says “Domain names in RRs which point at another name should always point at the primary name and not the alias ... Of course, by the robustness principle, domain software should not fail when presented with CNAME chains or loops; CNAME chains should be followed”.

Most in-process stub resolvers (including the glibc one) do not implement a DNS cache, so they presently do not have a need to implement such a data structure.

If that's indeed the case, I can easily imagine how noone noticed anything was broken. First look at this line:> Most DNS clients don’t have this issue. For example, systemd-resolved first parses the records into an ordered set:Now think about what real end user devices are using: Windows/macOS/iOS obviously aren't using glibc and Android also has its own C library even though it's Linux-based, and they all probably fall under the \"Most DNS clients don't have this issue.\".That leaves GNU/Linux, where we could reasonably expect most software to use glibc for resolving queries, so presumably anyone using Linux on their laptop would catch this right? Except most distributions started using systemd-resolved (most notable exception is Debian, but not many people use that on desktops/laptops), which is a locally-cached recursive DNS server, and as such acts as a middleman between glibc software and the network configured DNS server, so it would resolve 1.1.1.1 queries correctly, and then return the results from its cache ordered by its own ordering algorithm.",

      "abstract": "该讨论围绕使用大型语言模型辅助电路设计的可行性与方法展开。核心争议在于LLM在电路设计中的实际能力边界。有用户认为，LLM的真正优势在于元件选型与集成，而非创新设计，并分享了采用预验证电路模块的项目思路。也有用户指出，对于经验丰富的工程师，LLM能有效提升生产力，帮助生成框图、查找元件；但新手同样可通过仿真工具和产品信息建立高质量反馈循环。讨论中提到，LLM在解读数据手册方面表现较好（评级A-），但在检查电路图错误或网表时效果不稳定（评级C）。部分用户分享了结合树莓派、ESP-32等硬件进行编程与调试的实践经验。普遍共识是，当前LLM更适合作为辅助工具，在已有知识或验证工具配合下发挥作用，而不应独立承担全新电路设计。分歧主要集中在对LLM“设计能力”的界定：一方认为要求其进行新颖设计本身是误用；另一方则认为这恰恰暴露了LLM在电路领域的根本局限。",

          "content": "Been working on this exact problem for a while now. The core issue isn't that LLMs are bad at circuits, it's that we're asking them to do novel design when they should be doing selection and integration.My project (https://phaestus.app/blog) takes a different approach: pre-validated circuit blocks on a fixed 12.7mm grid with standardized bus structures. The LLM picks which blocks you need and where they go, but the actual circuit design was done by humans and tested. No hallucinated resistor values, no creative interpretations of datasheets.It's the same insight that made software dependencies work. You don't ask ChatGPT to write you a JSON parser from scratch, you ask it which library to use. Hardware should work the same way.Still WIP and the block library needs expanding, but the constraint-based approach means outputs are manufacturable by construction rather than \"probably fine, let's see what catches fire.\"",

          "content": "I've been vibe circuit building since the 1970s, but that's not what this is about, is it?  ;-)Years ago, at Pumping Station One in Chicago, I watched someone struggle with the driving of multiple LEDs from an Arduino in his project. He wondered why the LEDs got dimmer when more than one was lit.I looked at the original schematic, and what he had built, and noticed a difference. The original design had a resistor on each LED, but he had decided that was a redundancy and refactored it to use a single LED instead. In the case of current flow, this meant the circuit still worked, but that current limiting that resistor provided now was shared across every active LED, leading to the progressive dimming as more LEDs were active.It turned out his background was in software, where the assumptions are much different as to what is important. Cutting out redundant code is an important skill.I saw it as a cognitive impedance mismatch being played out in real life.I assume the same is true for an LLM/AI attempting the same leap.",

Probably not). Fine for prototyping/hobby stuff/one off but falls apart quickly in production.Still, having working prototype quickly that can then be optimized in more traditional way can still be very valuable.> It's the same insight that made software dependencies work. You don't ask ChatGPT to write you a JSON parser from scratch, you ask it which library to use. Hardware should work the same way.hardware optimising gets you far more money faster than software, because the cost of software not being optimal is mostly cost on the consumer (burning more CPU than it would if it was optimized), while for hardware each chip less is more money left in your pocket and there are actual size constraints that can be pretty hard edged vs software's \"well the user will have to download extra MB more\"",

      "abstract": "该帖子讨论了一种名为MTOTP的新型双因素认证方案，其核心在于将用户自身作为认证设备，通过心算生成动态验证码。社区对此反应不一，争议主要集中在方案是否真正符合双因素认证的定义。\n\n有用户指出，该方案本质上是“已知信息加心算劳动”，应归类为密码而非真正的双因素认证，因为双因素认证要求证明用户物理持有某个设备。也有用户认为这类似于手动对密码进行时间盐值哈希，与TOTP机制关联性不强。讨论中提到，若用户能在胁迫下直接输出验证码，则其安全性等同于会轮换的密码，失去了设备持有的保护意义。\n\n部分用户肯定其创新性，认为这是人机可计算TOTP的有趣实验，虽不适用于生产环境，但为提升日常双因素认证安全性提供了思路。同时存在担忧，如普通用户可能难以理解流程，转而使用不安全的第三方应用存储密钥，反而造成信息泄露。此外，有用户对方案中第六位校验码的必要性提出疑问，认为其未增强安全性。\n\n整体而言，社区普遍认同该方案在概念上具有探索价值，但对其安全属性和实际可用性存在明显分歧。",

          "content": "What makes this 2FA? It's \"something you know, plus mental labor\", which makes it a password.2FA is \"something you have\" (or \".. you are\", for biometrics): it is supposed to prove that you currently physically posses the single copy of a token. The textbook example is a TOTP stored in a Yubikey.Granted, this has been watered down a lot by the way-too-common practice of storing TOTP secrets in password managers, but that's how it is supposed to work.Does your mTOTP prove you own the single copy? No, you could trivially tell someone else the secret key. Does it prove that you currently own it? No, you can pre-calculate a verification token for future use.I still think it is a very neat idea on paper, but I'm not quite seeing the added value. The obvious next step is to do all the math in client-side code and just have the user enter the secret - doing this kind of mental math every time you log in is something only the most hardcore nerds get excited about.",

Repetition and redundancy, ambiguity, illogical ordering of content, rambling sentences, opaque grammar. That should not be surprising. Writing clear prose is a skill that most people do not have, and Wikipedia articles are generally the fruit of collaboration without copy editors.AI is perfectly suited to fixing this problem. I recently spent several hours rewriting a somewhat important article. I did not add or subtract information from the article, I simply made it clearer and more concise. I came away convinced that AI could have done as good a job - with supervision, of course - in a fraction of the time. AI-assisted copy-editing is not against Wikipedia rules. Yet as things stand, there are no built-in tools to facilitate it, doubtless because of the ambient suspicion of AI as a technology. We need to take a smarter approach.",

It's the language itself that is problematic, not how the text itself came to be, so makes sense to 100% target what language the text is.Hopefully those guidelines make all text on Wikipedia better, not just LLM produced ones, because they seem like generally good guidelines even outside the context of LLMs.",

Leveraging openly available data, we show that half of the research published in top journals has disclosable ties to industry in the form of prior funding, collaboration, or employment. However, the majority of these ties go undisclosed in the published research. These trends do not arise from broad scientific engagement with industry, but rather from a select group of scientists who maintain long-lasting relationships with industry. Undisclosed ties to industry are common not just among authors, but among reviewers and academic editors during manuscript evaluation. Further, industry-tied research garners more attention within the academy, among policymakers, on social media, and in the news. Finally, we find evidence that industry ties are associated with a topical focus away from impacts of platform-scale features. Together, these findings suggest industry influence in social media research is extensive, impactful, and often opaque. Going forward there is a need to strengthen disclosure norms and implement policies to ensure the visibility of independent research, and the integrity of industry supported research. \"",

And why many historians find it good but suboptimal and why e.g. the approach to free speech was revisited when drafting the west German constitution instead of just more or less copying the US constitution (the US but also France, UK had some say in the drafting of it, it was originally meant to be temporary until reunification, but in the end was mostly kept verbatim during unification as it worked out quite well).",

The problem is, the blacks are much more washed-out because that light still has to go somewhere, so it's basically just being smeared across the entire display.This page shows lots of side-by-side photos of content that is primarily white, and most of the black bits (like text) are too small to make out.The comparison needs to use things like busy photographs with bright areas and black areas. Then you can judge how much more washed-out the black areas look.The second photo makes the Nano texture look pretty washed-out, but sadly doesn't include the traditional glossy laptop next to it for comparison, so it's impossible to tell.Also, in all the side-by-side photos the Nano screen looks like it's set to much brighter. So any fair comparison should have them set to equal brightness. There's no universe in which a glossy screen is going to make the white areas look darker, as they are in all these examples.I'm very curious if/how the Nano is better, but unfortunately these photos don't do anything to demonstrate it.",

If I shared his bone fides, it would out him, but suffice to say we had a chat about the XDR screen one time, mainly in comparison to the Dell, and he uses Windows while I use a Mac or Linux. With the utter confidence of someone who has better things to think about he said \"Oh, the texture is created by exposing it to hydrofluoric acid. That's just the only way you do this.\" And then went back to talking about the lack of physical controls, which is what ultimately led him to buy the Dell.All that to say, this Jon.Bo statement \"Basically, it’s a coating\" is false. It's not a coating. When you're looking at a nanotexture screen, you're just looking through glass.Since I'm sure someone will challenge me, I looked it up. Here's Apple's patent: https://patents.google.com/patent/US20220326413A1/enand the key section from paragraph 0117:\"The surface of the glass cover member may then be chemically etched. Chemical etching techniques for glass cover members may involve using a suitable acid or base (e.g., a hydrofluoric acid-based etchant)\".I love their little redirections, like \"a suitable acid or base\".Also: don't try this at home kids.

Borderline useless if the screen isn’t bright enough to outshine the strong glare covering 40-60%+ of the screen.",

My partner's family's go-to surface spray has always been a home-made mix of ~30% methylated spirits to water. That's the only bench spray I've used for 10+ years and I can report it's as effective as any commercial spray, and 10% the price. Just mix it at home and use it everywhere. Kitchen, bathroom, anywhere else. I speak as a clean-freak. It works.It's also amazing for cleaning laptop screens. I spray it directly on. I shouldn't. I do. I type this on a 5-year-old Macbook Air whose screen has been cleaned countless times using this method. It looks like this. (The moon-surface-like texture at the top is the texture of the reflected wall, above.) https://share.cleanshot.com/bnHrCQDZ1. Make this mixture in a $1 spray bottle at home.2. Lock your laptop and press Escape so the screen turns off. Lay it screen-back-down, keyboard open at about 80°, so it sits on the bench.3. Spray a small amount of this mixture on the screen, directly. But don't be shy. Just don't have the screen be swimming.4. Wipe carefully with a kitchen towel.5. Repeat as necessary.So far the only danger I've found is catching an abrasive particle in the cloth in the wiping process. A pre-wipe can alleviate the issue.",

          "content": "Adrian Tchaikovsky is really good at these alien ecosystems kind of thing (his Children of * range being quite good). This was a terrific short story. One thing I am curious about is whether there is a different kind of science fiction out there. The driving thread through all of modern English sci-fi is \"we shouldn't go out there and do anything; we are the bad that ruins a delicate thing\". That's a cool story but somewhat overly tropey at this point I think. This short story, the Avatar series, they have this ecological moralizing. AT is creative enough that the novel ideas (single species life-cycle planet) carry the tale even though the moral thread is the same as the Avatar movie: corporations destroy ecosystems they don't understand in the resource pursuit.I enjoy the \"what if we're the baddies\" just as much as anyone else. But are there big stories with these exciting concepts where we aren't the baddies in the Anglosphere?A thing I enjoy about other cultures is seeing what is unusually different about them. In the Three Body Problem, spoilers to follow for the series, humanity aren't The Bad Guys With Agency. We aren't even The Big Bad or The Big Good. We're sort of just other participants in this universe. The dual vector foil is employed by someone else, the guys who want space back from the pocket dimension to reboot the universe are just someone else, everything is someone else. We are bit part players in this play.This goes on even to a few movies. The Wandering Earth movie (somewhat different from the short story) has this part at the end (obvious spoilers to follow) where the heroes accomplish the task and reboot their Earth Engine after conquering all odds - only for the camera to zoom out and show numerous other teams also having done the same. This wasn't the only struggle won. Cool alternative tale where it isn't so much One Team Saves The World or One Team Ruins The World.",

          "content_cn": "阿德里安·柴科夫斯基确实擅长描绘这类外星生态系统（他的《*之子》系列就相当出色）。这篇短篇小说非常精彩。我好奇的是，是否还存在另一种不同的科幻作品。现代英语科幻的核心主题往往是“我们不该去外界做任何事；我们是破坏脆弱之物的恶徒”。这种叙事很酷，但我觉得如今已有些陈词滥调。这篇短篇小说和《阿凡达》系列都带有这种生态说教。柴科夫斯基的创造力足以用新颖的设定（单一物种生命周期的星球）支撑故事，尽管其道德主线与《阿凡达》电影如出一辙：企业为追求资源摧毁了他们不理解的生态系统。\n\n我和大家一样喜欢“如果我们是反派”的设定。但英语世界里是否存在这样的大型故事：拥有激动人心的概念，而我们并非反派？我欣赏其他文化的一点，是能看到它们非同寻常的差异。在《三体》系列中（以下含剧透），人类并非掌握主动权的恶徒。我们甚至不是终极反派或救世主。我们只是宇宙中的参与者之一。二向箔是他人使用的武器，那些想从微观维度取回空间以重启宇宙的也只是其他存在，一切皆由他人主导。我们不过是这出戏里的小角色。\n\n这种倾向甚至延续到一些电影中。《流浪……》"

Very nice.Also he does love his evil, totalitarian states. Here it's the Concern. In Alien Clay it's the Mandate. I think his name for the philosophy in his Tyrant Philosophers series is very clever: Perfection.

User asks for something2. Agent can't do it, so it creates a CLI3. Next time it's aware of the CLI and uses it. If the user asks for something it can't do it either improves the CLI it made, or creates a new CLI.4. Each interaction results in updated/improved toolkits for the things you ask it for.You as the user can use all these CLIs as well which ends up an interesting side-channel way of interacting with the agent (you add a todo using the same CLI as what it uses for example).It's also incredibly flexible, yesterday I made a \"coding agent\" by having it create tools to inspect/analyze/edit a codebase and it could go off and do most things a coding agent can.https://github.com/caesarnine/binsmith",

I'm probably going to add command filtering on what can be run under vterm (so it can't exit back to an initial shell), which will help unless/until I add a \"!<script>\" style command to my TUI, in which case I'm sure it'll find and exploit that instead.",

The only native mammal here is a bat, we have mostly birds which evolved for a really long time with only avian predators. So they’re hilariously poorly adapted for surviving standard predators (cats, rats, dogs etc) which first the Maori and subsequently Europeans brought. For example, many of them are flightless and tend to freeze when threatened - works well against eagles but is a terrible idea when threatened by a cat.As a result, we have many animals, mostly birds, which are totally unique and also critically endangered. Many of them can only survive on offshore islands which have been comprehensively cleared of predators at vast effort and expense. The islands need to be relatively accessible since humans have to get to them to maintain them, but it turns out that once in a while a predator will swim quite vast distances for no apparent reason, and it only takes one to mess up years of painstaking work. Quite apart from killing a bunch of birds whose total remaining numbers might range from the tens to the hundreds of individuals.",

The equilibrium that established the ecosystem dynamics in the first place is disrupted.

Distance from mainland and species diversity is very strongly correlated reflecting increasingly scarce odds of these \"heroic journeys\" at greater distances. Species themselves are capable of exhausting an islands resources and putting themselves into local extinction even with no human intervention (such as the case of the last of the mammoths on wrangel island).",

      "abstract": "该讨论围绕一项研究结论展开，核心话题是“美国关税实际上由美国消费者承担”。多数用户认为这一结论显而易见，关税本质是进口税，成本最终会转嫁给国内民众。有人认为企业最初承担了主要压力，但无法持续消化，必将通过涨价转移给消费者；也有用户指出这与公司税类似，只是征收方式不同。讨论中提到部分用户对帖子被标记表示不满，质疑平台管理存在偏见。同时，有用户延伸至政治批评，认为支持者常为明显不利政策辩护，而另一些用户则以讽刺方式表达对政策效果的无奈。整体上，社区对关税负担由美国人支付这一点存在普遍共识，但在政治立场和平台管理问题上存在明显分歧。",

          "content": "> who did you think would pay?The general premise of tariffs is that a foreign product costs e.g. $100 whereas a domestic product costs $120. If you then put a 50% tariff on the foreign product, it would cost $150, and then people would prefer the domestic product and only be paying 20% instead of 50%. Moreover, they might prefer the domestic product in general (e.g. higher quality and/or patriotism) and only buy the foreign product if it's actually less expensive, and then the foreign manufacturer would have to lower their price from $100 to $70 so that the tariff only raises the price to $105 because any higher price than that and they lose the business.The result, in theory, is that you would pay $5 more rather than $50 more. Meanwhile the government collected $35 in tariffs on the foreign product, $30 of which came from the manufacturer rather than you, and that allows the government to lower your other taxes by $35 at the same level of government spending and borrowing.There are essentially two things required for this to work in your favor on net: 1) the tariffs cause the foreign manufacturer to lower their pre-tariff prices at all, and 2) the government uses the tariff revenue instead of some other taxes they would have collected directly or indirectly from you, so that your net tax burden stays the same. It can also be some mix of these, e.g. the foreign manufacturer lowers their price by $10, you pay $15 in tariffs and get a $10 reduction in other taxes, and then you're ahead by $5.Ironically, the primary way domestic taxpayers end up paying more is if the tariffs succeed in causing people to buy domestic products, because then there is no tariff revenue on the domestic products and people pay the higher price for the domestic products without a reduction in other taxes.",

          "content": "Problems with this study...Short Time Horizon for Data Analysis: The study relies on data from January 2024 to November 2025, covering only about 7-8 months after the April 2025 tariff announcements. This captures primarily short-run effects, where pass-through to import prices is often high (near 100%), but longer-term adjustments could lead to greater absorption by foreign exporters. For instance, studies of the 2018-2019 trade war, such as Amiti, Redding, and Weinstein (NBER Working Paper 26610, 2019), found that initial pass-through was complete but declined over time in sectors like steel (falling to around 50% after a year). The Kiel analysis may overstate long-term incidence on U.S. buyers by not accounting for delayed responses like supply chain reorganization or price negotiations.Incomplete Data Coverage: The dataset from Panjiva includes only ocean-freight shipments (over 25.6 million transactions valued at $4 trillion), excluding air and land imports. This omission could bias results, as air freight often involves higher-value goods with different pricing dynamics, and land imports (e.g., from Mexico or Canada) might respond differently to tariffs. Broader U.S. import data from sources like the Census Bureau show that ocean freight accounts for a significant but not comprehensive share of trade, potentially skewing estimates of overall pass-through.Reliance on Unit Values as Price Proxies: Import prices are measured as unit values (value per kg), which can be confounded by changes in product quality, mix, or shipping costs rather than true price adjustments. The authors acknowledge this as a potential issue and use validations like Indian FOB export data, but critics of similar studies (e.g., in the 2018-2019 trade war analyses by the U.S. International Trade Commission) note that unit values often overestimate pass-through by not distinguishing between price changes and compositional shifts. This could inflate the estimated 96% pass-through rate.Weak Statistical Significance in Key Estimates: The baseline regression coefficient (β = -0.039) indicating 96% pass-through is only statistically significant at the 10% level, which is below conventional thresholds (5% or 1%) in economic research. This suggests the result may not be robust to minor specification changes or data noise, raising questions about the reliability of the claim that exporters absorb less than 4% of the burden.Aggregation Masks Heterogeneity: The study reports an aggregate pass-through estimate but does not break it down sufficiently by product, country, or sector. Research on prior tariffs (e.g., Fajgelbaum et al., NBER Working Paper 25638, 2019) shows significant variation: undifferentiated goods like commodities may see more exporter absorption, while differentiated consumer goods exhibit fuller pass-through. By pooling data, the analysis may overlook these differences, leading to overly generalized conclusions.Focus on Border Prices Without Retail Pass-Through Analysis: The paper examines pass-through at the border (to importers) but extrapolates to consumers bearing \"nearly all the cost\" without direct evidence on retail prices. Studies like Cavallo et al. (NBER Working Paper 26396, 2019) and the Federal Reserve Bank of Boston (Working Paper 19-12, 2019) find that while border pass-through is near-complete, retail pass-through is partial (around 50-80%), with retailers absorbing some costs through reduced margins. This gap could mean the study overstates the ultimate burden on end consumers, ignoring supply chain buffers.",

All Governments across the World have undergone similar crisis in their own Countries, in different points in time in their own history, and know well to differentiate an erratic Government from its populace. I bet no one has ill-will towards Americans (unless you are into terrorism) and so will obviously want to mend ways once a better admin is elected and put in place.The issue really though is not about political goodwill. It is about business that gets moved elsewhere. Once moved, it is really hard to bring it back. So US will then have to make a lot of concessions when it comes to that. The reason rest of the World is upset with the new tariff regime is not because they are being affected by it monetarily (which they actually are not), but because they do not want to sever a well established system and go looking for new buyers/sellers. For example, China decided to stop buying soybeans from US (after Trump threatened tariffs) and switched to buying from Argentina. Now once a new US admin is in place, it will have to give a better deal for China to switch its already established supply chain with Argentina to US again. Inertia is a good thing in trade. Infact, I feel it is even more important than building a moat. People are willing to continue paying higher price (even if something cheap is available elsewhere) because they do not want to go through the hassle of moving away from already established supply-chains and renegotiate new deals.> really unpopular measures to clean up the messAgreed.> Once those are running there's no incentive to look at US ones againThey will if US comes with better deals. This is the \"unpopular measures to clean up the mess\" you were pointing to earlier. Right now there is a mismatch between what US is actually worth and what it is projecting. I am not saying it is not a superpower anymore. It still very much is. But it is failing to recognize the rise of great powers in the rest of the World. And is unable to reconcile with multi-polarity that has already arrived and exists. As long as US is in denial of this reality, it will continue to make mistakes.> And any geopolitical influence that was lost will already have been filled by other players who will entrench themselvesI agree but I'll go further and argue that the Trump admin is behaving erratically because it has realized it has lost geopolitical influence and that other players have already entrenched themselves. Trump has diagnozed the problem correctly (that US has lost its hegemony in many areas) but has no expertise (or even experts around him) to advice him on the right course of action.",

          "content": "Appropriate feedback is critical for good long horizon performance. The direction of feedback doesn't necessarily have to be from autonomous tools back to the LLM. It can also flow from tools to humans who then iterate the prompt / tools accordingly.I've recently discovered that if a model gets stuck in a loop on a tool call across many different runs, it's almost certainly because of a gap in expectations regarding what the available tools do in that context, not some random model failure mode.For example, I had a tool called \"GetSceneOverview\" that was being called as expected and then devolved into looping. Once I counted how many times it was looping I realized it was internally trying to pass per-item arguments in a way I couldn't see from outside the OAI API black box. I had never provided a \"GetSceneObjectDetails\" method (or explanation for why it doesn't exist) so it tried the next best thing foreach item returned in the overview.I went one step further and asked the question \"can the LLM just directly tell me what the tooling expectation gap is?\" And sure enough it can. If you provide the model with a ReportToolIssue tool, you'll start to get these insights a lot more directly. Once I had cleared non-trivial reports of tool concerns, the looping issues all but vanished. It was catching things I simply couldn't see. The best insight was the fact that I hadn't provided parent ids for each scene object (I assumed not relevant for my test command), so it was banging its head on those tools trying to figure out the hierarchy. I didn't realize how big a problem this was until I saw it complaining about it every time I ran the experiment.",

You can't trust a code not tested, and you can't read every line of code, it would be like walking a motorcycle. So tests (back pressure, deterministic feedback) become essential. You only know something works as good as its tests show.What we often like to do in a PR - look over the code and say \"LGTM\" - I call this \"vibe testing\" and think it is the real bad pattern to use with AI. You can't commit your eyes on the git repo, and you are probably not doing as good of a job as when you have actual test coverage. LGTM is just vibes. Automating tests removes manual work from you too, not just make the agent more reliable.But my metaphor for tests is \"they are the skin of the agent\", allow it to feel pain. And the docs/specs are the \"bones\", allow it to have structure. The agent itself is the muscle and cerebellum, and the human in the loop is the PFC.",

Going to provide a simple example with Claude Codes.I have a frontend agent instructed to not use any class or style ever, only the design system components and primitives.Not only it will ignore those very quickly, but when it proposes edits and I give feedback the agent ignores them completely and instead it keeps suggesting more edits.Thus I had to revert to deleting the agent completely and rely on the main thread for doing that work.Same applies with any other agent.",

So in practice those rules are often triggered in a review step pre-commit as a failsafe, rather than pulled in as context when the agent initially drafts the work.I've only played for a few minutes, but converting some of these to custom lint rules looks quite promising!Things like using my project's wrappers instead of direct calls to libs, preferences for logging/observability/testing, indicators of failure to follow optimistic update patterns, double-checking that frontend interface to specific capabilities are correctly guarded by owner/SKU access control…Lots of use cases that aren't hard for an agent to accurately fix if pointed at directly, and now that pointing can happen inline to the agent work loop without intervention through normal lint cleanup, occurring earlier in the process (and faster) than is caught by tests. This doesn't replace testing or other best practices. It feels like an additive layer that speeds up agent iteration and improves implementation consistency.Thanks for the tip!",
