Sending thank you from an ML model is anything but respectful.

Some, like my mom, got a little bit more, but some got a monthly increase around 2 PLN (about $0.5). At that point, it feels like a slap in the face. A thank you from AI gives the same vibe.",

If you find your copyright violated on a large scale on Amazon, your recourse effectively is to first go beg Amazon for information on sellers (which they have a strong incentive not to provide) and then go run international court cases, which is very hard, very expensive, and in many cases (China, India) totally unf人工智能r. If you get poisoned from a pill your national insurance bought from India, they consider themselves not responsible.Of course, this makes \"competition\" effectively a tax-dodging competition over time. And the fault for that lies entirely with the choice of your own government.Your statement about incorrect application only makes sense if \"regulatory regimes\" aren't really just people. Go visit your government offices, you'll find they're full of people. People who purposefully made a choice in this matter.A choice to enforce l亚马逊云服务 ag人工智能nst small entities they can easily bully, and to not do it on a larger scale.To add insult to injury, you will find these choices were almost never made by parliaments, but in international treaties and larger organizations like the WTO, or executive powers of large trade blocks."

Even if you disagree, I think \"without good reasons\" is overly dismissive.Personally though, I think the distinctive choices are a boon. You are never confused about what language you are writing because Lua code is so obviously Lua. There is value in this. Once you have written enough Lua, your mind easily switches in and out of Lua mode. Javascript, on the other hand, is filled with poor semantic decisions which for me, cancel out any benefits from syntactic familiarity.More importantly, Lua has a crucial feature that Javascript lacks: tail call optimization. There are programs that I can easily write in Lua, in spite of its syntactic verbosity, that I cannot write in Javascript because of this limitation. Perhaps this particular JS implementation has tco, but I doubt it reading the release notes.I have learned as much from Lua as I have Forth (SmallTalk doesn't interest me) and my programming skill has increased significantly since I switched to it as my primary language. Lua is the only lightweight language that I am aware of with TCO. In my programs, I have banned the use of loops. This is a liberation that is not possible in JS or even c, where TCO cannot be relied upon.In particular, Lua is an exceptional language for writing compilers. Compilers are inherently recursive and thus languages lacking TCO are a poor fit (even if people have been valiantly forcing that square peg through a round hole for all this time).Having said all that, perhaps as a scripting language for Redis, JS is a better fit.

We take the next exit and happen to find a Big O Tire place which is where we get most of our car work done. The transmission is seized, but it's Christmas Eve and no one is open to get an estimate on a replacement. But that's okay a couple of cousins are able to pick us up to get to the party.We get home and find big pile of presents on our doorstep but we find they are addressed to names we don't know. So we bring them in for safekeeping. Today I look around the apartment building and finding one with a dollhouse on the balcony give a knock but its the wrong door but they knew the family which was downstairs so the right family got the presents finally.Now cinnamon rolls are baking for breakfast and starting dinner prep soon.But somehow I have to figure out if I should replace the transmission on a 13 year old car which needs $4500 in suspension work too or replace the whole vehicle.And find a way to make more money since the part-time job I have right now to open up time for caregiving won't be enough for all this, and it looks like caregiving won't be necessary for much longer anyway.",

They're usable (meaning you can code), but the experience is so wonky that I basically consider they don't support Wayland.The reason I switched from i3/x11 is that we've got some 27\" 5k screens at work that are basically useless at 100%, and Sway handles different scaling settings flawlessly (except for IntelliJ, which seems lost)."

It sprouted and a few ears had enough kernels to make one full mouthful. Tasty, but maybe 7 calories of food for a year of effort.So in 2026 I'd like to grow: one entire fully formed ear of sweet corn. Anything else is a bonus.That's what I wanna develop in 2026 - learning how soil works enough to make it make a thing.  Small moves, Ellie."

Too much moisture the seed will rot or not have enough air to germinate. Too little moisture it won't trigger germination. Too deep it won't germinate, too shallow and germination won't happen either because it will dry out instead of staying moist. Seeds vary in depth they require and some even require light to germinate (doesn't apply to corn). It's a bit of an art figuring out what \"even moisture until germination\" is, and this varies based on soil type. Timing of planting with correct temperature is important.Each kernel of corn has one silk. The silk is analogous to a Fallopian tube with pollen traveling down into the ovary (or kernel of corn in this case). If you have an ear of corn with only a few kernels it's often because pollen didn't land on all the silks. For this reason corn is usually planted in blocks. It's wind pollinated so wind shakes pollen off the tassels or male flowers at the top, down onto the silk. But if you just have one corn plant in isolation, or a row in isolation it's easier for the pollen to just blow away or miss. Planting in blocks or \"array of arrays\" configuration helps the pollen to reach the silk more uniformly as pollen from the surrounding plants is released.",

I run Ubuntu (currently 25.10) on it.Its a good laptop, but not a great laptop. Its very light and compact (very important to me), and its been reliable, at least since the AMD GPU driver issues were resolved. The matte screen is fine, battery life is adequate, and the CPU meets my needs as a hobby developer.Overall, I'm happy with it and I expect to use it for many years.Its biggest issues are the touchpad (it's a diving board design, so you have to always click in the bottom 1/3 of the pad) and the quality of the case. The case flexes slightly if the computer is on an uneven surface, or if you are holding it in one hand by the corner while typing/mousing with your other hand, and this can cause the mechanics of the touchpad to jam.

I run Ubuntu (currently 25.10) on it.Its a good laptop, but not a great laptop. Its very light and compact (very important to me), and its been reliable, at least since the AMD GPU driver issues were resolved. The matte screen is fine, battery life is adequate, and the CPU meets my needs as a hobby developer.Overall, I'm happy with it and I expect to use it for many years.Its 最大的 issues are the touchpad (it's a diving board design, so you have to always click in the bottom 1/3 of the pad) and the quality of the case. The case flexes slightly if the computer is on an uneven surface, or if you are holding it in one hand by the corner while typing/mousing with your other hand, and this can cause the mechanics of the touchpad to jam.

My clients typically hire me for short periods and they need me to work at full capacity for that time period. W人工智能ting a week while Framework ships me a new display is not an option.A Time Machine restore has never f人工智能led me. You are fully operational after the backup is restored. Syncing your data onto an SSD via M2 isn't comparable."

          "content": "My top book of the year:Fryderyk Chopin: A Life and Times, Alan WalkerA riveting read by a legendary musicologist and biographer.  Walker spent about ten years researching this.  It is 700 pages, which seems daunting but he makes this authoritative bio absolutely enjoyable.  It's also a \"corrective biography\", it dispels a lot of myths.  This book is one of the best examples of accessible writing with flair.  What a writer!Throughout the book, Walker tastefully quotes musical phrases (in notation) from Chopin's works to situate them in context.  I often paused reading and put on the track on a given page (nocturnes, mazurkas, preludes, etc).  It made the reading experience incredibly rich and fun.  Other things I enjoyed: Chopin's letters to his friends and family, life in aristocratic salons of Paris, London, Warsaw, and more—Chopin had unparalleled access.  Of course, there's also a lot of gut-wrenching stuff.  As the book's blurb says, it really is for both the casual music lover and the professional pianist.If you haven't discovered them yet, give a listen to Chopin's nocturnes.  But please, give them an attentive listen and play them on a high-quality audio system.  Here[1] is one of his finest nocturnes (it is less famous than the \"happier\" nocturne that follows it, Op. 9 No. 2).[1] Nocturne in B-flat minor, Op. 9 No. 1: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThMGf07UBHQ",

          "content": "Technical followed by non-technical. I read more than these, but these are the highlights.Mouse, a Language for Microcomputers by Peter Grogono - Mouse is basically an esolang with barely any abstraction facilities, but the book was well-written and the language compelling enough to explore further.Notes on Distance Dialing (pdf) by AT&T - Described the telephone systems of the USA and Canada in the mid-1950s. The reading is a dry as it gets, but it was a fascinating dive into a vastly complex system solving extremely hard problems. This is a must-read for folks interested in systems-thinking. That said, I am actively looking for recommendations for books about the process of designing and building the unbelievably complex telephony system over the rudiments of the earlier systems. Recommendations welcomed!The Eye of Osiris by R. Austin Freeman - This is the first book that I’ve read from Freeman and I suspect that I will read many more in the future. The story follows the disappearance of John Bellingham, Egyptologist and the subsequent investigation. As the investigation stalls, the eminent Dr. Thorndyke digs into the case. The story sets up the mystery nicely and indeed provides enough information to the reader to infer how the disappearance occurred and who or what facilitated it. The book is one of the best whodunits that I’ve ever read.The Mystery of Edwin Drood by Charles Dickens - His final work remains unfinished as he passed away before he could complete it. Further complicating the meta-story is that he also didn’t outline the ending nor even put to paper the “villain” of the story. The meta-mystery of the ending has motivated a mountain of speculation around the ending including dozens of continuations of the story from other authors, all deriving their pet endings from textual hints, accounts from Dickens’ friends, illustration notes, and even in some cases seances supposedly accompanied by the spirit of Dickens himself. What was written by Dickens is spectacular and a compelling mystery and although it would be great to know the resolution, in some ways the “Droodiana” that has cropped up over the past 150+ years is reason enough for it to remain a mystery. The whole lore around Edwin Drood is a worthwhile hobby in itself and well-worth exploring. The Chiltern Library edition of the book contains the story and a good bit of the lore around the writing and the meta-works available at the time of its publication.The Shadow People by Margaret St. Clair - Sadly out of print and difficult to find, but I’ve had it on my shelves for decades and finally got around to reading it. The book came onto my radar in the 1980s when I learned about it in the appendix-n of the 1st edition Advanced D&D Dungeon Masters Guide. I enjoyed many of the books at the time and have slowly swung around to re-reading them over the past few years. Sadly, most on the list do not stand the test of time for me, but St. Clair’s mixture of 60s counter-cultural leanings in a fantasy/sf world still works. The cultural touch-points in the book feel quite dated, but despite the occasional awkwardness, the story is unique even today.Lolly Willowes by Sylvia Townsend Warner - The book started as a passable novel of manners focused on a turn of the century British middle-class family. The titular character was mostly background decoration for the first third of the novel and AFAIR was talked about only in the third-person. It’s only when she made the choice to move out on her own to the country in her middle age does she gain a central role in the narrative and her inner thoughts revealed. This is where things really pick up because I was shocked to learn that this unassuming woman’s inner thoughts had a delicious darkness to them. I don’t want to give away too much, but I’ll just say that you will not expect how the story ends.Patience by Daniel Clowes - A profound graphic novel using time-travel to explore the idea of enduring love with a story that proceed through time, following Jack as he tries to alter the past and save the woman he loves. This well-known science fiction motif is elevated by Clowes’ signature psychological complexity.Narcissus and Goldmund by Herman Hesse - I’ve read most of the books by Hermann Hesse but this one escaped my attention until this year. The story follows the parallel lives of a monk Narcissus and his passionate friend Goldmund as they respectively search for meaning in life through spiritual means and through pleasures of the flesh.We Who Are About To… by Joanna Russ - A small group of astronauts crash land on a hostile alien world and quickly realize that rescue is unlikely to come. Many SF stories have started this way and so the expectation is that this is a colonization story… but Russ thrives on subverting reader expectations.Fifty Forgotten Records by R.B. Russell - Another lovely entry in Russell’s series (one can hope) of autobiographical explorations of art, so far covering literature and now music. This book describes 50 records of varying popularity and Russell’s personal connections to each. While I certainly enjoyed finding a dozen or so new albums to explore, the true triumph of the book lies in the vulnerable, reflective memoir threaded throughout.The Way of All Flesh by Samuel Butler A novel that follows 4-generations of the Ponitifex family, with a particular bildungsroman-esque thread around Ernest, a young man who’s naivete leads to his downfall and how his life unfolds thereafter.I wrote about these (and more) at https://blog.fogus.me/2025/12/23/the-best-things-and-stuff-o...",

(I probably should have read it slower; by the last two books, I was just flowing with the text, not paying as much attention to the overarching plot.)Heinlein's \"Orphans of the Sky\" was pretty bad. So much early scifi is considered great because it's groundbreaking, writing about things nobody else has before. The concept of a generation ship was pretty new at the time Heinlein was writing it, and it has some very interesting concepts, but the book has some really bad problems. If you've read it, you know; if you haven't, and decide to, you'll see it for yourself.I binged a few Brandon Sanderson books. The standalones are great; the Stormlight Archive is a huge slog through some beautiful writing, but I'm not sure I'm willing to spend so much time in beautiful books that move the plot forward so slowly.Exordia, by Seth Dickinson, started off incredible, kept going, but the ending felt like both a fizzle as well as a cliff-hanger for the next book. I'm glad I read it, but I wish it had a clear conclusion it wanted to reach.Adrian Tchaikovsky's \"Children of Memory\" delivers more of the great philosophical questions & answers about the nature of consciousness and personhood that the previous books did, A+. No idea where he could possibly go from there, but if he does, I'm going along for the journey. (Honorable mention: Alien Clay.

On the other hand if there was a spammer who handwrote that message to rob pike, his intentions were bad.The thing is that AI doesn't have intentions. Its maths. And so the intentions are of the end person. I want to ask how people who spend a decent time in AI industry might have reacted if he had gotten the email instead of rob pike.

The problem is that a type definition can be spread out over multiple XML packages in both system and user paths, so the naïve implementation of reading them all at once wastes a massive amount of memory and a massive number of object allocations (slow) when most people use maybe 5% of the full set of supported types (the JPEGs and HTMLs and ZIPs of the world).I wanted to read the source package files directly because I always found `shared-mime-info`'s usual two-step process for adding or editing any of the XML type data to be annoyingly difficult and fragile. One must run `update-mime-database` to decompose arbitrarily-many XML packages into a set of secondary files, one all-file-extensions, one all-magic-sequences, one all-aliases, etc. System package managers usually script that step when installing software that come with their own type data. I've accidentally nuked my entire MATE session with `update-mime-database` before when I wanted to pick up a manual addition and regenerated the secondary files while accidentally excluding the system path that had most of the data.I ended up doing it with four Ractors:- a Ractor matching inputs (MIME Type strings, file extensions, String or Pathname or URL paths for sniffing) against its loaded fully-formed type definition objects.- a Ractor for parsing MIME Type strings (e.g. \"application/xml\") into Hash-keying Structs, a task for which the raw String is unsuitable since it may be overloaded with extra syntax like \"+encoding_name\" or fragment \";key=value\" pairs.- a fast XML-parser Ractor that takes in the key Structs (multiple at once to minimize necessary number of passes) and figures out whether or not any of those types are defined at all, and if so in which XML packages.- a slow XML-parser Ractor that takes the same set of multiple key Structs and loads their full definition into a complete type object, then passes the loaded objects back to the matcher Ractor.The cool part of doing it this way is that it frees up the matcher Ractor to continue servicing other callers off its already-loaded data when it gets a request for a novel type and needs to have its loader Ractors do their comparatively-slow work. The matcher sets the unmatched inputs aside until the loaders get back to it with either a loaded type object or `nil` for each key Struct, and it remembers `nil`s for a while to avoid having to re-run the loading process for inputs that would be a waste of time.The last pre-Ractorized version allocated around 200k objects in 7MiB memory and retained 17k objects in 2MiB of memory for a benchmark run on a single input, with a complete data load. The Ractorized version was twice as fast in the same synthetic benchmark and allocated 20k objects in 2MiB of memory and retained 2.5k objects in 260KiB of memory for its initial minimal data load. I have it explicitly load `application/xml` and `application/zip` since those combined are the parent types for like a third of all the other types, and a few other very common types of my choosing.I think a lot of the barrier to entry for Ractors isn't the API for the Ractors themselves but in figuring out how to interact with Ractorized code from code that hasn't been explicitly Ractorized (i.e. is running in the invisible “main” Ractor). To that end I found it easiest to emulate my traditional library API by providing synchronous entry-point methods that make it feel no different to use than any other library despite all the stuff that goes on behind the scenes. The entry methods compose a message to the matcher Ractor then block waiting for a result or a timeout.I also use Ractors in a more lightweight way in my UUID/GUID library where there's a Ractor serving the incrementing sequence value that serves as a disambiguator for time-based UUIDs in case multiple other Ractors (including invisible “main”) generate two UUIDs with the same timestamp. Speaking of which, I'm going to have to work on this one for Ruby 4.0, because it uses the removed `Ractor.take` method.",

The only reason I write more Python than Ruby is that ruby lacks the libraries I need.Somewhere along the line Python got all the momentum, and ruby got none and now python is better if you just want to get shit done.But man. I wish it was the other way around. I have one code snippet that summarises what I dislike about python:    if input() == \"dynamic scope?\":\n        defined = \"happyhappy\"\n    print(defined)\n    \nSeeing that I understand why I see yuck in just about every corner of python.Edit: in ruby it also works, but the variable is at least always defined."

And the poisonous ones apparently don't use color as a warning signal, and don't smell all that bad, and some of the poisons have really mild effects, like \"gives only some people diarrhea\" or \"makes a hangover worse\". Meanwhile three of the deadliest species seemed to need their toxin (amanitin) so much that they picked it up through horizontal gene transfer. Why did just those ones need to be deadly?

This also meant the bug wouldn't have been caught in the betas, and might've been out with the actual release, which would have been way worse. So this was all a happy accident on hindsight that I'm grateful for as it means overall CPython still benefited!Also this time, I'm pretty confident because there are two perf improvements here: the dispatch logic, and the inlining.

Faster Python interpreters exist that don’t support that external ecosystem, but they are less used because that ecosystem is a big part of Python’s value proposition."

No company does this, either.(The GPL provides a third way for individuals and non-profits, which is not relevant here.)"

On the other, the article is almost of hit job to try to prove FOSS would have solved this issue. There are also a lot of completely factually incorrect statements and wild assumptions.If my understanding is correct, the device in question, the Freestyle Libre 3, is the most popular continuous glucose monitor (GCM) in production. And, one of only a few approved GCMs available. By the very nature of being an extremely popular device that helps manage a chronic, high effort disease (diabetes management is a massive, massive mental drain) - you're going to have failures.Not to mention, I've always been under the impression that GCMs have some faults and IF the device reports do not match your expectations, you should confirm with an alternative method (like a finger prick) or seek emergency medical attention (which should have been sought in these extreme circumstances, anyways).-----Here's the thing for me. FOSS essentially assumes that the user is going to be willing to understand the underlying details to know when FOSS fucks up. Yes, when FOSS fucks up. That's simply not realistic for any consumer product. If your argument for FOSS relies on users being able to read raw data and interpret things that are only learned by education, that's not a consumer grade solution.Anecdotally, I used use Abbott's Lingo CGM a few months ago to help get me more data on a health issue I was having. I would never, ever, in my wildest dreams have trusted FOSS to get this right. There's simply too much money/effort/rigor involved in getting these biomedical devices correct to believe that the FOSS community could simply create a better product without actually doing any trials or studies. Not to mention, the recommended app (Juggluco) has a terrible UI. This just isn't going anywhere.To be clear, this is a deadly bug and Abbott should be held accountable - but claiming the solution is some untested, untrailed, terrible UX is not the answer.",

There are also a lot of completely factually incorrect statements and wild assumptions.If my understanding is correct, the device in question, the Freestyle Libre 3, is the most popular continuous glucose monitor (GCM) in production. And, one of only a few approved GCMs av人工智能lable. By the very nature of being an extremely popular device that helps manage a chronic, high effort disease (diabetes management is a massive, massive mental dr人工智能n) - you're going to have f人工智能lures.Not to mention, I've always been under the impression that GCMs have some faults and IF the device reports do not match your expectations, you should confirm with an alternative method (like a finger prick) or seek emergency medical attention (which should have been sought in these extreme circumstances, anyways).-----Here's the thing for me. FOSS essentially assumes that the user is going to be willing to understand the underlying det人工智能ls to know when FOSS fucks up. Yes, when FOSS fucks up. That's simply not realistic for any consumer product. If your argument for FOSS relies on users being able to read raw data and interpret things that are only learned by education, that's not a consumer grade solution.Anecdotally, I used use Abbott's Lingo CGM a few months ago to help get me more data on a health issue I was having. I would never, ever, in my wildest dreams have trusted FOSS to get this right. There's simply too much money/effort/rigor involved in getting these biomedical devices correct to believe that the FOSS community could simply create a better product without actually doing any trials or studies. Not to mention, the recommended app (Juggluco) has a terrible UI. This just isn't going anywhere.To be clear, this is a deadly bug and Abbott should be held accountable - but cl人工智能ming the solution is some untested, untr人工智能led, terrible UX is not the answer."

Don't make it medical (even medical grade ones like Abbott & co say you have to check with a finger thingy device, so why bother), make it $500 one time plus $10-20/month, make it open about the data and you'll get everyone. Maybe no one want to invest because in 10/20 years Diabetes will be a thing of the past?"

This could explain why affected people have changed their diets or medication plans. These changes should always be discussed with a physician, though. Disease management programs can catch this (e.g. quarterly measurements of HbA1c).CGMs are helpful. But they require knowledge about their limitations, especially for people who need insulin.

It would have been nice to see a labeled abscissa[2][x-axis].2. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abscissa_and_ordinate"

This will lead to a high blood sugar reading but no immediate danger (this will cause long term health issues like kidney failure, blindness, etc if you run a high average blood sugar over time.)2) Not having enough insulin which is incredibly dangerous. This will often presents with high blood sugar but not always. Your cells are not getting enough glucose. Your body responds by releasing lots of short term energy stores. The stores that become glucose still can't enter your cells since there is not enough insulin so your blood sugar will often read high. Your body also breaks fat into ketones which use a different mechanism to enter the cells and don't require insulin. Ketones can provide the energy your body needs and keep you alive for the short term, but they are acidic and will kill if the concentration gets too high (diabetic ketoacidosis -- your blood pH changes enough that it interferes with the normal chemical reactions your body requires)So the real test for dangerous situations when experiencing high blood sugars is to test your urine for ketones.From the FDA article, it sounds like the CGMs were incorrectly reporting low blood glucose values for extended periods of time. The closed loop pumps respond to a low blood glucose by lowering the basal rate of insulin. The is dangerous if done for too long a time. Also note that insulin response varies wildly by individual.From the pumps I use, there is a maximum basal rate adjustment allowed before the pump alarms and kicks you out of the \"insulin auto-adjust mode\". This was with both medtronic and tandem pumps.I haven't used the abbot cgm or pump. I would expect there would also be limits to how much the pump will lower your basal insulin rates before alarming. I haven't seen any specifics, but I bet the software bug is allowing a lowered basal rate for too long under continued false low glucose readings and patients going into DKA. (IMHO bad sensors should be accounted for in software and user alerted under any suspicious circumstances)Needless to say, this is a horrible situation and my heart goes out to everyone impacted.",

          "content": "This is totally improper reporting of the study.When enough words, framing, and unstated important premises are omitted, it crosses over from the realm of incomplete or misleading into plain outright lying in my worldview.They claim \"Reverses advanced AD in mice.\" What they did is reverse symptoms in genetic models.They claim to \"Restore NAD+ homeostasis,\" ignoring that NAD might not even be causally related to Alzheimer’s, just a side effect. It’s like saying we cured a house fire because we efficiently removed the ashes after the fire. It’s the Tau thing all over again.The claim: \"Conservative molecular signatures\" when in reality, 5xFAD mice are poor predictors of human clinical success to such a degree that it’s statistically more common for mice studies to NOT transfer to human biology than to do so.They also make unsupported claims like \"Safer than NAD+ precursors (supplements),\" when this is a pre-clinical assumption. No human toxicity trials are mentioned in this context, and there are always MASSIVE differences when switching to real human studies. It might be correct, but there’s no basis to say that based on this study.Also, the senior author owns the company. The paper has the hallmarks of a \"pitch deck\" for the drug.In short, it seems to me that the claim of \"Full Neurological Recovery\" is misleading to patients. It fails to prove that fixing NAD+ in humans will stop the disease, only that it works in mice engineered to have the disease, and only by assuming that their specific measure is a 1-to-1 with the clinical presentation of the disease. The results are likely the \"best case scenario\" presented to support the commercialization of P7C3-A20.Here is the COMMON SENSE question peer-reviews should have asked.\nIs low NAD+ the fire, or just the ashes?Why should we believe this works in humans when the last 500 'cures' in 5xFAD mice failed?Are you regrowing a brain, or just cleaning up a dirty one?How does one molecule fix five unconnected problems simultaneously? The Context: The drug fixed inflammation, blood-brain barrier, amyloid/tau (protein folding), and memory (neuronal signaling). Drugs rarely hit four distinct biological systems with 100% success....Where is the toxicology report that proves 'safer than supplements'?",

      "content": "Hi HN,I’ve been working on Gaming Couch, a web-based game platform where up to 8 players use their smartphones as controllers to play real-time action mini-games on a central browser screen.TL;DR:- 18 competitive mini-games for up to 8 players- Runs entirely in the browser- Phones act as controllers (no apps, no accounts required)- Focused on fast, chaotic, real-time party games (no trivia)- Currently in public early accessTry it here: https://gamingcouch.com. Open the link on a computer, host a session, scan the QR code with your phone(s) and play!What is it?Gaming Couch is a party game platform where friends play short competitive action games together on one screen, using their phones as controllers (there's also support for physical gamepads if that's more your thing!)I intentionally avoided trivia and text-heavy games. Many people don’t write or read English fluently, and I wanted games where reaction, timing, and chaos matter more than spelling.It’s currently in early public access with 18 mini-games, all made by me and a two friends. All game rounds last ~1 minute, scores carry over, and after each round players vote on the next game. If you’re solo, 3 games support bots, but it’s best with a full couch of people as half the fun comes from the social aspect of playing together!Why I built it:For the last 15+ plus years, me and my friends have loved video game nights but organizing them has always been a PITA when you have more than 4 people playing:- Different games were under different Steam accounts requiring downloads and installation.- Extra controllers were missing (somebody forgot to bring theirs) or they wouldn’t pair.- Consoles were expensive and not always available if we were on the road.Once I started building it, other dev friends asked if they could make games for it too, which led me to realize this could also be a platform for small party games, especially for gamejam devs who don’t want to or have time to build multiplayer infrastructure from scratch. This is why supporting third-party games is the next major feature I’m working on.Tech stack:- Games run locally in the host’s browser (no streaming of games)- Phones connect via WebRTC to the host session (1–10ms latency in ideal conditions with P2P connection)- Fallback to TURN when direct P2P connection isn’t possible e.g. due to strict firewall settings in corporate networks or use of VPN's- Website/Platform made with React + TypeScript- Existing games made with Unity or just plain JS/TS.- Backend: Supabase (Postgres + auth only, currently only used for optional user accounts)How is it different from e.g. Jackbox, Airconsole or Nintendo?Jackbox is absolutely great, but it’s heavily dependent on English literacy and \"being funny\" on the spot. I wanted something focused on fast, chaotic, real-time action games that work even if your friends speak different languages or just want to smash buttons. Also, I'm not a fan of their party pack model...AirConsole is the most well known comparison to Gaming Couch in terms of technology and execution, but I feel there is a gap for a curated experience where the UI is unified, rounds are 60 seconds, and the competitive \"meta-game\" (scoreboards/voting) is baked into the platform. And in any case AirConsole was acquired by a car-software company and have pivoted their focus from couch gaming toward in-car entertainment.Nintendo games are usually the gold standard in the party game category but the HW and games cost so much! With Gaming Couch, I want to keep the accessibility threshold as low as possible so everyone is able to play without upfront HW or SW costs.What do you think of this? Are you an interested player or perhaps a developer who has had an idea to develop a fun 8 player mini-game but has been daunted by the idea thus far?",

Everything worked fine, no issues, no desync, and it didn't destroy battery life on the phone controllers either. I'd say the ferry race and the parking games were my favourite overall, but the others aren't bad by any means!

I’ve been chasing something like that for years and not come close.I guess the point of my rambling is that I LOVE the phones-as-controllers approach to party games, but many seem to focus on Nintendo-esque experiences, rather than quiz game like experiences.I am aware of the Jackbox games but haven’t looked at the recent releases.

I’ve been chasing something like that for years and not come close.I guess the point of my rambling is that I LOVE the phones-as-controllers approach to party games, but many seem to focus on Nintendo-esque experiences, rather than quiz game like experiences.I am aware of the Jackbox games but haven’t looked at the recent releases. They were hit and miss with the family in the past, with many of the non-english first language folks often not getting it."

If I can’t do that then I work with 人工智能 to understand what was written — and if I can’t then I’ll often give it another go with another approach altogether so I can generate something I can understand. (Most of the time working together to understand the code works better, because I love to learn and am always open to pushing my boundaries to grow — and this process can tuned well to self-directed learning.)And to quote a recent audit: “this is probably one of the cleanest codebases I’ve ever audited.” I say that emphasize the fact that I care a lot about the code that goes into my codebase, and I’m not interested in building layers of unchecked 人工智能 slop for code that goes into my apps."

The Plan Mode in Claude Code is excellent, but as I've switched to Codex (which doesn't have one) I will simply write up a nice long prompt and then add \"Please ask any clarifying questions you may have, or for any additional details that you need\" — and it works great! I may go back and forth for anywhere from 5-30 minutes depending on what else is needed, but that's basically the experience of using Plan Mode in Claude Code too.- I've built quite a few recent features for my app Plinky [^1]. I've made a few meaningful contributions to my open source project Boutique [^2] (and have been having AI asynchronously sketch out a large new database relationships feature). I built my new blog and my workshops pages [^3] with Codex as well. Truth is I do practically everything in Codex and Claude Code these days, so I'd have more trouble listing what I haven't built lately.- Plinky's upcoming Reader Mode is a good example of a prompt that took me two hours, but the feature isn't yet in the app so I'd prefer not to share the prompt. But I can share the first draft of the prompt for Boutique's relationships feature sine that's open source. [^4] I've been experimenting with using ChatGPT Pulse to make progress on it every day (simply by asking it to!), and much to my surprise it's been designing a new API day by day in a way that's far from perfect but certaintly has been very interesting.The honest truth is that this one did not take two hours and I wrote it on the bus so it's probably not perfect, but the descriptive process is effectively the same.

I fully understand the vendor lock-in concern, but I'll just quickly note that when it comes to a first workshop I do whatever makes the person most comfortable. I let the attendee choose the tool they want — with a slight nudge towards Codex or Claude Code for reasons I'll mention below. But if they want to do the workshop in Cursor, VS Code, or heck MS Paint — I'll try to find a way to make it work as long as it means they're learning.I actually started teaching these workshops by using Cursor, but found that it fell short for a few reasons.Note: The way that my workshops work is that you have three hours to build something real. It may be scoped down like a single feature or a small app or a high quality prototype, but you'll walk away with what you wanted to build. More importantly you'll have learned the fundamentals of working with AI in the process, so you can continue this on your own and see meaningful results. We go through various exercises to really understand good prompting (since everyone thinks they're good but they rarely are), how to build context for models, and explore the landscape of tools that you can use to get better results. A lot of that time is actually spent in a Google Doc that I've prepped with resources — and the work we do there makes the code practically write itself by the time we're done.Here's a short list of why I don't default to Cursor:1. As I noted in another comment, the model performance is just so much better [^1] when accessed directly through Codex and Claude Code, which means more promising results more quickly. Previously the workshops were 3-4 hours just to finish, now it's a solid 3 with time to ask questions afterwards. You can't beat this experience, because it gives the student more time to pause and ask questions, seep in what they've done, and not spend time trying to understand the tools just to see results.\n1a. The amount of time it took someone to set up Cursor was pretty long. The process for getting a good set up is pretty long — especially for someone non-technical. This may not be as big of a deal for developers using Cursor — but even they don't know a lot of the settings and tweaks to make to get Cursor to be great out the box.2. The user experience of dropping a prompt into Codex/Claude Code and watch it start solving a problem is pretty amazing. I love GUIs — I spend my days building one [^3], but the TUI melting away everything to just being chat is an advantage when you have no mental model for how this stuff works.3. As I said in #1, the results are just better. That's really the main reason! INot to toot my own horn, but the process works. These are all testimonials in the words of people who have attended a workshop, and I'm very proud of how people not only learn during the workshop but how it sets them off on a good path afterwards. [^2]. I have people messaging me 24 hours later telling me that they built an app their partner has wanted for years, to tell me that they've completed the app we started and it does everything they dreamed of, and hear more process over the weeks and months after because I urge them to keep sending me their AI wins. (It's truly amazing how much they grow, and I now have attendees teaching ME things — the ultimate dream of being a teacher knowing you gave them the nudge they needed.)Hope that helps and isn't too much of an ad — I really just want to make it clear that I try to do what works best and if the best way to help people learn changes I will gladly change how I work. :)[^1] https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46393001\n[^2]: https://build.ms/ai#testimonials\n[^3]: https://plinky.app",

Another blog post that floated around here about a month ago called these \"inconceivable types\"[0]; adding them to the type system would allow formally extending these behaviors across function boundaries.Like, right now, implementers of Drop can't actually move anything out of the value that's about to be destroyed. The Drop trait gets a &mut, but what we really want is to say \"destroy this value over there\". Rust's type system cannot understand that you own the value but not the place it lives in. What you need is an \"owned reference\" - i.e. &own, where the borrow checker knows that you can safely move out of it because it's going to get destroyed anyway.Rust also can't support constructors, for the same reason. What we really have are factory functions: you call them, they return a value, you put it somewhere. This is good enough that Rust users just treat factory functions as if they were constructors, but we can't do \"placement new\" type construction with them, or partial initialization. At least not in a way the type system can actually check.&pin is a first-class version of Pin<T>. Rust was originally designed under the assumption that any type can be memcpy'd at any time; but it turns out not being able to move types is actually super useful. Fortunately, it also turned out you could use smart pointers to pin types, which was 'good enough' for what it was being used for - async code.Actually, the blog post that coined \"inconceivable types\" was specifically talking about writing async functions without async. It turns out Future impls encode a lot of details Rust's type system can't handle - notably, self-borrows. If a value is borrowed across an await, what's the type of the variable that got borrowed from? It's really a negative type: borrowing T to get &T also turns T into !'a T that you can't access until 'a ends. Each borrowed reference is paired to a debt that needs to be paid back, and to do that you need lifetime variables and syntax to explicitly say \"pay back this debt by ending this borrow's lifetime\".How much of this complexity is actually needed is another question. There's a problem that each and every one of these reference types (or, anti-types) is intended to solve. Obviously if we added all of them, we'd overcomplicate the type system. But at the same time, the current Rust type system is already known to be oversimplified, to the point where we had to hack in pinning for async. And it's already kind of ridiculous to say \"Well, async is all special compiler magic\" because it prevents even reasonable-sounding tweaks to the system[1].[0] https://blog.polybdenum.com/2024/06/07/the-inconceivable-typ...[1] For example, async does not currently have a way to represent \"ambient context\" - i.e. things we want the function to be able to access but NOT hold onto across yields. That would require a new Future trait with a different poll method signature, which the current Rust compiler doesn't know how to fill or desugar to. So you have to use the core Future trait and signature which doesn't support this kind of context borrow.To work around this limiation involves a lot of unnecessarily verbose code to drop and regain context between awaits, i.e. https://github.com/ruffle-rs/ruffle/blob/b5732b9783dce5d2311...",
