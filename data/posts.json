      "abstract": "该讨论围绕“Linux现已足够好用”这一核心话题展开，用户们分享了从Windows或macOS转向Linux桌面体验的不同观点。多数用户对Linux的稳定性、性能和简洁性表示认可，有人认为相比Windows的臃肿和隐私问题，Linux如Debian或Ubuntu带来了更流畅、安静的使用体验，甚至“基本开箱即用”。也有用户指出，游戏兼容性仍是明显短板，例如反作弊支持不足、光线追踪功能失效、HDR支持不完善，以及部分游戏容易崩溃等问题，反驳了“Steam on Linux完全可用”的说法。讨论中提到，一些用户认为Linux的进步并非巨大，而是Windows体验下滑衬托所致；同时，有开发者从战略自主角度主张政府应转向Linux。尽管在具体技术细节和适用场景上存在分歧，社区普遍认同Linux在桌面领域已取得长足进步，尤其适合追求稳定、轻量或特定定制需求的用户，但在游戏和专业应用生态方面仍有改进空间。",

Although his conclusion was generally positive, there were problems with nearly every game:- F1 2024 didn't load due to anti-cheat- Dragon's Dogma 2 and Resident Evil 4 had non-functional raytracing- Cyberpunk 2077 with raytracing on consistently crashes when reloading a save game- Dying Light 2 occasionally freezes for a whole minute- Starfield takes 25 minutes to compile shaders on first run, and framerates for Nvidia are halved compared to Windows- Black Myth: Wukong judders badly on Nvidia cards- Baldur's Gate 3 Linux build is a slideshow on Nvidia cards, and the Windows build fails for some AMD cardsIf you research these games in discussion forums, you can find some configuration tweaks which might fix the issues. ProtonDB's rating is not a perfect indicator (BM:W is rated \"platinum\").And while Steve says measurements from Linux and Windows are not directly comparable, I did so anyway and saw that Linux suffers a 10-30% drop in average FPS across the board when compared to Windows, depending on the game and video card.",

Common browsers like Chrome and Firefox has no real support for HDR video playback on nVidia Linux drivers. The \"HDR\" option appears on YouTube, but no HDR color can be displayed with an nVidia GPU.Also, video backgrounds in Google Meet on Chrome are broken with nVidia GPUs and Wayland. Ironically it works on Firefox. This has been broken for a few years and no fix is in sight.The \"HDR\" toggle you get on Plasma or Mutter is hiding a ton of problems behind the scenes.

I spent a couple of hours of troubleshooting and gave up.My work PC needs to have the Dropbox app (which has a linux installer), but it also needs the \"online-only\" functionality so that I can see and browse the entire (very large) dropbox directory without needing to have it all stored locally. This has been a feature that has been being requested on the linux version of the app for years, and dropbox appears unlikely to add it anytime soon.Both of these are pretty niche issues that I don't expect to affect the vast majority of users (and the dropbox one in particular shouldn't be an issue at all if my org didn't insist on using dropbox in a way that it is very much not intended to be used, and for which better solutions exist, but I have given up on that fight a long time ago), and like I said, I've had linux on my laptop for a couple of years so far without any issue, and I love it.I am curious how many \"edge cases\" like mine exist out there though. Maybe there exists some such edge case for a lot of people even while almost no one has the same edge case issue.",

The Dell XPS line in particular shows a lot of promise for becoming a strict upgrade or sidegrade to the M2 line within a few years, assuming the haptic touchpad works as well as claimed.

You turn up the heat, to describe it very generally. It means, n a sense, radicalizing the population, a classic solution to Russia's problem. That's what terrorists do: How do you cause the US to shoot itself in the foot: terrorize people into thinking they are unsafe and overreacting (even though 9/11 affected on small area of one city).One way they turn up the heat is to spread ethnic hatred, social distrust, embrace of violence, and abandonment of those things that prevent those maladies: universal human rights, democracy, rule of law, etc.You can see it in this thread: People rooting for warfare, abandonment of the rule of law, etc. - all by some minor, cost-effective actions, like cutting a cable.The expensive action and infinitely more consequential action - the invasion of Ukraine - remarkably doesn't create the same outrage. That outrage would trigger the obviously best solution: Guaranteeing unlimited material and political support for Ukraine until they win the war.That is, it's remarkable if you don't appreciate information dominance, especially with social media companies either abandoning all responsibility or openly aiding the radicalization.

They also have some older Tornadoes, Mirages, and F-16 and F/A-18. All those aircraft are fighters, not strategic bombers. Their impact is limited; their range is about 700km.The EU doesn't have a plan for how to fight without the US. Today's airstrikes should be carefully planned: planes, pilots, munitions, targets, engagement trajectories, and return trajectories. They will need time to figure out those plans. In their shoes, I would have started drafting those plans four years ago, but they still didn't.The EU will not attack nuclear siloes, for fear of nuclear retaliation. Even if they try, most of those siloes are much farther than 700 km from Russia's borders. Those siloes were built by the USSR, and the USSR knew better.The EU will use Storm Shadows/SCALPs/Tauruses. There aren't many of those in arsenals. Trying to use smart planning bombs with sub-100 km range will only make casualties 10-20 fold.The EU strikes may reach Baltic and Black Sea naval bases, some energy infrastructure (port Primorsk being the first), and some airfields. They will not get the North Sea and Pacific bases, airfields near Murmansk, Saratov, and Irkutsk, which are used now to attack Ukraine.Russia has integrated air defence, anв the shit is real, it is fight-proven, it works day and night for the last 3 years. Ask Ukrainians.EU strikes will not be very effective and will not last. I estimate it in 1500-2000 sorties, and about half of those will reach the targets. The EU will lose about 100 planes and 50 pilots. Russia will receive a blow, but will not be devastated.Russia will retaliate with new conventional MRBM strikes on the military and double-use airfields, and also factories of Gripen, Rafale, Airbus, etc. With those strikes, the EU will lose another 200 planes and most of its capacity to produce and repair them. Russia will also strike one large natural gas storage, one LPG from the Gulf comes into. Russian diversants will deliver several hits to the EU energy system, probably to large distribution hubs.The EU stocks will drop to 70%-50% of their current value. The euro will fall by 20%-30% against global currencies. Electricity, gas, and heat prices will rise 2-3 times; gasoline and diesel prices will increase 1.5-2 times.Your move.",

Usually, your ISP gives you a /48 prefix, so you have 16 bits for potentially 64k internal networks. This way, you don't need something like DHCP to get an address, you just take it and you won't have conflicts.But because you have two independent unique parts, you need twice as many bits, so 64+64=128 bits.

Lots of good ideas were incorporated, but it resulted in a stack that had only complicated backwards compatibility.

The ban on selling lithography AND chips to China is massively backfiring. The chip ban in particular has created a captive market for Chinese chips. In 1945, American exceptionalists believed the USSR would take 20+ yars to copy the atomic bomb, if they could do it at all. It took 4 years. China will do the same thing with EUV in the coming years.Tesla is a trillion dollar company that was created entirely by government subsidies that only continues to exist because of the tariffs and import bans on BYD in the US and much of Europe.Additionally, Tesla is completely dependent on Chinese rare earth exports for its products.As an example of how China uses state power, a famine in the 20th century caused China to decide that food security was a national security interest. The availability of cheap, quality food is viewed as essential and the state intervenes to ensure that continues. Likewise for housing.Western companies seem increasingly focused on the top 10% because the bottom 90% have nothing left to eextract.",

BMW and others are pursuing the same strategy in the states. The car was never worth near that much to begin with. They were and are jacking up prices and pocketing the change.BYD is dumping.",

Over time, they grew comfortable, developed a massive upper class, and pivoted toward service and 'knowledge' jobs. They outsourced production to China or simply allowed China to take it over.Germany and the EU followed a similar path. We know how to build machines and industrial products; precision and detail are our stereotypes and trademark. However, we also grew comfortable, focusing on services and high-level strategy while we did not invest to fix energy prices, raw resource dependencies and labor/automatisation.How long is China looking fo resources in Afrika? Despite China being huge and having plenty of?China overtook Germany as the leader in industrial exports in 2018, and now in 2026, the gap is already to broad. China has mastered machine building, controls the entire supply chain, and possesses modern technology; all while maintaining lower labor costs and a massive workforce.Even if the USA and Germany try to avoid Chinese products, the rest of the world will not. We are entering a new era: the mass production of affordable, precise machinery globally, powered by China. If regions like Africa buy their solar, wind, and batteries from China, their entire energy grid and the machines running on it will be Chinese. They will look to China, not the West.For example, a German company making weaving machines recently noted their price must be €60k to stay profitable, while a Chinese machine of the same quality costs only €20k. Once technology reaches its peak, differentiation is no longer possible to justify higher prices. The car industry is next; cars are becoming a commodity with shrinking profit margins. This shift will make China incredibly wealthy over the next 20 years.And it wasn't even out of the blue. The shit was written on the wall and despite that what happens? We in germany discuss bureaucracy, if we should change our energy grid, IF investments in cheaper energy is reasonable etc.We can’t even build our own infrastructure anymore. Look at the SuedOstLink disaster: while China builds massive 'Super Grids' in record time, Germany has spent over a decade and billions of Euros just arguing about a single power cable. Because we are stuck in bureaucracy and 'Not In My Backyard' protests, our energy costs are skyrocketing, while China doesn't care but still beats us in renewables.It’s the perfect example of a society that has become so comfortable it has forgotten how to actually build the physical foundations of its own wealth.And adding on top of all of that: AI and Robotic progress is fast, so crazy fast than when its here, we might have solved the other issues i mentioned...",

The reason for that price point is because China is producing some of the cheapest batteries in the world.BYD cannot build their cars in the US because the core part they need to make them cheap is the batteries.  CATL makes the batteries that BYD uses and they aren't going to setup shop in the US.  A lot of what makes CATLs batteries cheap is because China has a raw materials trade pipeline that's now superior than what's available in the US.All of this goes back to tariffs.By putting insane tariffs on all imports the US has effectively isolated itself from the rest of the world.  Manufacturing will defacto be more expensive in the US because a significant portion of any incoming raw resources will get an automatic 25% tax.The US does have it's own raw resources, but they aren't fully developed.  Prior to 2024, we were heavily reliant on imports for a lot of our manufacturing.  Shaking up the entire market for stupid reasons has destroyed manufacturing in the US.

People are willing to pay $200 per month, and it is getting $1B dollar runway already.Being more of a Hardware person, the most interesting part to me is the funding of all the developments of latest hardware. I know this is another topic HN hate because of the DRAM and NAND pricing issue. But it is exciting to see this from a long term view where the pricing are short term pain. Right now the industry is asking, we have together over a trillion dollar to spend on Capex over the next few years and will even borrow more if it needs to be, when can you ship us 16A / 14A / 10A and 8A or 5A, LPDDR6, Higher Capacity DRAM at lower power usage, better packaging, higher speed PCIe or a jump to optical interconnect? Every single part of the hardware stack are being fused with money and demand. The last time we have this was Post-PC / Smartphone era which drove the hardware industry forward for 10 - 15 years. The current AI can at least push hardware for another 5 - 6 years while pulling forward tech that was initially 8 - 10 years away.I so wished I brought some Nvidia stock.

          "content": "The \"local models got good, but cloud models got even better\" section nails the current paradox. Simon's observation that coding agents need reliable tool calling that local models can't yet deliver is accurate - but it frames the problem purely as a capability gap.There's a philosophical angle being missed: do we actually want our coding agents making hundreds of tool calls through someone else's infrastructure? The more capable these systems become, the more intimate access they have to our codebases, credentials, and workflows. Every token of context we send to a frontier model is data we've permanently given up control of.I've been working on something addressing this directly - LocalGhost.ai (https://www.localghost.ai/manifesto) - hardware designed around the premise that \"sovereign AI\" isn't just about capability parity but about the principle that your AI should be yours. The manifesto articulates why I think this matters beyond the technical arguments.Simon mentions his next laptop will have 128GB RAM hoping 2026 models close the gap. I'm betting we'll need purpose-built local inference hardware that treats privacy as a first-class constraint, not an afterthought. The YOLO mode section and \"normalization of deviance\" concerns only strengthen this case - running agents in insecure ways becomes less terrifying when \"insecure\" means \"my local machine\" rather than \"the cloud plus whoever's listening.\"The capability gap will close. The trust gap won't unless we build for it.",

Kind of like the Morris worm running amok as an experiment gone wrong, I think we will sometime soon have someone set up an AI agent whose core loop is to try to propagate itself, either as an experiment or just for the lulz.The actual Agent payload would be very small, likely just a few hundred line harness plus system prompt. It's just a question of whether the agent will be skilled enough to find vulnerabilities to propagate. The interesting thing about an AI worm is that it can use different tricks on different hosts as it explores its own environment.If a pure agent worm isn't capable enough, I could see someone embedding it on top of a more traditional virus. The normal virus would propagate as usual, but it would also run an agent to explore the system for things to extract or attack, and to find easy additional targets on the same internal network.A main difference here is that the agents have to call out to a big SotA model somewhere. I imagine the first worm will simply use Opus or ChatGPT with an acquired key, and part of it will be trying to identify (or generate) new keys as it spreads.Ultimately, I think this worm will be shut down by the model vendor, but it will have to have made a big enough splash beforehand to catch their attention and create a team to identify and block keys making certain kinds of requests.I'd hope OpenAI, Anthropic, etc have a team and process in place already to identify suspicious keys, eg, those used from a huge variety of IPs, but I wouldn't be surprised if this were low on their list of priorities (until something like this hits).",

I don't think this is bottle necked on model quality.I don't need an AGI. I do need a secretary type agent that deals with all the simple but yet laborious non technical tasks that keep infringing on my quality engineering time. I'm CTO for a small startup and the amount of non technical bullshit that I need to deal with is enormous. Some examples of random crap I deal with: figuring out contracts, their meaning/implication to situations, and deciding on a course of action; Customer offers, price calculations, scraping invoices from emails and online SAAS accounts, formulating detailed replies to customer requests, HR legal work, corporate bureaucracy, financial planning, etc.A lot of this stuff can be AI assisted (and we get a lot of value out of ai tools for this) but context engineering is taking up a non trivial amount of my time. Also most tools are completely useless at modifying structured documents. Refactoring a big code base, no problem. Adding structured text to an existing structured document, hardest thing ever. The state of the art here is an ff-ing sidebar that will suggest you a markdown formatted text that you might copy/paste. Tool quality is very primitive.

But when you look at the lack of ethics from the industry, the cacophony of voices of non experts screaming \"this time it's really doom\", and the weariness/wariness that set in during the crypto cycle, it's a natural tendency that people are going to call snake oil.That said, I think the more accurate representation here is that HN as a whole is calling the hype snake oil. There's very little question anymore about the tools being capable of advanced things. But there is annoyance at proclamations of it being beyond what it really is at the moment which is that it's still at the stage of being an expertise+motivation multiplier for deterministic areas of work.

Having lived through the time when web pages were served through CGI and mobile phones only existed in movies, when SVMs where the new hotness in ML and people would write about how weird NNs were, I feel like I've seen a lot more concrete progress in the last few decades than this year.This year honestly feels quite stagnant. LLMs are literally technology that can only reproduce the past. They're cool, but they were way cooler 4 years ago. We've taken big ideas like \"agents\" and \"reinforcement learning\" and basically stripped them of all meaning in order to claim progress.I mean, do you remember Geoffrey Hinton's RBM talk at Google in 2010? [0] That was absolutely insane for anyone keeping up with that field. By the mid-twenty teens RBMs were already outdated. I remember when everyone was implementing flavors of RNNs and LSTMs. Karpathy's character 2015 RNN project was insane [1].This comment makes me wonder if part of the hype around LLMs is just that a lot of software people simply weren't paying attention to the absolutely mind-blowing progress we've seen in this field for the last 20 years. But even ignoring ML, the world's of web development and mobile application development have gone through incredible progress over the last decade and a half. I remember a time when JavaScript books would have a section warning that you should never use  JS for anything critical to the application.

      "abstract": "该讨论围绕“家长控制功能是否真正服务于父母”这一核心话题展开。用户普遍认为现有工具存在缺陷，难以有效保护儿童网络安全。有人认为家长控制过于复杂，如同企业级管理，耗费大量精力；也有用户指出这些工具本质上是“黑暗模式”，设计上并未真正考虑家长需求。讨论中提到，部分家长主张严格监控，认为互联网设备必须受成人监督，否则是家长失职；另一方则强调信任与沟通的重要性，认为教育孩子自主应对网络风险比单纯隔离更有效。共识在于，家长控制工具虽有必要但远远不够，需结合时间限制、持续教育和主动沟通。此外，有用户提及特定应用（如GroupMe）兼具学习用途，全面封锁可能影响正常使用。",

Guide them how to behave in strange, even weird and scary situations with strangers. Be the reliable adult in their life to whom they can tell when they encounter something unpleasant, online or offline. Under the guidance of a parent your children will be safer than behind any amount of protective layers that these so called child-safety apps provide, and they will also know how to help their friends to navigate risk and avoid danger.Or put another way, if your child must eventually swim in the sea, would rather that they know how to swim, or strap a fifth flotation device onto their back?",

Only so much can happen in, say, 2-3 30 minute sessions throughout the day, and the chances of a kid deciding to blow their precious minutes responding to some random person seems much lower than if bored and checking messages idly. Being nearby during a healthy sample of sessions to have a pulse on what's going on helps too - usually pretty obvious what they are doing.But I share the frustration of the author with how unreliable the controls are. Apple screen time controls routinely stop working - especially the one that only allows access to a finite list of websites. I need to check the browser history every week or so to confirm it is still working, and do some dance where I turn off controls, reboot, then turn back on every once in a while. The reason this particular control is important to me is that, even starting with something as pure as neil.fun, ads on that site have proven to be a few clicks away from semi-pornographic sites - it's terrible! And yet, turning off all internet access is such a coarse decision that limits access to things that are generally informational / fun / good (like neil.fun, or sports facts sites).",

Be aware of unintended consequences when you (try to) cut a child off from computer use.Having been involved with a reasonable number of problems, I’d say in the teen years negotiating and enforcing some kind of no-device sleep schedule is the most critical.If I had an answer to the rest of the addictive behavior, I wouldn’t be here making this post.",

The reason that managing this stuff is complicated is that you actually have to think about what restrictions you want (if any), understand the implications, and then set options to achieve those restrictions.

They would rather tell companies “parent my children correctly” and then sue as soon as the company’s vision of “safety” doesn’t line up with their own.In a country where you have parents with wildly different ideas about what constitutes “safety”, I have no idea why anyone thinks it is possible to set a single standard for this.",

I ended up finding a way via nefarious means. I bought a 25’ telephone cord from Radio Shack and when my parents weren’t home I would unplug their bedroom phone.  I discovered that if I ran the Prodigy installer it would connect to the Internet briefly to download the latest phone numbers in my area.  I found that I could alt-tab out of the full screen installer and use the lnternet unfiltered for about 10 minutes or so before they kicked me off.  This worked for about a year or so.I then had to resort to stealing my parent’s credit card and signing up for free trials and cancelling them before the charges incurred.  I eventually screwed up big time.  I downloaded a “free porn” BBS dialer and it made an international call to South America and ran up the phone bill $300 or so. I lost my computer privileges for a couple of months.  I guess the silver lining was when I turned 16, I immediately got a job and my drivers license so I could pay for my own phone line.

Loud, low-effort content often masquerades as significance, while quiet, honest, and carefully produced work is overlooked.

Plus a personal \"profile\" page [3]. Both blogs only have one post, the first one perhaps a couple of drafts I never got around polishing to publish them. The personal page I still have to update after quitting a PhD months ago.Why is this? Is it due to some lack of self discipline? Is it because, if I write why I quit a PhD, I would end up complaining about the current status of academia, and this could be at odds with my current employer's guidelines about posting on social media? Or is it because, if I stop and list all the things I have in the back of my mind that would require \"just half an hour a day\", I would end up filling a whole day?

There’d be high trust if it’s all locals providing services to locals. Host it on a cheap VPS so the library doesn’t even need infra; just a very small budget for the initiative.It’d be super decentralized. And the teams running these services would provide high quality feedback to the developers on features & operating of their services.Seems win-win.",

But \"audience\" is fundamentally one-directional. It turns participation into performance.I think a lot of internet nostalgia is really grief for a time when you could participate without being on stage. Sure, you wanted lots of people to read your blog, but we did have an era when posting didn't implicitly ask: how big is your following, how well did this travel, did it work.Today, the \"successful\" participants (the successful audience-builders) are called \"creators\", while everyone else (who is also creating, just without large-scale traction) is categorized as lesser or invisible. You can write a blog post, a tweet, a Reddit thread; you have undeniably created something. Yet without an audience, you haven't achieved the status that now defines digital legitimacy.What I miss is a participation model that didn't say: audience or perish.",

Mountains of innovations in media publishing, delivery, curation, navigation, supplementation via auto-generated captions and dubbing, all accreted over 20 years, enabling a density and breadth of open-ended human communication that is to me truly staggering.I'm not saying we should view centralized control over human comms infra as positive, or that we'll be \"stuck\" with it (I don't think we will be), just that we need to appreciate the nature and scale of the \"internet\" properly if we're to stand a chance of  seeing some way through to a future of decentralized information technology",

It’s the worldview of someone who wants to live in a small enchanted technical garden, treating the economic world as a gross external thing, that you can blame whenever you need a cause.And “unsecure code” in that context is part of the aesthetic: modernity is decadent, business is corrupting, therefore the code is “unsecure” and “meaningless.”The Brendan Eich stuff is the same genre: petty culture-war residue kept alive long after normal people moved on.So yeah, the internet continues, and until such artistic types learn to tamp down their own biases and refrain from injecting those into every word they write, I will keep away from their walled gardens.",

A title like “The Next Generation of Ham Radio” would have flopped.

You’d be shocked at the volume of this still being written by retirees on Blogger (no shade, it’s good to have a hobby, but goddamn there are a lot of you).The slice of “things an average person might plausibly care to look at” was vanishingly small.There are no spam filters, mods, or ways to report abuse when you run your content mill on your own domain.Like you, I was somewhat surprised by this result.

Its only if you go through the exercise of understanding why people use them, and what it would take to replicate them, that you can understand what it would actually take to improve them. For example, the fundamental feature of facebook is the network. And layered on, the ability to publish short-stories on the internet and have some control over who gets to read it. The technological part is hard but possible, and the network part well - think about how they did it originally. They physically targeted small social groups and systematically built it over time. It was a big deal when Facebook was open to my university, everyone got on about the same time, and so instantly you were all connecting with each other.I believe we can build something better. But I'm also now equally convinced that it's possible the next step isn't technological at all, but social. Regulation, breaking up the monopolies, whatever. We treat roads and all manner of other infrastructure as government provided; maybe a social platform is part of it. We always lean these thoughts dystopian, but also which of us technologically inclined readers and creators is spending as much time on policy documents, lobbying, etc, as we are schlepping code around hoping it will be a factor in this process. This is only a half thought but, at least these days I'm thinking more about not only is it time to build, but perhaps its time to be building non-code related things, to achieve what we previously thought were purely technological outcomes.",

It's obvious to us that is is disinterest, but they no way of truly knowing. And based on what they fear it can scare them, that unknowing.If you can convince the other person it truly it is simple disinterest, there is no problem.

See: https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38137661/- HPV16 is responsible for a large number of throat cancers (around 50% in smokers and 80% in non-smokers!). This affects both men and women.

Basically expanding from something like the current case, to vaccinating up to 45 year old will avert an extra 21k cases of cancer (compared to the base case of 1.4 million) - so about an extra 1.5% cases averted, while the direct vaccination costs are estimated to increase from 44 billion to 57 billion (+29%).The current guidance says \"do not recommend\" plus \"consult your doctor\". You should read that as \"blanket vaccination as public policy is cost inefficient in that age range\" not \"you as a 45 year old should not get the vaccine categorically\".",

          "content": "It was a misleading post.For the HPV section specifically, there were at least two major omissions.First, in his table showing autoimmune adverse effects, he has chosen to crop out the next column in the table containing the control conditions - which show very similar rates of adverse effects to the vaccine condition.Secondly, when discussing negative efficacy in the case of existing persistent infection, he only quotes the data from one of three studies that the linked report covers. The linked report indeed covers the negative efficacy in study 013 as an area of concern. However, study 015 (which had roughly twice the number of total participants as study 013) showed no real evidence of negative efficacy. When all 3 studies are pooled together, the point estimate still says negative efficacy, (at ~-12%), however the error bars are quite wide.Why this is tragic, is because these two omissions do actually point to failures in public communication about the vaccine. For example, the control condition in the Merck trials were a mix of saline injections (this is the traditional placebo), as well as injections with just the adjuvant (AAHS). This is less standard, and raises legitimate questions about why Merck used an adjuvant as the control, instead of just saline. There a cynical/conspiratorial angle to this question, which I think would be directionally correct.The second omission is because I think there is a reasonable question of \"are there extra risks associated with getting the HPV vaccine while having an active persistence infection\", even when taking into account the different and larger study populations within the original trial data. Once again, I think the idea that both companies and public health agencies don't want to deal with a vaccine that requires testing before hand is true. I also believe that on a population level, even if there was a modest increase in risk in that specific subgroup, it makes sense to implement broad vaccination campaigns.That said, I think the unwillingness of public health agencies to engage with this tricky area of communication and education creates these types of opening for anti-vaccine messaging. If you want a sense of \"conspiracy\" - here's a random review study - https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8706722/Notice that when reporting results, the groupings for HPV status at enrollment time are \"naive\" and \"irrespective\" - the \"test positive\" grouping isn't broken out.EDIT: The article that we're discussing is https://www.midwesterndoctor.com/p/the-perils-of-vaccinating...",

      "abstract": "该讨论围绕“美国半数黑胶唱片购买者没有唱机”的现象展开。社区普遍认同黑胶消费已超越实用功能，成为一种文化符号或支持艺术家的方式。有人认为购买黑胶是为了体验“主动聆听”的仪式感，如专注欣赏专辑艺术和完整播放；也有用户指出黑胶作为礼品或装饰品的趋势，甚至将其类比为购买T恤或海报。争议点集中在实际使用价值上：部分用户强调黑胶的音质缺陷和播放不便，批评其更多是“信号传递”而非消费行为；另一些则怀念黑胶带来的沉浸体验。讨论中提到，尽管数字媒体更便捷，但黑胶的实体属性和怀旧情感仍吸引着不同群体，包括年轻消费者。",

          "content": "I oversee pressing for over 150k+ records a year. We eliminated download cards a while ago because the redemption rate was so low. I wouldn’t doubt if the number of buyers who don’t own a record player is even higher tha 50%, and that the percentage of people who actually play the records is actually 10-20%. I don’t have data on that, it’s just a hunch.Many of us in the indie music industry (hip hop sustained record plants for many years, arguably until independent music started pressing in the 2000s) have mixed feelings about records. It’s a lot of plastic. A lot of waste. And they’re cubersome to bring on tour.But there isn’t another physical medium that sells at all as well as vinyl. Soft apparel always does well. But people want vinyl.I don’t love the Gen Z framing of this though. Vinyl purchasing at this point is multi generational.I don’t think it’s some mysterious Gen Z love of physical. I think we all know that Spotify doesn’t pay artists appropriately and we want to help sustain the music we love. Buying digitally is just isn’t the same for a lot of people (even though it arguably is the best and easiest income generator for artists).",

My teen daughter does the same.I have many happy memories of getting a new record as kid, laying in the floor and listening from start to finish while poring over liner notes and album art. There was a level of connection with the music that I just don’t get from listening to Spotify while I’m washing the dishes or something.I know it’s sentimental, but I get so much joy out of watching my daughter do the same thing now. She has a blast going to our local record store, finding records from her favorite bands old and new and then coming home and just listening. No devices, no distractions, just her and the music she loves. In a sometimes horrible and depressing world, it’s a sweet escape.",

Why isn't a new physical format taking hold?Something like Bandcamp-style downloads, which you put on a micro SD card.  You put the card in a 3d-printable piece of plastic, resembling a cassette case.  When you buy the download, the band sends you a printed piece of paper (the inlay for the cassette case thing) saying “limited edition run #1, Sequence Number 465/2000; thanks for your support”.  If you want to get fancy, maybe record the transaction in some kind of ledger; perhaps put the buyer's name on the band webpage as a patron.For the software, perhaps there could be something open source based on hardware like the anbernic rg355xxsp and similar devices (multipurpose, portable, hackable by design, …)It would take very little to get it established:  A critical mass of bands in some genre getting together, their fans getting on board, and things spreading from there.",

I feel I can explain myself though, or at least offer context about why I own about a dozen records and no way whatsoever to play them.I’m a recovering audiophile. I got into the hobby because I enjoy technology in its myriad aspects, and had discovered that good speakers can make things sound better. As I began accruing CDs and re-ripping into lossless audio, I also began collecting vinyls via Record Store Day events of bands or artists I found interesting at the time, or the odd Collector’s Edition bundles of albums or games. The thinking was that when I finally settled into my own place, I could invest into some Hi-Fi kit to play them back.Well, I fell out of the audiophile sphere when I got into data analysis, physics, human biology, and psychology: I had become inoculated against the bullshit that permeates the space, but still recognized the value of my album collection. I’d also pivoted into preservation, and so I began accepting relatives’ collections of older formats, like 78s. I still lacked playback mechanisms, though I now had the space and budget - just more pressing projects than a record playback setup.And so here I am in 2025, in an apartment that transmits energy between units, with an upstairs neighbor that does somersaults and tumbles all day (thus shaking the space slightly). The cost of everything has skyrocketed, but it’s no longer a matter of a turntable and a phono stage to get going (need isolation as well, and that ain’t cheap). I’ve also - shockingly - got other, more pressing projects in front of me, one of which is a bedroom Hi-Fi setup that has physical controls for music streaming instead of smartphone apps - again, not remotely cheap.Right now, my meager collection sits in a crate under the sofa, languishing.

I was always the youtube kind of guy, although I recently started listening to youtube music when I realized that my youtube feed was being impacted and youtube music's a better way to listen I guessWe really need to get to pen-drives first before CD as well I guess. Like downloading songs from youtube to run them in pen-drive or just listen to locally would show us youngsters somethingI have been recently thinking of downloading all of my songs and uploading it to some vps so that I can listen to from anywhere. I feel like steps like these with media ownership would gradually help rediscovery of CD perhaps as well as we people would really love supporting the artists then as well and buying their CD might be the way if we end up downloading their musics.Pen-drives are ubiquotus as well so perhaps we might need the pen-drive era in betweenAlso computers are absolutely removing the CD port. Even my desktop doesn't have it. I think it has the slot but I had my PC built in the store so they didnt really add it but literally no devices have CD except perhaps our car but I think even some new Cars might not have any CD'sIf someone is forced to buy a CD player just to play CD's, it just adds more friction and I would argue that Vinyl is much more so for the aesthetics itself as well which I feel like CD's aren't really that much for.So my point is, People aren't really using Vinyl for quality, they are using it for aesthetics. If CD's have a chance, they really need to get more on the ease of starting and pen-drives can help start the local-music movement.",

That's ~$300 000 adjusted for inflation.In 2024 1450 artists got over $1 000 000 in royalty from Spotify.[2] Additionally 2.3% (~276 000) earned at least $1000 and 100 000 earned at least \"almost $6000\".It seems to me that there now is a long tail of artists making a few thousand a year on Spotify that assume they would have sold tens thousands of records each year in the 90s. E.g. the 100 000th most popular artist on Spotify assuming they would have sold as well as the 1200th most popular artist in 1998.The more likely case is that the top ~10 000 artists would have made less back then than they do now and the rest would have made essentially zero dollars from selling records back in the 90s.0: https://bestsellingalbums.org/decade/1990-238\n1: https://dailybruin.com/1998/09/27/paying-the-price\n2: https://www.digitalmusicnews.com/2025/03/12/spotify-loud-and...",

A physical shop has limited space, so old stuff has to be pruned out to leave room for the new releases.

New releases may be completely unnoticed by users who follow recommendation algorithms. You can trivially follow impulses like \"So what else did the the band that made Video Killed the Radio Star make?\".Since digital is infinitely reproducible and not perishable this will keep getting worse and worse.

Many cities with short distances, and people actually show up for the show. Much more rewarding to play with actuall audience.",

In Dan's article;>A rule of thumb is that it takes five years from an American, German, or Japanese automaker to dream up a new car design and launch that model on the roads; in China, it’s closer to 18 months.Not only is China 3 - 5 times faster in terms of product launches, they would have launch it with a production scale that is at least double the output of other auto marker. If you were to put capacity into the equation as well, China is an order of magnitude faster than any competing countries, at half the cost if not even lower.Every single year since 2022 China has added more solar power capacity than the entire US solar capacity. And they are still accelerating, with the current roadmap and trend they could install double the entire US solar power capacity in a single year by 2030.CATL's Sodium Ion Battery is already in production and will be used by EVs and large scale energy storage by end of this year. The cost advantage of these new EV would mean there is partially zero chance EU can compete. And if EU are moaning about it now, they cant even imagine what is coming.Thanks to AI pushing up memory and NAND price. YMTC and CXMT now have enough breathing room to catch up. If they play this right, I wont be surprised by 2035 30 - 40% of DRAM and NAND will be made by the two Chinese firms. Although judging from their past execution record I highly doubt this will happen, but expect may be 10-15% maximum.Beyond tech, there are also other part of manufacturing that China has matched or exceeded rest of the world without being noticed by many. Lab Grown Diamond, Cosmetic Production, Agricultural Machinery, Reinforced glass etc. Their 10 years plan on agricultural improvement also come to fruition especially in terms of fruit and veg. I wont be surprised if they no long need US soy bean within 10 years time.All in all a lot of things in China has passed escape velocity and there is no turning back. China understand US better than US understand themselves, and US doesn't even have any idea about China. I think the quote from the article sums this up pretty well.\"Beijing has been preparing for Cold War without eagerness for waging it, while the US wants to wage a Cold War without preparing for it.\".[1] https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46273326",

Meanwhile in Europe, perhaps 15 percent of the electorate actively believes in degrowth. I feel it’s impossible to convince Europeans to act in their self interest.Can someone elaborate on how growth is aligned with the general interest? To my mind, although growth could _theoretically_ lead to a \"lifting all boats\" improvement across the board, in practice it inevitably leads to greater concentration of wealth for the elite while the populace deals with negative externalities like pollution, congestion, and advertizing. Degrowth, on the other hand, would directly reduce those externalities; and, if imposed via progressive taxation, would have further societal benefits via funded programs.I'd very much like to hear the counter-argument. It would be pleasant and convenient to believe that growth and industry are Good, Actually, so that I needn't feel guilty for contributing to them or for furthering my own position - but (sadly!)

I had a time 10 years ago as a tester when I filed a bug ticket with explicit steps that results in a \"broken pipe error\".

It is kind of a difference in philosophy here.One trade off is that I am not so likely to get involved in such a project. I may start a discussion, but in general I am very chaotic and may never follow up on discussions I started, simply due to lack of time, too many things to do, forgetting too much too (I do keep notes locally, but these files just keep on growing!).",

Ticketing flows typically feature a triage/reproduction stage. Just because someone creates an issue that doesn't necessarily mean the issue exists or isn't already tracked somewhere else, or that the ticket has all the necessary and sufficient information to troubleshoot an issue. When a ticket is created, the first step is to have someone look at it and check if there's something to it. This happens even when tickets are created by internal stakeholders, such as QAs.GitHub supports ticket labels, and the default set already cover these scenarios.https://docs.github.com/en/issues/using-labels-and-milestone...To me this discussion sounds like a project decided to update their workflow to move triage out of tickets and into a separate board.

This sentence, when considered alone, might be seen to imply that all trade-offs are in a sense, ok, because they are all sort of a matter of taste. This doesn't mesh with my understanding of the world. I frame it this way: for a given objective, some trade-offs are better than others.Put in reverse, when I see a project making certain trade-offs, I don't assume those trade-offs are in service of some clearly defined objective. Often I see people and organizations mired in trade-offs that are inertial and/or unconsidered.There is another interesting angle to consider: framing as a question it would be: «When building a product or running a project, how do I make sense of a huge variety of trade-offs?» For that, exploring the Pareto frontier can be a useful method (see [1]) because it reduces the combinatorial explosion.In the case of Ghostty, I think its values are indeed better served by this GitHub process (which designates an issue as a clear actionable task derived from a discussion).[1]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pareto_front",

The discussion is open and this is the system working as intended!I want to clarify though that there isn't a known widespread \"memory leak issue.\" You didn't say \"widespread\", but just in case that is taken by anyone else. :) To clarify, there are a few challenges here:1. The report at hand seems to affect a very limited number of users (given the lack of reports and information about them). There are lots of X meme posts about Ghostty in the macOS \"Force Close\" window using a massive amount of RAM but that isn't directly useful because that window also reports all the RAM _child processes_ are using (e.g. if you run a command in your shell that consumes 100 GB of RAM, macOS reports it as Ghostty using 100 GB of RAM). And the window by itself also doesn't tell us what you were doing in Ghostty. It farms good engagement, though.2. We've run Ghostty on Linux under Valgrind in a variety of configurations (the full GUI), we run all of Ghostty's unit tests under Valgrind in CI for every commit, and we've run Ghostty on macOS with the Xcode Instruments leak checker in a variety of configurations and we haven't yet been able to find any leaks. Both of these run fully clean. So, the \"easy\" tools can't find it.3. Following point 1 and 2, no maintainer familiar with the codebase has ever seen leaky behavior. Some of us run a build of Ghostty, working full time in a terminal, for weeks, and memory is stable.4. Our Discord has ~30K users, and within it, we only have one active user who periodically gets a large memory issue. They haven't been able to narrow this down to any specific reproduction and they aren't familiar enough with the codebase to debug it themselves, unfortunately. They're trying!To be clear, I 100% believe that there is some kind of leak affecting some specific configuration of users. That's why the discussion is open and we're soliciting input. I even spent about an hour today on the latest feedback (posted earlier today) trying to use that information to narrow it down. No dice, yet.If anyone has more info, we'd love to find this. :)",

      "abstract": "该讨论围绕Clicks Communicator这款带物理键盘的手机展开。核心话题是物理键盘在智能手机上的实用性与市场定位，社区观点呈现明显分歧。\n\n部分用户对物理键盘持怀疑或否定态度。有人认为实体键盘输入速度更慢、易出错，实际体验不佳；也有用户指出其定位尴尬，作为功能机过于智能，作为智能机又显局限，且语音输入等现代技术已能较好替代。讨论中还提到，这类高价但功能折中的产品容易沦为电子垃圾。\n\n另一方面，不少用户表达了兴趣与期待。有人赞赏其硬件设计，并希望摄像头等配套功能达标；也有用户认为物理键盘与折叠屏等形态结合可能带来最佳体验。部分用户明确表示，若手机能支持GrapheneOS等定制系统，他们会考虑购买。\n\n主要争议点在于产品定位：厂商将其宣传为“第二手机”，但用户质疑谁会专门为备用电键盘而携带备用机，认为它更应作为主力机。此外，有用户指出该设备最初是键盘配件，担忧其软件可能存在故障。整体而言，社区虽欣赏硬件设计，但对其实用性、系统支持及市场定位存在不同看法。",

          "content": "I had the Unihertz Titan for a while .  It was a fun experiment, but I ultimately found it too annoying for continued daily useFirst, typing was actually slower and more error prone. Even nearly a year into owning it, I was constantly misclicking and spending loads of time correcting myself.Second, you loose a ton of navigate functionality with the hardware keyboards. Holding space to navigate between characters is gone. Emojis are gone. GIF keyboards are gone.Third, none of the apps are built for this aspect ratio or screen size. Often this is just an annoyance - but there are times this became an actual, legitimate blocker. Items would be laid out off screen in a way that you couldn’t access them. The solution: a scaled view where everything was ridiculously tiny.Three B: too many situations where the virtual keyboard would come up and you’d literally have the entire screen covered.I didn’t realize how much value I lose with these issues until I experienced them. Every thing you’ve relied on essentially become unreliable because you might not be able to use certain functionality.",

The typing itself is a personal preference, of course; the keyboard needs to happen to be the right size for your hands or you're going to have a bad time. For navigating between characters, there's an excellent open source keyboard (https://github.com/palsoftware/pastiera) that provides a lot of features normally present in a soft keyboard that Unihertz didn't include in their keyboard. I switch between that and Swiftkey, though Swiftkey likes to open a full soft keyboard interface for no reason no matter how many ways I try to disable it.The aspect ratio/screen size issue is annoying, but I find that a combination of the screen lock setting (for annoying apps that rotate the screen when they go \"full screen\") combined with scrolling using the capacitive keyboard works just fine without blocking the entire screen.The one problem I have with the phone, and the reason I'm not dailying it, is that Unihertz is notoriously bad at providing software updates. I'm not too impressed with the Clicks phone either on that front, though at least they're beating Unihertz:> Communicator will run Android 16. We’re comfortable committing to 2 years of Android updates and 5 years of security updates.The clicks launcher looks pretty slick, though. I'll definitely try to run that on my Titan 2 when the APK eventually gets dumped.",

Now here comes a product that both provides a small form factor, and even better, is aimed at reducing distractions and provides features to that effect.It's running regular Android with a custom version of Niagara launcher (which it seems I need to try), and seems like it's a product built by people who want to use it. Which makes me hopeful that a lot of care was put into designing it. It seems like they're aiming it towards people that want a second device for work, which -in my mind- means there might be some compromises, so I'll be waiting for reviews to decide if it can hold up as a daily driver or not.It should be noted, they claim that the keyboard is touch sensitive and can be used for scrolling, so it might actually solve some of the usability issues that immediately come to mind.TBH, I'm a little surprised by all the hate. This might not be a product for you, or it might not speak to you for other reasons. The fact is that this company has seen success with their phone cases (I don't get it either), and has now announced two new products that should reach more of the market (the other is a magsafe slide out keyboard, it's very cool). If you don't like it, fair enough, but that doesn't mean it's a bad product.",

Art is something you ought to know for sure if you can achieve it before launching your kickstarter. (And even if the album/photo book/whatever doesn't turn out exactly how you imagined it, you can still give the backers some art of equivalent value.)Electronics are the exact opposite. Coming up with an idea and getting some renders done is at least 1,000x easier than the remaining work from idea to shipping 10,000 units, therefore it's reasonable to expect that at least 90% of kickstarters for such products will fail to deliver, leaving backers holding the bag, since all our money has been spent already on the failed attempts.Furthermore, I tend to think that if, due to some combination of their existing reputation + the amount of the work they've already completely finished, the project were a safe bet, then they'd be able to get investors to front them any further needed startup funds the normal way.",

(CVE-2025-20700, CVE-2025-20701, CVE-2025-20702)This includes firmware dumps, user preferences, Bluetooth Classic session keys, current playing track, ...> Examples of affected vendors and devices are Sony (e.g., WH1000-XM5, WH1000-XM6, WF-1000XM5), Marshall (e.g. Major V, Minor IV), Beyerdynamic (e.g. AMIRON 300), or Jabra (e.g. Elite 8 Active).Most vendors gave the security researchers either silent treatment or were slow, even after Airoha published fixes. Jabra was one of the positive outlier, Sony unfortunately negatively.What is exciting, even though the flaws are awful, that it is unlikely for current generation of those Airoha bluetooth headsets to change away from Aiorha's Bluetooth LE \"RACE\" protocol. This means there is great opportunity for Linux users to control their Bluetooth headsets, which for example is quite nice in an office setting to toggle \"hearthrough\" when toggling volume \"mute\" on your machine.RACE Reverse Engineered - CLI Tool: https://github.com/auracast-research/race-toolkitI feel like this should receive state-level attention, the remote audio surveillance of any headset can be a major threat. I wonder what the policies in countries official buildings are when it comes to Bluetooth audio devices, considering that Jabra is a major brand for conference speakers, I'd assume some actual espionage threats.",

          "content": "From a security point of view music listening is quite marginal, I think. The vulnerable headsets make conversations trivial to eavesdrop.Average communication input is in a noisy environment (colleagues, family, wind, equipment, car), and is compressed both in the dynamic range and bitrate sense before sending out. The transport medium then provides latency and packet loss. The fidelity of the audio equipment on the receiving side plays very little role. I imagine even audiophiles quite readily use even below mid-range wireless headsets for conversations, just because they are more convenient.In other words, I don't take calls on my wired AKG headphones, even though my phone has a 3.5mm jack. I'm particularly fond of my €30 in-ear BT headset that provides good enough input and output even when I'm biking. I can't be bothered to check if the model is on the vulnerable devices list, the phone company / Meta / Alphabet / some governments and so on can surveil my communications anyway. Adding a random passer-by to the mix does not meaningfully increase the attack surface. Plus they might get to listen to awesome music, if I'm not on a call.",

I chose hledger (because of possible performance issues with beancount). I learned double-entry bookkeeping (it's pretty simple, honestly). I write Python scripts to import investment statements sent in PDF format (broker does not support transaction downloads) and pay stubs (payroll company does not do transaction downloads) and CSV imports for bank and credit card statements which lets me autocategorize most transactions. Turns out it's exactly what I wanted all this time I just didn't know it.I spend about an hour each month updating accounts. I generate investment reports, budget reports, and tax summaries. It's all there, except tracking the ACB of my investments (which I probably could do except a simple spreadsheet is less effort). Everything I need for my coming retirement this year.And because it's plain text I will never have to lose everything when data formats change due to new upstream releases.

In particular, you DONT need to learn double entry to do plain text accounting. Of course, you SHOULD learn double entry accounting because it's a great tool for organizing knowledge.Whether plain text is beneficial for accounting is less clear cut in my mind. I think plain text is backlash against the over-reliance on \"services\", \"clouds\", and \"lock in\", but I think it's misguided. If you're concerned with someone locking you in, it's perfectly concievable to do double entry accounting which lives only on your computer and manipulated with software that is under your control (read: free software).So in summary, my opinon is:- accounting: important- double entry: important- avoid clouds and ventor lock in: important- avoid proprietary file formats: important- plain text: unimportant(I use GnuCash.

I think the barrier to entry is high because you first need to learn double entry bookkeeping  (if you haven't already) and then you need to decide between ledger-cli, hledger, or beancount, with the differentiators being on the margins and with some promise of being able to switch later. The choice really comes down to which tool has the documentation/community that makes the most sense to you at the time.Then, there's the import workflow: which \"accounts\" should you start with? How much history do you pull in? How do you set up an automatic importer? Hledger has a DSL. Beancount uses Python. Either way, an OP says, much of your time is spent manually editing text.And finally, then what? Can I make a budget now? Will this thing do my taxes? Am I more financially responsible? How do I explain this to my spouse? My pension is kind of like a commodity, but I don't know what the unit price is, and I don't sell units, but what's a virtual PnL and what if I only have a quarterly PDF!?It may sound like I'm ranting, but I have found that realizing I don't know the answers to these questions (or even that they exist) is the true benefit of PTA.Every year, I'm asked if I want a different pension investment mix or if I want to change my car insurance. Or, I might wonder if I'm getting a good deal on my internet plan or if a new job offer's total comp is actually better. Am I \"on track\" for \"retirement,\" how long until I have enough for a new roof, am I keeping up with inflation, did I spend too much on gifts this year?There's immense privilege in not really needing to know the answers to these questions; getting them \"wrong\" won't really hurt you. But, being familiar with the routine minutiae of your economy by way of counting every cent, is rewarding, enlightening, and empowering—even if it's also finicky and brittle sometimes.I may have to try beancount again.

Maybe that's enough for most people, but for me I want everything, investments, liabilities, assets etc. None of these commercial offerings have that because it's so complex and niche, e.g. your open banking provider won't tell you how your pension is doing.It's also just nice to have the provenance of transactions, e.g. if you receive some shares from work, and you sell the shares and the money ends up in your bank account - the incoming transaction will just be the net proceeds but it won't tell you if you paid any tax prior to that - PTA gives you a more of a complete picture that tracks the whole chain of events that led up that transaction into your bank happening.

You don't have to import anything, it's plain text.

You can have automation with or without plain text.Second, your emphasis on \"automation\" leads me to believe that perhaps you misunderstand what accounting is. Accounting is not just taking a list of transactions and recording them (database, file etc). That is called bookkeeping. Yes, accounting is also amenable to automation, but much less so than bookkeeping. Although, you could argue that when applied to the life of a normal individual, accounting and bookkeeping are almost indistinguishable. You have income, you have costs, and you have a mortgage - pretty straightforward. My point is in general you cannot entirely automate accounting. The reason for that is that accounting isn't just processing bytes, but instead requires the understanding of the underlying economics associated with the transactions. This understanding in turn isn't stored anywhere other than the accountant's mental model of the entity he's doing the accounting for.EDIT: Just to be clear, I don't disagree with you that accounting could use more automation. Everything could use more automation. But for something it's more straightforward than others.",

I've only ever used these to produce reports (read, reports different from the ones provided by the UI). However I believe it's also possible to do things like inserting transactions via these python wrappers.Another example of something which is possible via the python wrappers is labels. GnuCash doesn't support labels, but it supports adding general text to each transaction and to each leg of each transaction. So you can e.g. use hashtags in the text, and then consume transactions into python and aggregate on these hashtags, making them effectively labels.",

It was reasonably short, like the kind of problem an experienced developer could do in 10-15 minutes and then add some polish, documentation, and submit it in under an hour.Even though I told candidates that we’d discuss their submission as part of the next step, we would still get candidates submitting solutions that seemed entirely foreign to them a day later. This was on the cusp of LLMs being useful, so I think a lot of solutions were coming from people’s friends or copied from something on the internet without much thought.Now that LLMs are both useful and well known, the temptation to cheat with them is huge. For various reasons I think students and applicants see using LLMs as not-cheating in the same situations where they wouldn’t feel comfortable copying answers from a friend. The idea is that the LLM is an available tool and therefore they should be able to use it. The obvious problem with that argument is that we’re not testing students or applicants on their abilities to use an LLM, we’re using synthetic problems to explore their own skills and communication.Even some of the hiring managers I know who went all in on allowing LLMs during interviews are changing course now. The LLM-assisted interviewed were just turning into an exercise of how familiar the candidate was with the LLM being used.I don’t really agree with some of the techniques they’re using in this article, but the problem they’re facing is very real.",

Though, maybe in that case the trigger was not just the tone of professor, but the sheer difference in the tone he used normally (very friendly) and at the exam time. It was absolutely unexpected at my first exam, and the repeated exposure to it didn't help. I'd say it was becoming worse with each time. Today I'd overcome such issues easily, I know some techniques today, but I didn't when I was green.OTOH I wonder, if an AI could have such an effect on me.

Far from ideal, we just never got anything better, how else can you measure a student's worth?Well, now you could just run all of that student's activity in class through that AI. In the real world you don't know if someone is competent because you run an exam, you know if he is competent because he consistently shows competency. Exams are a proxy for that, you can't have a teacher looking at a student 24/7 to see they know their stuff, except now you can gather the data and parse it, what do I care if a student performs 10 exercises poorly in a specific day at a specific time if they have shown they can do perfectly well, as can be ascertained by their performance the past week?",

On the one hand, other commenters' experiences provide additional evidence that oral communication is a vastly different skill from the written word and ought to be emphasized more in education. Even if a student truly understands a concept, they might struggle at talking about it in a realtime context. For many real-world cases, this is unacceptable. Therefore the skill needs to be taught.On the other hand, can an AI exam really simulate the conditions necessary for improving at this skill? I think this is unlikely. The students' responses indicate not a general lack of expertise in oral communication but also a discomfort with this particular environment. While the author is making steps to improve the environment, I think it is fundamentally too different from actual human-to-human discussion to test a student's ability in oral communication. Even if a student could learn to succeed in this environment, it won't produce much improvement in their real world ability.But maybe that's not the goal, and it's simply to test understanding. Well, as other commenters have stated, this seems trivially cheatable. So it neither succeeds at improving one's ability in oral communication nor at testing understanding.

Strategies that work well for M.I.T. with competitive enrollment and large budgets won't work for a small community college in an agricultural state, with large teaching loads per professor, no TAs, and about 15-25 hours of committee or other non-teaching work.  That was my situation.Teaching five courses and eight sections, 20-30 students per section, 10-20 office hours every week (and often more if the professor cared about the students), leaves little time for grading.  In desperation I turned to weekly homework assignments, 4-6 programming projects, and multiple choice exams (containing code and questions about it).

That \"take-home exams are dead\" is self-evident, not a result of the experiment in the article.

It doesn't mean \"you don't have to talk to the IRB\", it means \"there's a little less oversight but you still need to file all the paperwork\". Here's one university's explanation[1]:> Exempt human subjects research is a specific sub-set of “research involving human subjects” that does not require ongoing IRB oversight. Research can qualify for an exemption if it is no more than minimal risk and all of the research procedures fit within one or more of the exemption categories in the federal IRB regulations. *Studies that qualify for exemption must be submitted to the IRB for review before starting the research. Pursuant to NU policy, investigators do not make their own determination as to whether a research study qualifies for an exemption — the IRB issues exemption determinations.* There is not a separate IRB application form for studies that could qualify for exemption – the appropriate protocol template for human subjects research should be filled out and submitted to the IRB in the eIRB+ system.Most of my research is in CS Education, and I have often been able to get my studies under the Exempt status. This makes my life easier, but it's still a long arduous paperwork process. Often there are a few rounds to get the protocol right. I usually have to plan studies a whole semester in advance. The IRB does NOT like it when you decide, \"Hey I just realized I collected a bunch of data, I wonder what I can do with it?\" They want you to have a plan going in.[1] https://irb.northwestern.edu/submitting-to-the-irb/types-of-...",

And then some lights: brake warning lamp (but the bulb is burnt out and doesn't seem replacable), high beam indicator, alternator indicator, turn signal indicator (one led for both directions!), low oil pressure indicator, and EGR indicator which really just turns on 10,000 miles after you push the button on the box under the front of the car.Don't even need a tach, cause they put one dot on the speedo where you should shift out of first, two dots where you should shift out of second, and three dots where you should shift out of third.The gauge lights come on when the headlights are on, so that's a subtle indicator too, I guess.Don't really need much more than that.

If you can not understand why this very minor (but loud?) note was made, then you probably do not do any serious video encoding or you would know why it sucks today and is well past its prime. VLC is glorified because it was a video player that used to be amazing back in the day, but hasn't been for several years now. It is the Firefox of media players.There is a reason why the Anime community has collectively has ditched VLC in favor of MPV and MPC-HC. Color reproduction, modern codec support, ASS subtitle rendering, and even audio codecs are janky or even broken on VLC. 98% of all Anime encode release playback problems are caused by the user using VLC.We even have a dedicated pastebin on a quick run down of what is wrong: https://rentry.co/vee-ell-ceeAnd this pastebin doesn't even have all the issues. VLC has a long standing issue of not playing back 5.1 Surround sound Opus correctly or at all. VLC is still using FFmpeg 4.x. We're on FFmpeg 8.x these daysI can not even use VLC to take screenshots of videos I encode because the color rendering on everything is wrong. BT.709 is very much NOT new and predates VLC itself.And you can say \"VLC is easy to install and the UI is easy.\" Yeah so is IINA for macOS, Celluloid for Linux, and MPV.net for Windows which all use MPV underneath. Other better and easy video players exist today.We are not in 2012 anymore. We are no longer just using AVC/H264 + AAC or AC-3 (Dolby Audio) MP4s for every video. We are playing back HEVC, VP9, and AV1 with HDR metadata in MKV/webm cnotainers with audio codecs like Opus or HE-AACv3 or TrueHD in surround channels, BT.2020 colorspaces. VLC's current release is made of libraries and FFmpeg versions that predate some of these codecs/formats/metadata types. Even the VLC 4.0 nightly alpha is not keeping up. 4.0 is several years late to releasing and when it does, it may not even matter.",

Like yes, I know HDR = high dynamic range = bigger difference between light and dark, but what technical changes were needed to accomplish this?The way I understand it, we've got the YCbCr that is being converted to an RGB value which directly corresponds to how bright we drive the R, G, and B subpixels. So wouldn't the entire range already be available? As in, post-conversion to RGB you've got 256 levels for each channel which can be anywhere from 0 to 255 or 0% to 100%? We could go to 10-bit color which would then give you finer control with 1024 levels per channel instead of 256, but you still have the same range of 0% to 100%. Does the YCbCr -> RGB conversion not use the full 0-255 range in RGB?Naturally, we can stick brighter backlights in our monitors to make the difference between light and dark more significant, but that wouldn't change the on-disk or on-the-wire formats. Those formats have changed (video files are specifically HDR or SDR and operating systems need to support HDR to drive HDR monitors), so clearly I am missing something but all of my searches only find people comparing the final image without digging into the technical details behind the shift. Anyone care to explain or have links to a good source of information on the topic?",

There are hardware encoders that might be distribution quality, but these are (to my knowledge) expensive ASICs that Netflix, Amazon, Google, etc. use to accelerate encode (not necessarily to realtime) and improve power efficiency.GPU acceleration could be used to accelerate a CPU encode in a quality-neutral way, but NVENC and the various other HW accelerators available to end users are designed for realtime encoding for broadcast or for immediate storage (for example, to an SD card).For distribution, you can either distribute the original source (if bandwidth and space are no concern), or you can ideally encode in a modern, efficient codec like x265 or AV1. AV1 might be particularly useful if you have a noisy source, since denoising and classification of the noise is part of the algorithm.

For a given bandwidth, we want to efficiently allocate color encoding as well as brightness (logarithmically to capture the huge dynamic range of perceptible light). sRGB is one such standard that we've all agreed upon, and output devices all ostensibly shoot for the sRGB target, but may also interpret the signal however they'd like. This is inevitable, to account for the fact that not all output devices are equally capable. HDR is another set of standards that aims to expand the dynamic range, while also pinning those values to actual real-life brightness values. But again, TVs and such may interpret those signals in wildly different ways, as evidenced by the wide range of TVs that claim to have \"HDR\" support.This was probably not the most accurate explanation, but hopefully it's enough to point you in the right direction.",

CRTs always had a residual glow that caused blacks to be grays. It was very hard to get true black on a CRT unless it was off and had been for some time. It wasn't until you could actually have no light from a pixel where black was actually black.Sony did a demo when they released their OLED monitors where they had the top of each monitor type side by side: CRT, LCD, OLED. The CRT was just gray while the OLED was actually black. To the point that I was thinking in my head that surely this is a joke and the OLED wasn't actually on. That's precisely when the narrator said \"and just to show that the monitors are all on\" as the video switched to a test pattern.As for the true question you're getting at, TFA mentions things like color matrix, primaries, and transfer settings in the file. Depending on the values, the decoder makes decision on the math used to calculate the values. You can use  any of the values on the same video and arrive at different results. Using the wrong ones will make your video look bad, so ensuring your file has the correct values is important.From TFA: https://gist.github.com/arch1t3cht/b5b9552633567fa7658deee5a...",

I wouldn't use Python to run an airplane, but I really don't see why you wouldn't care about the resources just because you're working with an interpreted or GC language.",

Dev reaches for JSON because it's easy and ubiquitous.2. Dev switches to BONJSON because it's more efficient and requires no changes to their code other than changing the codec library.3.

I learned a ton doing it but it has just gotten too awful to carry on.It was faster to rg to search files, drop into WSL and run find for file name searches. The start menu was laggy, explorer was laggy (open up a folder with a couple dozen OGG files and it won't render for a solid minute). Mystery memory usage from privileged processes I had little control over. Once I realized that the one game I play (Overwatch) ran on Linux I decided to swap back.I installed Linux Mint earlier this year and I've been extremely happy. The memory consumption is stable and low, and if something is broken I have the control to fix it. It just feels so much less hostile.

I had XMMS which looked just like Winamp, and Sega/Nintendo emulation and even Duke Nukem 3D. For programs I had epub/pdf/djview readers, xpaint which is like classic MS Paint, feh as a hyperlightweight all purpose image viewer and background manager, a super lightweight RSI break popup program, and even  a fully functional web server stack. It also had a window manager (JWM) that handled multiple desktops more intuitively and effortlessly than Windows does now.",

But that doesn't mean that the \"workers\" model wouldn't fit, and indeed I suspect that using a workers model would help folk architect their stuff in a form that is not only more performant, but also more amenable to edge placement.",

      "abstract": "该讨论围绕Punkt公司新发布的MC03智能手机展开，核心争议在于其高价与订阅模式是否合理。多数用户对这款设备持批评态度，认为其定价过高且功能受限。有人认为每月10欧元的订阅费加上700欧元的手机价格令人难以接受，尤其是考虑到操作系统仍较为封闭。也有用户指出，该公司此前以物理键盘和极简设计吸引小众用户，但新款转向订阅制可能背离了原有用户群体的期待。讨论中提到，欧洲市场对WhatsApp的依赖进一步限制了此类非主流手机的实用性，使其难以推广。尽管有用户表示理解付费获取系统更新的商业模式，但普遍共识是MC03的性价比不足，且订阅模式可能损害用户权益。此外，关于其操作系统是否基于过时的GrapheneOS版本也存在技术性质疑。整体上，社区对该产品持谨慎或否定态度。",

We get the updates for \"free\" but we actually already paid them when we paid the device.Meanwhile, here it's clear: you pay the device, and then you pay for the OS.The opposite being the product like with Microsoft/Google.Or relying on the goodwill of other people (FOSS).If I take the example of Kagi, I saw how much impact as a customer I have/had on the product.Meanwhile Microsoft/Google/Apple don't care.And on FOSS I could _just_ do the things myself, but I'm not an OS dev and I already spend some time on other FOSS projects (I'm writing this message on an Linux computer).\nDonations are great but they are not reliable/predictable and they don't give you more power to influence the product.Regarding your question \"Why do I need to pay to retain data that is on my own device?\", according to their FAQ:\n\"Without an active subscription, certain core services and privacy features will be limited. To keep your MC03 fully functional, secure, and up to date, an active subscription is required.\"\nhttps://www.punkt.ch/products/mc03-premium-secure-smartphoneSo the phone won't brick itself and you won't lose access to your data.But the company itself give me a bad feeling, like Proton, trying to surf the hype and doing lots of virtue signaling.",

A lot of these dumb phones rely on generalist components I think and they aren't bankrolled with bajillions of dollars to get new R&D going and tooling online to really put an impressive device together, I just never see it in these \"disconnect but stay just connected enough\" dumb-phones that are trying to offer an exit from the noise of modern smart phones.i'd absolutely cherish something that had the form of the nokia xpress music 5310 https://news.softpedia.com/images/extra/MOBILE/large/Nokia_5... with gps navigation, the ability to play music, and workplace MFA capability.that's it, i've thought about it and i seriously don't need anything else. yeah whatsapp and spotify are super ubiquitous these days but they're literally not required to get in touch with me. and for spotify, i finally did do that whole \"nerd mods an ipod 15 years later thing\" and it taught me something that i needed to know about myself: ADHD + spotify = bad. my last decades playlists are a mess, i listen to music _less_ because it's just an onslaught of new stuff and access to everything. something about having a collection of music i actually took time to curate into playlists..i know what's in there i know what i can listen to. it's somewhere between meditative (which is good for me) and very intentional. acquiring new music is now also very intentional, getting it onto my device is intentional. its slower, less convenient, and somehow it makes me enjoy the music experience a lot more. im listening to more music now in a way that I haven't since I was sitting on a schoolbus next to my crush and sharing a headphone with her.all in all I've seen a few of these \"dumb phones, no distraction\" device manufs now like punkt here start off with a cool design and eventually just cave and fold to some full screen touch design. to me that just nixes a lot of checkboxes for me: more screen = undoubtedly more distractions and ways to be connected, i miss buttons, i just... don't want a big phone. ever. i want to be intentional about my connectivity, and that means if i need the internet i need to just go hop on my computer. if im itching to know something and im standing in an elevator or standing on a subway, i actually don't want to be able to pull my phone out and have the immediacy of an answer. i want to stay bored in my head, work on the skill of \"this is important i hope i come back to it lets index that thought and come back to it later\", and just learn to live with being in my own head without the constant need to have an answer or scratch a dopamine itch immediately. there's something ive completely lost over the years, basically that ability to imagine spiderman swinging from the powerlines when i was a kid looking out the window of my parents car. whatever _that_ is, i think that came with a lot of core benefits for my brain activity that generally allowed me to have a more meaningful and happier life.",

That's 600-1200kwDC, given its flat, at 800kwp/kWh, that means for an hour of peak production, after losses, would do at least 300kwh for the smaller size and 600kwh for the larger size. If each trip is around 1150kwh and takes longer than an hour, more than half of the power required could be generated. As solar modules are solid-state devices, seems short sighted to not slam a system on the roof. PV modules are literally just glass sandwiches with wires and DC to DC battery chargers are very efficient. The weight would also be partly counter-acted by using the modules as the skin for the roof.",

In each port is a tower with a robot arm that connects the charging cable automatically every time the ship comes to the dock. The system charges 10.5 kV, 600Amp and 10.5MW. The batteries have a total capacity of 4,160 kWh, which means that we always have a surplus of electricity if for some reason we cannot load during a stop or if the transit takes more time than usual.In Helsingör the ferries charge for approx. 6 minutes and in Helsingborg the ferries charge for approx. 9 minutes.

The time after finishing school is more blocky: a few years working in certain places, meeting my wife and having kids. My adult life takes up more calendar time, but less \"experienced time\". My cousin was on a chat last night, explaining that his day is taken up by taking three kids to different schools, then picking them up again. Over and over, but somehow it is one experience. Plenty of people will tell you the same about going to work.By contrast, you remember things in your youth that happened only once, like spraining my ankle at a crossing with a train oncoming (it was less dramatic that it sounds lol), or going to a music festival, or finishing high school.One thing that maybe needs to be talked about is that you can simply relive your life. This works best if you had a good time. So the answer to the question is not just that you should look for new firsts, you can replay some old tapes.I'm lucky enough that I know people from every time in my life. I have a chat group with three other guys that I met when we were 4 years old, over 40 years ago. They sent messages last night. I got a message from my first grade teacher, and my high school English teacher. I have a chat with all my buddies from school, where we exchange messages that are about as mature as when we were teenagers. People I worked with, I keep in touch with.I have an online photo album that is basically the only data I care to have a backup of. Now and again, I flip through it, and I see what I was up to, and have nice thoughts about that.It might sound a bit weird for a mid-40s guy to be so resigned to being old. But I was talking to one of the mentioned buddies from nursery, and I turns out the big milestones have happened already. We already finished school, got jobs, had kids. There's a lot of little things to tick off, but they are little things: visiting various interesting sites, going to some concert, and so on.",

If time goes faster because your life has fewer firsts and more routine, then it can be extended by adding firsts. You can learn new things, travel, take up hobbies, or new careers.> This works, to a point, but there are only so many firsts for you, and chasing this exclusively seems to lead to resentment. You remember the things you had as a kid. You remember the excitement and warmth of that world, how immediate and raw everything felt, and you want to go back. You start to regret that the world has changed, even though what changed the most is you.I like to think that life slows down once you form a stable image and story of yourself. The more you convince yourself that that image is fixed, the faster time will go by. That might justify why childhood seems longer, since that image seems to form around adolescence.Experiencing new \"firsts\" but keeping that image of yourselfe fixed just works for a while. That is why it may lead to resentment, as the article says.So dont fool yourself: some image of who you are gives you some stability, but just use it for that, so that you dont run crazy with options.If you treat every event as something that might reshape your ego, then suddenly a big number of experiences are new, and time suddenly slows dont.

In middle age, “no matter how I try, those years just flow by, like a broken down dam.” For a 5 year old, a year was a fifth of their life, and feels like it. For a 40 year old, it is just another year.I think this explanation is true but incomplete. I believe it's also related to Critical Flicker Fusion Frequency [0], the way I see it, if an organism is smaller it has a higher frequency, it sees more image per second, therefore perception of time is slower. (E.g. a fly sees you moving really slowly). Maybe it's related to the processing time of images, with smaller brains insect can process more of them per second.Maybe humans process more images as children, therefore see the time time going slower.It's been a while I didn't think about this, maybe some studies have been made in the past years.[0] https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flicker_fusion_threshold",

The brief moments of mental freedom are often terrorized by the anxiety induced by what we consumed during our phone binges. Let's add some degree of sleep deprivation into the mix.

And I say that as someone who thrives in doing the same routine every day. I get my variety in the details, doing different projects, having different conversations, trying new foods, exploring new places.>  Childhood memories have an intensity and a vibrancy that it is difficult for the rest of life to match.I've found that we all have different memories. I know people who cannot remember their childhood at all, and I've known people who remember it well. But not having vibrant memories of your adult life? That feels a little depressing.  Adulthood is when you step up and become your own self, directing your own life. It is when I climbed mountains, explored the world, met new people, tried different careers, moved to new towns, had long-term relationships including children, created art, studied subjects beyond the standard high school education. Childhood was OK, but was fairly anxiety-filled, at least for me. The truly amazing experiences in life were as an adult.The author addresses this, of course. But he does so in a really odd way:> This works, to a point, but there are only so many firsts for you, and chasing this exclusively seems to lead to resentment. You remember the things you had as a kid. You remember the excitement and warmth of that world, how immediate and raw everything felt, and you want to go back.This is where my reaction was: \"Dude, wat??\" If adult experiences make you resentful, something is really off. If a good experience makes you wish you could go back to being a child, I'd be recommending therapy because that is not the reaction most adults have to new experiences. I don't say that to be mean, either - if your childhood memories are that much stronger than adult ones, that is not the typical human experience, and I would sincerely be asking for medical and psych support to figure out if something is wrong.",

I also took a year completely off work in 2016, that one also passed very quickly.If anything, having new experiences is what seems to slow down time in my experience.  Visiting new locations, doing and learning new things.  I suppose more things will be new to the young than the old, so it would make sense as an alternative hypothesis.I've also had a bad tooth ache since the day before Christmas I haven't been able to get dealt with since all the local dentists are off, and it feels like it's been the longest week in my life.  Dunno if I'd recommend it as a way of prolonging the subjective experience of time though.Another anecdote is that last year I quit coffee cold turkey, and a side effect was that time seemed to slow down significantly.  A lot of people seem to be reporting this.  Make of it what you want.  Quitting coffee also sucks quite a lot, though not as bad as week of severe tooth ache.",

For software engineers, it's AI agent prompt engineering and data modeling, according to use cases defined by business needs.You need to put on your entrepreneurial hat and figure out how to do things faster, with greater accuracy, relevant to business needs - not navel-gazing at package management and build automation exclusively.This is, of course, an extremely naïve view of the state of things, though I cannot imagine, as a generalist, how one could survive with increasingly niche skills that, a decade ago, would have commanded six-figure salaries.Good luck!",

          "content": "Funny story: in 2025 I interviewed with multiple Ruby/Rails companies in San Francisco. I performed really well in the interviews. For one company, I went through a full on-site interview at their office. And still — no offer. The interview went great.I have ~20 years of experience. I wrote a book about Ruby. I have GitHub repositories with thousands of stars. I have my own successful projects written in Ruby/Rails. I’ve spoken at conferences and contributed a lot to the Ruby/Rails community. I was a perfect match — and I still wasn’t hired.This wasn’t a one-off. The same thing happened with several Ruby/Rails startups.You know what I did next? I switched to Gen/Applied AI. And the difference was huge. The feedback became much better, and salaries were 25–50% higher. The tech itself wasn’t that different — mostly dynamic languages. I had to learn new things, but it took months, not years.I also pushed myself deeper toward understanding AI properly. I genuinely enjoy this space. I started learning the fundamentals and even built my own learning materials (for example, howllmworks.com). You don’t need to go that deep to get hired, but I wanted to. The field is fascinating.What’s funny is that many companies hiring “AI engineers” don’t really know what they’re doing. I’ve had interviews where they openly said: “We don’t really have AI expertise, but we know we need AI.” That’s how things are right now. It’s both good and bad. They can’t really judge your skills properly — but that also means your chances of passing are higher.As for the Ruby/Rails world — I’m honestly very disappointed. The market feels completely saturated. There are too many experienced engineers competing for too few roles. Being good is no longer enough.One company literally told me my interview performance was too good. They suspected I was using AI. That was the feedback. Twenty years of experience, open-source work, a published book — none of that mattered. “You’re too good, and there are too many candidates like you.” That’s how I understood it.I’ve seen this happen repeatedly. It’s not just one bad experience.At this point, I genuinely believe the Ruby/Rails ecosystem is shrinking. The whole “one-person framework” idea that DHH has been promoting made sense years ago, but not anymore. The problems it was solving simply don’t exist in the same way today.With LLMs, the world changed. You take the best tools available. Next.js with standardized React components instead of Stimulus and Turbo. Hosted auth instead of rolling your own. When I needed to integrate something like Clerk, I just dropped in a component and moved on. There are tons of ready-made solutions in the React ecosystem.Now compare that to Ruby. Are there modern AI libraries? Yes, technically. Are they well-maintained? Not really. You’re often dealing with abandonware. LangChain officially supports Python and TypeScript — not Ruby. And like it or not, AI today is happening in Python.The more time you spend clinging to Ruby/Rails, the further behind you get. That’s just reality. My advice is simple: if you can, move on. The opportunity window in AI is wide open right now, but it won’t stay that way forever. 2026 is probably the last really good entry point.",

          "content": "> What’s funny is that many companies hiring “AI engineers” don’t really know what they’re doing. I’ve had interviews where they openly said: “We don’t really have AI expertise, but we know we need AI.” That’s how things are right now. It’s both good and bad. They can’t really judge your skills properly — but that also means your chances of passing are higher.A lot of money is being thrown around at AI, it's a good time to open a company :) I agree.> As for the Ruby/Rails world — I’m honestly very disappointed. The market feels completely saturated. There are too many experienced engineers competing for too few roles. Being good is no longer enough.Ruby/Rails, and other platforms NEED deep AI integration. That wave is coming.I am surprised that people don't do a rails new for their new startups. I still see it as the king of web frameworks.> With LLMs, the world changed. You take the best tools available. Next.js with standardized React components instead of Stimulus and Turbo. Hosted auth instead of rolling your own. When I needed to integrate something like Clerk, I just dropped in a component and moved on. There are tons of ready-made solutions in the React ecosystem.Show me those ready made solutions? I haven't used them commercially so I can't vouch for them> Now compare that to Ruby. Are there modern AI libraries? Yes, technically. Are they well-maintained? Not really. You’re often dealing with abandonware. LangChain officially supports Python and TypeScript — not Ruby. And like it or not, AI today is happening in Python.True, I should probably ship something in Python and just add that to my inventory.> The more time you spend clinging to Ruby/Rails, the further behind you get. That’s just reality. My advice is simple: if you can, move on. The opportunity window in AI is wide open right now, but it won’t stay that way forever. 2026 is probably the last really good entry point.I agree with you! time to move to new pastures",

[1]From the referer (sic) data in my web server logs (which is not completely reliable but still offers some insight), the three largest sources of traffic to my website are:1. RSS feeds - People using RSS aggregator services as well as local RSS reader tools.2. Newsletters - I was surprised to discover just how many tech newsletters there are on the Web and how active their user bases are. Once in a while, a newsletter picks up one of my silly or quirky posts, which then brings a large number of visits from its followers.3. Search engines - Traffic from Google, DuckDuckGo, Bing and similar search engines. This is usually for specific tools, games and HOWTO posts available on my website that some visitors tend to return to repeatedly.[1] https://susam.net/from-web-feed-to-186850-hits.html",

RSS订阅源——包括使用RSS聚合服务及本地RSS阅读工具的用户\n2. 邮件通讯——我惊讶地发现网络上竟有如此多的技术类邮件通讯，且用户活跃度极高。偶尔有通讯转载我那些看似随意或古怪的帖子，就能从其订阅者中带来大量访问\n3. 搜索引擎——来自谷歌、DuckDuckGo、必应等搜索引擎的流量。这类访问通常针对我网站上的特定工具、游戏和操作指南类内容，有些访客会反复回访查阅\n\n[1] https://susam.net/from-web-feed-to-186850-hits.html"

          "content": "One of the biggest steps down in Facebook history was their removal of RSS syndication. There was a time in the past when you could subscribe your Facebook account to external RSS feeds. The entries in those feeds would create new content on your \"Facebook wall\". This essentially let you use any third party that supported RSS to publish content into your Facebook feed.Facebook removed that feature. The effect of this was that people had to create content within facebook instead of outside it. This reoriented the flow of content creation so that it must originate inside of Facebook, removing the ability to use FB as a passive consumer of content created in a workflow where the creators chose the entire flow.IMHO this is one of the biggest steps down ever in FB history. It was one of the biggest attacks on the open web, and I'm sad to say that it mostly worked, and the internet at large is worse as a result.",

For us, it was motivated by a few reasons:- we trained the community around us to look to our website first for the most recent news and information- we did not want a social media platform to be able to cut us off from our community (on purpose or accident) by shuttering accounts or groups- we did not want to require our users have accounts on any 3rd party platforms in order to access our postings- but we still wanted to distribute our messaging across any platforms where large groups of our community members frequently engagedAnother aspect of our process that was specific to our situation and outside of POSSE - we only posted one topic/issue/announcement per blog post. We had a news letter that would summarize each of these. Many organizations like ours would post summaries of many things to a single blog post, basically the same as the newsletter. However, this was cumbersome. For example, if someone in the community had a question, it was much clearer to link to a single post on our site that answered the question AND ONLY answered that question. It made for much better community engagement, better search engine indexing, cleaner content management, and just a better experience for everyone involved.",

Can you just go to Amazon, buy the Blu Ray, and somehow release your own? What about the anti-piracy measures on the Blu Ray? What about the work that Transit Film did in restoring the film from the original negative? Does that count as some sort of newly original work? It's a silent film and a foreign film. How does the soundtrack and translation work?If you have to make a new copy from the original reels, what if someone is hoarding them?

I’ve heard proposals for exponentially growing fees to allow truly big enterprises to stay copywritten longer, like 14+14 with filing and $100, another 14 for $100,000, another 14 for $10M, another 14 for $100M. That would allow 70 years or protection for a few key pieces of IP that are worth it, which seems like an okay trade off?I've always been a fan of this, but here's a great detraction:> I think would diminish independent author rights. Quite often, a novel will become popular only decades after publishing, and I think the author should be able to profit on the fruits of their labour without wealthy corporations tarnishing their original IP, or creating TV shows and the link with no reperations to the creator. Fantasy book are a good example. A Games of Thrones was first released in 1996 but had middling success. It was only after 2011 that the series exploded in popularity. Good Omens main peak was ~15 years after release. Hell, some books like Handmaiden's Tale were published in 1985 but only reached their peak in 2010. IP law was originally to protect artist and authors from the wealthy, but now it seems to have the opposite intent.This is a very solid point. Works sometimes only become popular decades after their initial release.Perhaps a way to protect individual artists would be to limit the number of copyrights held by a particular entity. The more you aggregate or hold on to, the steeper the cost to maintain the copyright. I'm sure loopholes like \"we're a holding company of holding companies\" might be invented to counter this, but if we tied this to real people rather than corporations it might work.Copyrights shouldn't last longer than humans.",

If the studio has those negatives in a vault, then you're cooked.Didn't Bill Gates or some others buy up thousands of old artworks and put them on ice so they could paywall the scans?",

          "content": "In case anyone is curious about _why_ light bends when it enters a lens:First, light apparently slows down in some materials because the photons are constantly interacting with electrons, and these interactions create secondary waves that are slightly out of phase with the original light. The end result is a modified wave that effectively travels more slowly. So light going in a straight line through air travels more quickly than light going through a lens.Second, getting more into quantum physics, light typically follows the shortest path from one point to another because that path tends to provide the most constructive interference between different possible routes. (The \"why\" of this is more involved; Feynman's book QED gives a good intro.)Third, if you imagine a lifeguard running to rescue someone in the ocean, then they will take the fastest path, which is not directly toward the person in the ocean. Rather, they will run a bit more on the beach in order to have to swim less because travel through the water is slower. The end result is piecewise linear = two straight lines of travel, with a bend at the water line.To summarize, you can ask \"_why_ does light bend going into and out of lenses?\" and the answer involves seeing light no longer as a particle but as a wave function (the quantum perspective), and then taking advantage of that wave function's tendency to prefer fastest-travel paths, and then noticing that the apparent bend is in fact the path of fastest travel.",

          "content_cn": "若有人好奇光线进入透镜时为何会弯曲：首先，光在某些材料中明显减速是因为光子不断与电子相互作用，这些相互作用产生的次级波与原光波存在轻微相位差，最终形成传播速度实际变慢的修正波。因此光线在空气中直线传播比穿过透镜更快。\n\n其次，从量子物理角度深入解释：光通常遵循两点间最短路径，因为该路径往往能在不同可能路线间产生最显著的相长干涉（其原理更为复杂，费曼的《QED：光和物质的奇妙理论》一书提供了很好的入门说明）。\n\n再者，设想救生员跑向海中救援时，他们会选择最快路径而非直冲溺水者——会在沙滩上多跑一段以减少游泳距离，因为水中行进速度更慢。最终形成分段线性路径：两条直线行程在水线处发生弯折。\n\n总结而言，若问“光线进出透镜时为何弯曲？”，答案在于不再将光视为粒子而视作波函数（量子视角），利用波函数倾向于最快传播路径的特性，并注意到这种表观弯曲实为最快传播路径。"

The sinusoid is a good illustration of what a given receiver might detect at some location (X,Y,Z). A more accurate way to show that may be a light source fading on and off to match some frequency (below THz). Then factoring in the speed of light, at time zero, the light will be off, at some arbitrary time 1, the light will be illuminated at 0.25 (scale goes up to 1 here). The light energy peak at time 1 is at the light. Then at time 2, the light goes up to 0.5. That means that the 0.25 light is now 1 unit away from the light while the 0.5 is at the light. Step to time 3 and the light goes up to 0.75, meaning 1 unit from the light, the light is at 0.5 and 2 units from the light, the light is dimmer at 0.25. This repeats with the light hitting 1.0 then falling back to 0.75, then 0.5, etc. The movement of light is key and I think that's what is often either misunderstood or just not considered enough.",

But of course, that only raises a further question: Why would every other country in the world agree to let America steal its own people's money and data, and block its domestic tech sector from making interoperable products that would prevent this theft?> Here's an anecdote that unravels this riddle: many years ago, in the years before Viktor Orban rose to power, I used to guest-lecture at a summer PhD program in political science at Budapest's Central European University. And one summer, after I'd lectured to my students about anticircumvention law, one of them approached me.> They had been the information minister of a Central American nation during the CAFTA negotiations, and one day, they'd received a phone-call from their trade negotiator, calling from the CAFTA bargaining table. The negotiator said, \"You know how you told me not to give the Americans anticircumvention under any circumstances? Well, they're saying that they won't take our coffee unless we give them anticircumvention. And I'm sorry, but we just can't lose the US coffee market. Our economy would collapse. So we're going to give them anticircumvention. I'm really sorry.\"> That's it. That's why every government in the world allowed US Big Tech companies to declare open season on their people's private data and ready cash.> The alternative was tariffs. Well, I don't know if you've heard, but we've got tariffs now!> I mean, if someone threatens to burn your house down unless you follow their orders, and then they burn your house down anyway, you don't have to keep following their orders.

It'll be increasingly difficult to choose a good cultural artefict for consumption (e.g., which book to read next or which movie to watch). A very good indicator for quality is time and thus a useful filter.In some years we could have the following: a netflix-like (legal variant of popcorntime) software system (p2p) that serves high-quality public domain movies, for those who like it, even with AI upscaling or post processing.The same would also work for books, with this pipeline: Project Gutenberg -> Standard Ebooks. At the inflection point, there would be a steady stream of high-quality formats of high-quality content, enough to satisfy the demand of cultural consumption.

I actually appreciate it when, e.g., a book is 1/2 the size and weight, and usually also made far more durably; but it will invariably compromise any author intention related to the arrangement of the lettering.Maybe you can confirm that based on what seems to be your English and German editions of the same novel.",

Sometimes the connection is a little fuzzy, but we do the best we can given that art must be pre-1930 and also must have been previously published.(My personal favorite artwork selection of the books I worked on is The Communist Manifesto[1]. That painting was actually made specifically for a different book by Willa Cather[2], but I thought the peasant laborer, holding a sickle in one hand, with a faraway look in her eyes as the red sun rises behind her was just too good to pass up for  Marx!)1920ish was when it started becoming much more common for books to have illustrated dust jackets, so now that more books from that era and onwards are entering the public domain, we opt to use the first edition dust jacket if it's in the appropriate style. Fortunately for us, that era also happens to be the so-called Golden Age of Illustration so it's not hard finding beautiful art to use![1] https://standardebooks.org/ebooks/karl-marx_friedrich-engels...[2] https://standardebooks.org/ebooks/willa-cather/the-song-of-t...",

For example, it:1. renders the cover as a JPG from the native SVG2. converts more complicated selectors (e.g. :nth-of-type, :empty, etc.) to classes and class selectors3. renders MathML as images4. renders SVGs as images…and a bunch more things to make it work better with older ereaders, which tend hang around for a long time.It’s worth pointing out that the Kobo builds are closer to the “advanced” build as they have great native support for MathML and SVG. But the build step adds in a bunch of Kobo-specific markup to make it work better there.In my experience, Apple Books does the best with the advanced builds, but it doesn’t support SVG covers so you end up with autogenerated ones, which seems a shame.

      "abstract": "该帖子核心讨论了Bundler能否达到uv（Python包管理器）的速度水平。社区普遍认同uv的缓存设计是其高效的关键，有人认为Bundler可通过类似架构改进（如全局缓存、优化依赖解析流程）来提升性能。讨论中提到，RubyGems.org已提供类似Python的包元数据接口，这有助于减少不必要的下载。也有用户指出，更根本的改进方向是为gem建立文件索引数据库，以避免每次require时的文件系统扫描。\n\n分歧点主要体现在技术路径上：部分用户强调应聚焦于算法和设计优化，而非盲目用Rust重写；另有用户坚持任何替代方案都必须支持“最小版本选择”功能。此外，对于性能感知存在差异——有用户认为Bundler速度尚可，但多数仍期待显著提升。整体上，社区对借鉴uv思路持开放态度，但具体实施方案仍有待探索。",

When a package says it requires python<4.0, uv ignores the upper bound and only checks the lower. This reduces resolver backtracking dramatically since upper bounds are almost always wrong.I don't think that ignoring upper bounds has a significant impact on uv's performance. We do this for a totally different reason, which is that it leads to better solves. For example, if you say your project requires Python 3.8 or later, but some dependency said it works for \">=3.8,<4\", then suddenly your project isn't installable on Python 4, and you'd be implicitly required to put a \"<4\" bound on your own project. uv solves for all of your supported Python versions, not a single version, so discounting the upper bounds doesn't actually save us any time in the solve.(See, e.g. https://discuss.python.org/t/requires-python-upper-limits/12....)",

          "content": "Really interesting post, but this part from the beginning stuck out to me:   Ruby Gems are tar files, and one of the files in the tar file is a YAML representation of the GemSpec. This YAML file declares all dependencies for the Gem, so RubyGems can know, without evaling anything, what dependencies it needs to install before it can install any particular Gem. Additionally, RubyGems.org provides an API for asking about dependency information, which is actually the normal way of getting dependency info (again, no eval required).\n\nIt would be interesting to compare and contrast the parsing speed for a large representative set of Python dependencies compared to a large representative set of Ruby dependencies. YAML is famously not the most efficient format to parse. We might have been better than `pip`, but I would be surprised if there isn't any room left on the table to parse dependency information in a more efficient format (JSON, protobufs, whatever).That said, the points at the end about not needing to parse gemspecs to install \"most\" dependencies would make this pretty moot (if the information is already returned from the gemserver)",

They don’t keysmash the numpad; they just hit 123456789 until the field is full!So not only does the song itself convey what some boss thinks is music, robotically beating at 123.45 bpm, but it is itself about being endlessly-rotating brainwashed-boring cogs in a pop music production industrial machine. I’m pretty sure the movie scene cuts and animations are timed specifically to the beats of the song, but knowing that they’re timed to a machine-specific bpm that a human would never select at random with a metronome?Absolute genius.I had no idea.

Along with counting traffic lights and crosswalks, one of those things is finding the exact BPM of a song. Not an estimate like most software does, but the exact value with extreme precision across the entire song.I thought BPM detection has been extremely precise for some time now (for electronic music anyway). Does this mean when software like Mixxx reports (for example) 125 BPM the raw output of the algorithm might have been 124.99, but some higher logic replaces it with an even 125?",

      "url": "https://enroll.sh",
      "content": "Happy new year folks!This tool was born out of a situation where I had 'inherited' a bunch of servers that were not under any form of config management. Oh, the horror...Enroll 'harvests' system information such as what packages are installed, what services are running, what files have 'differed' from their out-of-the-box defaults, and what other custom snowflake data might exist.The harvest state data can be kept as its own sort of SBOM, but also can be converted in a mere second or two into fully-functional Ansible roles/playbooks/inventory.It can be run remotely over SSH or locally on the machine. Debian and Redhat-like systems are supported.There is also a 'diff' mode to detect drift over time. (Years ago I used Puppet instead of Ansible and miss the agent/server model where it would check in and re-align to the expected state, in case people were being silly and side-stepping the config management altogether). For now, diff mode doesn't 'enforce' but is just capable of notification (webhook, email, stdout) if changes occur.Since making the tool, I've found that it's even useful for systems where you already have in Ansible, in that it can detect stuff you forgot to put into Ansible in the first place. I'm now starting to use it as a 'DR strategy' of sorts: still favoring my normal Ansible roles day-to-day (they are more bespoke and easier to read), but running enroll with '--dangerous --sops' in the background periodically as a 'dragnet' catch-all, just in case I ever need it.Bonus: it also can use my other tool JinjaTurtle, which converts native config files into Jinja2 templates / Ansible vars. That one too was born out of frustration, converting a massive TOML file into Ansible :)Anyway, hope it's useful to someone other than me! The website has some demos and more documentation. Have fun every(any)-one.",

      "content_cn": "新年快乐，朋友们！这个工具的诞生源于我“继承”了一堆没有任何配置管理的服务器时的窘境。哦，那真是场噩梦……Enroll工具能够“采集”系统信息，比如安装了哪些软件包、运行了哪些服务、哪些文件与其出厂默认设置相比发生了“变化”，以及可能存在哪些其他自定义的特殊数据。采集到的状态数据可以作为一种软件物料清单（SBOM）保存，同时也能在一两秒内转换为功能完整的Ansible角色、剧本和清单。它可以通过SSH远程运行，也可以在机器上本地执行。支持Debian和类Redhat系统。此外，还有一个“差异”模式，用于检测随时间发生的配置漂移。（多年前我使用Puppet而非Ansible，那时很怀念其代理/服务器模型，它能定期检查并重新对齐到预期状态，以防有人绕过配置管理随意操作。）目前，差异模式仅支持通知，并不具备“强制执行”功能……",
      "abstract": "该HackerNews帖子讨论了一款名为Enroll的工具，它能够将现有服务器配置反向工程转换为Ansible配置管理代码。核心话题是此工具如何帮助管理员自动化管理那些缺乏配置管理的历史遗留服务器。\n\n社区反应普遍积极。许多用户认为这是一个非常实用的工具，能显著减少手动配置迁移的工作量，尤其适用于接手旧系统或快速开始使用Ansible的场景。有用户指出，它解决了长期存在的痛点，甚至有人称之为“梦寐以求的工具”。讨论中提到，配套工具JinjaTurtle还能进一步将配置转换为Jinja2模板和Ansible变量。\n\n然而，也存在一些疑虑和分歧。主要争议点集中在工具的准确性和可靠性上。有用户询问其转换的精确度如何，以及是否经过充分测试，例如用生成的配置部署新机器能否完全复现原系统功能。也有用户指出，即使使用工具，使用者仍需具备足够知识来审查输出，识别不合理配置、动态内容或安全隐患。此外，有用户提出了对Windows和macOS平台类似工具的需求。\n\n共识在于，社区普遍认可该工具在特定使用场景下的价值，视其为快速捕获配置的实用方案，但同时也意识到自动化转换存在局限性，需要人工审查和干预。",

Like can I just run some bunch of commands to setup a server and then use this with ansible?Yes, exactly: let's say you provision a VPS and then install some stuff on it, configure some configs, create a crontab, create a user account. Running 'enroll harvest' on it will detect all of that, and 'enroll manifest' will then convert that 'harvest' into Ansible roles/playbooks.> Would this end up being a good use for it or would I just re-invent something similar to cloud-init on wrong abstraction. (On all fairness, one thing troubling me about cloud-init is that I would need to probably have a list of all commands that I want to run and all changes which sometimes if history command might have some issues or you do end up writing files etc. ends up being a little messy)Yeah, your instinct is right on the latter point. Ansible and Cloud-init are similar in that they are both 'declarative' systems to say what should exist on the machine. Ansible has some advantages in that it compares with the current setup to see if it needs to change anything. Cloud-init (in my experience) is a bit more crude: 'just run this stuff the first time the machine is booted'.I'm sure there are different ways of using it, but in my experience, cloud-init is really designed to 'run once' (first time setup). For example, if you provision a machine with Terraform or OpenTofu, and you pass in cloud-init, then later if you change the cloud-init data, it wants to destroy the machine and rebuild it (unless you configure it explicitly not to do that, by which you have to tell it to 'ignore' changes to the cloud-init).Whereas with Ansible, you're at least equipped with a solid foundation that you can extend over time - you'll no doubt eventually need to make changes to your server post the initial setup.If you're new to Ansible, Enroll will be a quick way to get up and running with working Ansible configuration and you can adapt it from there as you learn it.Admittedly, to satisfy a lot of corner cases (or support different Linux distros), the Ansible code that Enroll generates is a bit complex to read compared to a 'bespoke' home-grown playbook, on the other hand, it's perfectly correct code and you'd be immediately exposed to good practice syntax.Let me know if you get to try it!",

I've been 'harvesting' one Qube VM and then building another and running the manifest on the second machine. It's been working very well to align it with the first machine. Most of my testing has been visually watching the Ansible play install/configure things that I expect to see occur.Where it falls down:1) Systems that are so old, the packages that it detected as being installed, are no longer 'installable' on a new system (e.g the apt repositories no longer have those packages, they just did at the time of the original install)2) Packages that were installed not via an apt repo but, say, dpkg -i (of a .deb file). Slack Desktop is a good example. Obviously the deb is not in the harvest, so it fails there.So, there'll always be corner cases, but assuming everything that you have installed on the old/obscure machine is still something that can be installed via the usual methods, it should be okay. (If you are running a system that is so old, its packages are no longer available upstream, it's probably time to let it go! :) )You'll want to use --exclude-path to ignore some server-specific stuff, perhaps, such as static network configuration etc. And of course, you can also comment out whatever roles are superfluous, in the playbook, before running it.Always use --check with Ansible first just in case.",

          "content": "Thanks for the comment and questions! Very wise.Let me break it down as to what harvest does:1) Detects the OS and its package backend (e.g dpkg vs rpm etc)2) Detects what packages are installed3) For each package, it tries to detect files in /etc/ that have been modified from the default that get shipped with the package . It does't walk the whole filesystem, it looks straight in /etc for stuff here.4) It detects running/enabled services and timers via systemd. For each of these, it looks for the unit files, any 'drop-in' files, environment variable files, etc, as well as what executable it executes, and tries to map those systemd services to the packages it's already learned about earlier (that way, those 'packages' or future Ansible roles, can also be associated with 'handlers' in Ansible, to handle restart of the services if/when the configs change)5) Aside from known packages already learned, it optimistically tries to capture extra system configuration in /etc that is common for config management. This is stuff like crons, logrotate configs, networking settings (as you noted!), hosts files, etc.6) It also looks for other snowflake stuff in /etc not associated with packages/services or other typical system config, and will put these into an etc_custom role7) Likewise, it looks in /usr/local for stuff, on the assumption that this is an area that custom apps/configs might've been placed in. These go into a usr_local_custom role.8) It captures non-system user accounts, their group memberships and their .ssh/authorized_keys9) takes into account anything the user set with --exclude-path or --include-path . For anything extra that is included, it will put these into an 'extra_paths' role. The location could be anywhere e.g something in /opt, /srv/ whatever you want.10) writes the state.json and captures the artifactsSo yes, you're right - it does capture stuff that many people might want to exclude if they are going to use the manifests to build other machines from that harvest (as opposed to just rebuild the same machine itself).But you can use --exclude-path /etc/network and so on to skip the bits you don't want. You also can always comment out from the playbook.yml or delete certain roles it generates once you've run the 'enroll manifest'.It doesn't have any knowledge of Ansible Galaxy roles/modules etc. It generates all the roles itself. I admit, many of the existing roles out there are a lot more pleasant/easier to read (especially Jeff Geerling's). I still use those myself day to day. A lot of configs out there are also good candidates for being Jinja templates with abstracted vars for separate hosts. Enroll does use my companion tool JinjaTurtle if it's installed, but JinjaTurtle only recognises certain types of files (.ini style, .json, .xml, .yaml, .toml, but not special ones like Nginx or Apache conf files which have their own special syntax).I consider Enroll to be a good 'quick, grab it all, so I can sleep at night' method, perhaps best for DR purposes.In terms of safety measures: it doesn't traverse symlinks, and it has an 'IgnorePolicy' that makes it ignore most binary files (except GPG binary keys used with apt) - though if you specify certain paths with --include-path and use --dangerous, it will skip its own policy. See https://git.mig5.net/mig5/enroll/src/branch/main/enroll/igno... .It will skip files that are too large, and it also currently has a hardcoded cap of the number of files that it will harvest (4000 for /etc/ and /usr/local/etc and /usr/local/bin, and 500 per 'role'), to avoid 'bomb' situations.I think your caution is very warranted and wise, and I highly recommend to always use --check with Ansible when/if you get to applying the playbook!Thanks again.",

If the file is largish this introduces an annoying pause. Using -L skips all that.Ctrl-R as the first character of a search string will search for that literal string, not the regular expression.
