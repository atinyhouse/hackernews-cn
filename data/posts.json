      "abstract": "该讨论围绕苹果公司宣布将对iOS应用内的Patreon创作者收入抽取高达30%佣金的事件展开。核心争议在于苹果应用商店的高额抽成是否合理，以及开发者应如何应对。\n\n社区观点多元：有人认为苹果凭借垄断地位收取过高佣金，其应用商店运营利润率高达约78%，远超合理范围；也有用户指出开发者可通过内嵌浏览器窗口处理支付来规避抽成，但此举会增加操作门槛。讨论中提到，部分用户因此拒绝使用iOS设备，并批评科技巨头滥用市场主导地位。\n\n分歧明显：一方认为苹果的抽成政策过于贪婪，尤其在其硬件销售已获利丰厚的情况下；另一方则提及苹果曾因类似政策与Epic Games发生法律纠纷，质疑其合法性。普遍共识是，当前移动应用生态趋于封闭，开发者缺乏有效制衡手段，而平台抽成可能最终转嫁给消费者。",

Nobody other some CNBC guests really gets too upset when they take 30% from tinder, music or mobile gaming companies. And those types of apps run by unpopular large companies make up the majority of App Store revenue.However, newspapers and content creators are popular in a way that carries political weight. It'd be wise for Apple exempt these categories and write off the few hundred million in forgone revenue as a political expense.For example allowing the NYT or Joe Rogan to have nice paid apps with no fees would be a much more effective use of money than the same amount in political donations.",

It Is arguably even a faster process than going through the App Store, even if users may be more familiar with it.You could accompany it with some copy explaining how it keeps the service efficient and affordable, i.e., possible stating if you were to offer an app you would have to increase the price by 75% to pay Apple their fee and for the extra costs.I suspect other arguments for PWAs would not really matter, like that you have no need to track them or use other abilities an app affords, etc. Most people only care about very few things engineers actually care, let alone know about.I’ve always been an advocate of PWAs whenever it makes sense and will even design and architect to that objective. But even when I would deal with clients, I think the real “up hill battle” is that apps allow for higher fees and charges because they’re more work and come with greater expenses for for-profit apps, so there has been very little incentive to spread general user awareness about the “add to Home Screen”/PWA.It’s a bit of a paradox, but I guess that seems to be an under-appreciated driver in something like “advanced consumer capitalist economies”, where the “rational actor” simply does not exist anymore.",

If that driver would also have been driving a large SUV that child would have been pushed on the ground and ran over, so probably a fatality. And also functionally nobody would have given a shit apart from some lame finger pointing at (probably) the kid’s parents.And it is not the child’s or their parents’ fault either:Once you accept elementary school aged children exist, you have to accept they will sometimes run out like this. Children just don’t have the same impulse control as adults. And honestly even for adults stepping out a bit from behind an obstacle in the path of a car is an easy mistake to make. Don’t forget that for children an SUV is well above head height so it isn’t even possible for them to totally avoid stepping out a bit before looking. (And I don’t think stepping out vs. running out changes the outcome a lot)This is why low speed limits around schools exist.So I would say the Waymo did pretty well here, it travelled at a speed where it was still able to avoid not only a fatality but also major injury.",

US human drivers cause ~7,000 child pedestrian injurys per year [2]. That amounts to a average of 1 child pedestrian injury per ~470 million miles. Waymo has done ~100-200 million fully autonomous miles [3][4]. That means they average 1 child pedestrian injury per ~100-200 million miles. That is a injury rate ~2-4x higher than the human average.However, the child pedestrian injury rate is only a official estimate (possible undercounting relative to highly scrutinized Waymo miles) and is a whole US average (operational domain might not be comparable, though this could easily swing either way), but absent more precise and better information, we should default to the calculated 2-4x higher injury rate; it is up to Waymo to robustly demonstrate otherwise.Furthermore, Waymo has published reasonably robust claims arguing they achieve ~90% crash reduction [5] in total. The most likely new hypotheses in light of this crash are:A. Their systems are not actually robustly 10x better than human drivers. Waymos claims are incorrect or non-comparable.B. There are child-specific risk factors that humans account for that Waymo does not that cause a 20-40x differential risk around children relative to normal Waymo driving.C. This is a fluke child pedestrian injury. Time will tell.

(I'm not defending their performance... just their response to the collision). This test / protocol is hard for any driver (including human driven vehicles), let alone ADAS/L3/L4 vehicles, for various reasons, including: pedestrian occlusion, late ped detection, late braking, slick roads, not enough braking, etc. etc.Having said all that, full collision avoidance would have been best outcome, which, in this case, it wasn't.  Wherever the legal fault may lie -- and there will be big debate here -- Waymo will still have to accept some responsibility, given how aggressively they are rolling out their commercial services.This only puts more onus on their team to demonstrate a far higher standard of driving than human drivers.

(yes, those are my qualifiers...)Here's their main stash [1] but notably, three papers talk about comparison of Waymo's rider-only (i.e. no safety driver) performance vis-a-vis human driver, at 7.1 million miles [2], 25 million miles [3], 56 million miles [4]. Waymo has also been a big contributor to various AV safety standards as one would expect (FWIW, I was also a contributor to 3 of the standards... the process is sausage-making at its finest, tbh).I haven't read thru all their papers, but some notable ones talk about the difficulty of comparing AV vs human drivers [5], and various research on characterising uncertainty / risk of collision, comparing AVs to non-impaired, eyes-on human driver [6]As one may expect, at least one of the challenges is that human-driven collisions are almost always very _lagging indicators_ of safety (i.e. collision happened: lost property, lost limbs, lost lives, etc.)So, net-net, Waymo still has a VERY LONG WAY to go (obviously) to demonstrate better than human driving behavior, but they are showing that their AVs are better-than-humans on certain high-risk (potential) collisions.As somebody remarked, the last 1% takes 90% of time/effort. That's where we are...---[1] https://waymo.com/safety/research[2] https://waymo.com/research/comparison-of-waymo-rider-only-cr...[3] https://waymo.com/research/do-autonomous-vehicles-outperform...[4] https://waymo.com/research/comparison-of-waymo-rider-only-cr...[5] https://waymo.com/research/comparative-safety-performance-of...[6] https://waymo.com/blog/2022/09/benchmarking-av-safety/[edit: reference]",

          "content": "> But is 17mph a safe speed at an active school dropoff area?Now you're asking interesting questions... Technically, in CA, the speed limit in school zones are 25 mph (which local authorities can change to 15 mph, as needed). In this case, that would be something the investigation would check, of course. But regardless of that, 17 mph per se is not a very fast speed (my gut check: turning around intersections at > 10-11 mph feels fast, but going straight at 15-20 mph doesnt feel fast; YMMV). But more generally, in the presence of child VRUs (vulnerable road users), it is prudent to drive slowly just because of the randomness factor (children being the most unaware of critters). Did the Waymo see the kids around in the area? If so, how many and where? and how/where were they running/moving to? All of that is investigation data...My 2c is that Waymo already took all of that into account and concluded that 17 mph was indeed a good speed to move at......which leads to your observation below:> (My general impression observing Waymo vehicles is that they’ve gone from being obnoxiously cautious to often rather aggressive.)Yes, I have indeed made that same observation. The Waymos of 2 years ago were very cautious; now they seem much more assertive, even a bit aggressive (though that would be tough to define). That is a driving policy decision (cautious vs assertive vs aggressive).One could argue if indeed 17 mph was the \"right\" decision. My gut feel is Waymo will argue that (but likely they might make the driving policy more cautious esp in presence of VRUs, and child VRUs particularly)",

I had to ABS brake to avoid an accident.Most human drivers (not all) know to nose out carefully rather than to gun it in that situation.So, while I'm very supportive of where Waymo is trying to go for transport, we should be constructively critical and not just assume that humans would have been in the same situation if driving defensively.",

They all add to make driving harder and feel more dangerous in order to force attention and lower speed.One is to merge opposite directional roads into a single lane, forcing drivers to cooperate and take turn to pass it, one car at a time.For a combined car and pedestrian road (max speed of 7km/h) near where I live, they intentionally added large obfuscating objects on the road that limited visibility and harder to navigate. This forces drivers to drive very slow, even when alone on the road, as they can't see if a car or person may be behind the next object.In an other road they added several tight S curves in a row, where if you drive anything faster than 20km/h you will fail the turns and drive onto the artificial constructed curbs.In other roads they put a sign in the middle of two way roads while at the same time drastically limiting the width to the curb, forcing drivers to slow down in order to center the car in the lane and squeeze through.In each of those is that a human driver with human fear of crashing will cause drivers to pay extra attention and slow down.",

Parents may enable this, but ultimately if one’s child does something stupid contrary to one’s guidance and restrictions, they may end up with a Darwin for it. Two hundred years ago the child mortality rate was half, as in you lost one child per two, and most of those were not the fault of the child or parents. Society for quite some years has been pushing that down, to the point that a near-death involving a neglectful parent and a witless child is apparently (?) newsworthy — but the number of deaths will never reach zero, whether humans or robots or empty plains and blue skies. There will always be a Veruca Salt throwing themselves into the furnace no matter how many safety processes we impose onto roads, cars, drivers, and/or robots.If you want to see an end to this nonsensical behavior by parents, pressure your local city into having strict traffic enforcement and ticketing during school hours at every local school, so that the parent networks can’t share news with each other of which school is being ‘harassed’ today. Give license points to vehicles that drop a child across the street, issue parking tickets to double parkers, and boot vehicles whose drivers refuse to move when asked. Demand they do this for the children, to protect them from the robots, if you like.But.It’ll protect them much more from the humans than from the robots, and after a few thousand rockets are issued to parents behaving badly, you’ll find that the true threat to children’s safety on school roads is children’s parents — just as the schools have known for decades. And that’s not a war you’ll win arguing against robots. (It’s a war you’ll win arguing against child-killing urban roadway design, though!)",

Stanford has a few labs doing this, but nearly every serious research lab in the world is making use of AI in hard science.

Data entry (for things that aren't actually all that critical), save a little money (maybe), put someone who was already probably poor out of work! LFG!4. Give into the laziest aspects of yourself and convince yourself you're saving time by having them writing text (code, emails ect) and ignoring how many future headaches you're actually causing for yourself. This applies to most shortcuts in life, I don't know why people think that it doesn't apply here.I'm sure there are some other productive and genuinely useful use cases like translation or helping the disabled, but that is .00001% of tokens being produced.I really really really can't wait for this these \"applications\" to go the way of NFT companies.

I'll just cite the part I remembered looking at this (copypasted from the actual book):He turned to Powell. “What are we going to do now?”Powell felt tired, but uplifted. “Nothing. He’s just shown he can run the station perfectly. I’ve never seen an electron storm handled so well.”“But nothing’s solved. You heard what he said of the Master. We can’t—”“Look, Mike, he follows the instructions of the Master by means of dials, instruments, and graphs. That’s all we ever followed. As a matter of fact, it accounts for his refusal to obey us. Obedience is the Second Law. No harm to humans is the first. How can he keep humans from harm, whether he\nknows it or not? Why, by keeping the energy beam stable. He knows he can keep it more stable than we can, since he insists he’s the superior being, so he must keep us out of the control room. It’s inevitable if you consider the\nLaws of Robotics.”“Sure, but that’s not the point. We can’t let him continue this nitwit stuff about the Master.”“Why not?”“Because whoever heard of such a damned thing?

It simplifies life for the maintainers of Linux distributions, those who manage Linux systems, the end user, and software developers. Making a package manager a retail product store would complicate things for everyone.That said, the only thing preventing the distribution of proprietary software by most Linux distributions is policy. If a distribution wanted to do so, and the vendor's license allowed for permissive software distribution, they could do so. The vendor could implement their own mechanism for selling and distributing license keys. The advantage to them would be using a common software distribution method without having a middleman taking a cut. (Think shareware, or even physical software that included a license key.)",

Maybe they will. It would be nice to see. It's interesting seeing so many comments assume the worst of them, as someone who has played around with that Python API a little bit.

Hospitals, schools, water treatment facilities, roads for their own use may merit issuing bonds that can be paid off based on new or existing taxes.

This vacuum of power has allowed the new landlords in power to swoop in and play city governments against each other with impunity.The negotiating power of these states is so poor that they present an opportunity for the Metas of the world to make them even worse while becoming the new \"benevolent\" landlords. There doesn't need to be an NDA and secrecy, and in theory the city could get a good deal out of it, but realistically their utilities will just be abused because the words \"civil rights\" and \"justice\" have exited the lexicon.",

They also needed cheap power. This means there’s only a few ideal locations in the US: places like Virginia, Oregon, Ohio, Dallas, Kansas City, Denver, SF are all big fiber hubs. Oregon for example also has cheap power and water.Then you have the compounding effect where as you expand your data centers, you want them near your already existing data centers for inter-DC latency reasons. AWS can’t expand us-east-1 capacity by building a data center in Oklahoma because it breaks things like inter-DC replication.Enter LLMs: massive need for expanded compute capacity, but latency and failover connectivity doesn’t really matter (the extra latency from sending a prompt to compute far away is dwarfed by the inference time, and latency for training matters even less).

That deal ultimately fell through amid opposition by Salt Lake County Mayor Ben McAdams and a vote of conditional support by the Utah Board of Education that sought to cap the company’s tax benefits.> That project went to New Mexico, which was offering even richer incentives.> Three months after the Utah negotiations ended, state lawmakers voted in a special session to approve a sales tax exemption for data centers. The move was seen by many as another attempt to woo Facebook to the Beehive State.So basically they first said \"No\", lost the bid, had FOMO so they passed new laws to attract this business.>Asked about the identity of the company, Foxley said only that it is “a major technology company that wants to bring a data center to Utah.”>And that vision could soon be a reality, after members of the Utah County Commission voted Tuesday to approve roughly $150 million in property tax incentives to lure an as-yet-unnamed company — that sounds an awful lot like Facebook — to the southern end of Pony Express Parkway.Seems like a pretty open and obvious secret.",

With an LSP syntax errors are a solved problem, if the language is statically typed I often find myself just checking out type signatures of library methods, simpler to me than asking an LLM. But I would love to have LLMs fixing your syntax and with types available or not, giving suggestions on how to best use the libraries given current context.Cursor tab does that to some extent but it's not fool proof and it still feels too \"statistical\".I'd love to have something deeply integrated with LSPs and IDE features, for example VSCode alone has the ability of suggesting imports, Cursor tries to complete them statistically but it often suggest the wrong import path. I'd like to have the twos working together.Another example is renaming identifiers with F2, it is reliable and predictable, can't say the same when asking an agent doing that. On the other hand if the pattern isn't predictable, e.g. a migration where a 1 to 1 rename isn't enough, but needs to find a pattern, LLMs are just great.

This really helps me retain my skills, though there is some \"skew\" (I'm not sure how to describe it, it's a feeling). Making instructions to LLMs to me is pretty similar to doing the basic software architecture and specification work that a lot of people tend to skip (now, there's not choice and it's directly useful). When you skip specification for a sufficiently complex project, you likely introduce footguns along the way that slows down development significantly. So what would one expect when they run a bunch of agents based on a single sentence prompt?!Like the architecture work and making good quality specs, working on code has a guiding effect on the coding agents. So in a way, it also benefits to clarify items that may be more ambiguous in the spec. If I write some of the code myself, it will make fewer assumptions about my intent when it touches it (especially when I didn't specify them in the architecture or if they are difficult to articulate in natural language).In small iterations, the agent checks back for each task. Because I spend a lot of time on architecture, I already have a model in my mind of how small code snippets and feature will connect.Maybe my comfort with reviewing AI code comes form spending a large chunk of my life reverse engineering human code, to understand it to the extent that complex bugs and vulnerabilities emerge. I've spent a lot of time with different styles of code writing from awful to \"this programmer must have a permanent line to god to do this so elegantly\".

We conduct randomized experiments to study how developers gained mastery of a new asynchronous programming library with and without the assistance of AI. We find that AI use impairs conceptual understanding, code reading, and debugging abilities, without delivering significant efficiency gains on average. Participants who fully delegated coding tasks showed some productivity improvements, but at the cost of learning the library. We identify six distinct AI interaction patterns, three of which involve cognitive engagement and preserve learning outcomes even when participants receive AI assistance.

And I've lost maybe a day of work because of connectivity issues. I've been deep in a rainforest during a monsoon and still had 4g connection.If Anthropic goes down I can switch to Gemini. If I run out of credits (people use credits? I only use a monthly subscription) then I can find enough free credits around to get some basic work done. Increasingly, I could run a local model that would be good enough for some things and that'll become even better in the future. So no, I don't think these are any kind of valid arguments. Everyone relies on online services for their work these days, for banking, messaging, office work, etc. If there's some kind of catastrophe that breaks this, we're all screwed, not just the coders who rely on LLMs.",

I just woke up, made a cup of coffee, read the financial news, and started exploring the code I wrote yesterday.My first thought was that I can abstract what I wrote yesterday, which was a variation of what I built over the previous week. My second thought was a physiological response of fear that today is going to be a hard hyper focus day full of frustration, and that the coding agents that built this will not be able to build a modular, clean abstraction. That was followed by weighing whether it is better to have multiple one off solutions, or to manually create the abstraction myself.I agree with you 100 percent that the poor performance of models like GPT 4 introduced some kind of regularization in the human in loop coding process.Nonetheless, we live in a world of competition, and the people who develop techniques that give them an edge will succeed. There is a video about the evolution of technique in the high jump, the Western Roll, the Straddle Technique, and finally the Fosbury Flop. Using coding agents will be like this too.I am working with 150 GB of time series data. There are certain pain points that need to be mitigated. For example, a different LLM model has to be coerced into analyzing or working with the data from a completely different approach in order to validate. That means instead of being 4x faster, each iteration is 4x faster, and it needs to be done twice, so it still is only 2x faster. I burned $400 in tokens in January. This cannot be good for the environment.Timezone handling always has to be validated manually. Every exploration of the data is a train and test split. Here is the thing that hurts the most. The AI coding agents always show the top test results, not the test results of the top train results. Rather than tell me a model has no significant results, it will hide that and only present the winning outliers, which is misleading and, like the OP research suggests, very dangerous.A lot of people are going to get burned before the techniques to mitigate this are developed.Overfitting has always been a problem when working with data. Just because the barrier of entry for time series work is much lower does not mean that people developing the skill, whether using old school tools like ARIMA manually or having AI do the work, escape the problem of overfitting. The models will always show the happy, successful looking results.Just like calculators are used when teaching higher math at the secondary level so basic arithmetic does not slow the process of learning math skills, AI will be used in teaching too. What we are doing is confusing techniques that have not been developed yet with not being able to acquire skills. I wrack and challenge my brain every day solving these problems. As millions of other software engineers do as well, the patterns will emerge and later become the skills taught in schools.",

If all your email is that account and not your main one, then when it responds, it will come from a random @gmail. It's also a pain to find a way to move ALL old emails over to that Gmail for all the old stuff.I think we need an OpenClaw security tips-and-tricks site where all this advice is collected in one place to help people protect themselves.

Even if an LLM has 200K or 1M context, I always notice degradation after 100K. Putting in a heavy chunk for memory will make the agent worse at simple tasks.One thing I did learn was that OpenClaw uses Pi under the hood.

We will no longer have UIs there you have dozens or hundreds of buttons as the norm, instead you will talk to an LLM/agent that will trigger the workflows you need through natural language. AI will eat UI.Of course, OpenClaw/Moltbot/Clawdbot has lots of security issues. That's not really their fault, the industry has not yet reached consensus on how to fix these issues. But OpenClaw's rapid rise to popularity (fastest growing GH repo by star count ever) shows how people want that future to come ASAP. The security problems do need to be solved. And I believe they will be, soon.I think the demand comes also from the people wanting an open agent. We don't want the agentic future to be mainly closed behind big tech ecosystems.

In the second case, an automated test harness might fail, but in the real world the user will just wait and retry when the server is under less load. Maybe you don't include that because it's actually misleading to say that performance (in terms of the model's intelligence, which is how the benchmark will be interpreted) is worse.",

But the PS2 hardware is getting a bit long in the toothBesides the library, the PS2 is the most successful video game console of all time in terms of number of units shipped, and it stayed on the market for over ten years, featured a DVD drive, and at one point was positioned by Sony not just as an entertainment appliance but as a personal computer, including their own official PS2 Linux distribution.In a more perfect world, this would have:(a) happened with a hypothetical hardware platform released after the PS2 but before the PS3, with specs lying in between the two: a smidge better than the former, but not quite as exotic as the latter (with its Cell CPU or the weird form factor; whereas the PS2's physical profile in comparison was perfect, whether in the original form or the Slim version), which could have:(b) resulted in a sort of standardization in the industry like what happened to the IBM PC and its market of clones, with other vendors continuing to manufacture semi-compatible units even if/when Sony discontinued it themselves, periodically revving the platform (doubling the amount of memory here, providing a way to tap into higher clock speeds there) all while maintaining backwards compatibility such that you would be able to go out today and buy a brand new, $30 bargain-bin, commodity \"PS2 clone\" that can do basic computing tasks on it (in other words, not including the ability to run a modern Web browser or Electron apps), can play physical media, and supports all the original games and any other new games that explicitly target(ed) the same platform, or you could pay Steam Machine 2026 prices for the latest-gen \"PS2\" that retains native support for the original titles of the very first platform revision but unlocks also the ability to play those for every intermediate rev, too.",

You can make an equally strong case that the Super Famicom is the best console of all time, with dozens of 10/10 games that stand the test of time. I think the limitations of the hardware played a pivotal role in both, as they demanded good stylistic decisions to create aesthetically appealing games with limited resources, and demanded a significant level of work into curating and optimizing the game design, because every aspect of the game consumed limited resources and therefore bad ideas had to be culled, leaving a well-polished remainder of the best ideas in a sort of Darwinian sense.> (b) resulted in a sort of standardization in the industry like what happened to the IBM PC and its market of clones, with other vendors continuing to manufacture semi-compatible unitsUnlike the PC market, the comprehensive list of \"other vendors\" is two entries long.

Powerful. Complicated to use. But, not complicated to specify.This is made much simpler by the fact that the only documentation Sony provided was written by the Japanese hardware engineers. It laid out the bit-by-bit details of the instruction set. And, the bitwise inputs, outputs, delays and side effects of each instruction.No guidance on how to use it. But, awesome docs for writing a simulator (or recompiler).",

          "content": "Lol yep. Emacs as the IDE, Allegro Common Lisp as the interpreter + HAL implementation, and GOAL itself being a Scheme-like.Naughty Dog in general was actually a primarily Lisp studio for a long time. It was only in the PS3 era with Uncharted and The Last of Us that they switched to C++ because trying to maximise the performance out of a Lisp interpreter environment with the complexity the Cell Processors added on a time and cash budget simply wasn't feasible for them.The Crash Bandicoot games were written in GOOL (Game Oriented Object Lisp) which they wrote prior to GOAL and the Jak and Daxter games. GOOL/Lisp of course was extremely important for the Crash Bandicoot legacy because by writing their own higher level interpreter they were given an excuse to through away the entire standard library that Sony gave them and start from scratch. That process allowed them to write a massively more performant stdlib and execution environment leading to Crash Bandicoot being able to support game environments an order of magnitude more complex than other games at the time could. And of course this allowed them to build in a system for lazy loading the environment as the player progressed through the levels which firmly cemented Naughty Dog in the video games history books.Andy Gavin actually has an incredible blog site (including a 13 part series on Crash Bandicoot and a 5 part series on Jak and Daxter) that has over the decades documented the history of their studio's game development process and all the crazy things they did to make their games work on hardware where it really shouldn't have been able to with the tools they were provided.https://all-things-andy-gavin.com/video-games-archive/",

One example is the graphics due to the unusual architecture of the Emotion Engine (gpu). I think this forced the developers to consider what their games really required and where they wanted to spend the development effort, one of the key ingredients for good game design.Additionally the release hype of the PS2 was quite big and the graphics that where achievable where very good at the time, so developers wanted to go through the development pains to create a game for this console.Not to forget besides the mountain of great titles for the PS2 there is also a mountain of flopped games that faded into obscurity.",

They aren't decompiling it to c++ that looks like original source code, it more like they're converting it to c++ that emulates the processor and gets statically compiled.So it's not really just a drop and go replacement like it sounds like it'd be, but it has so far enabled the recompilation of multiple n64 games.

This “Microsoft just did X” is another entry in that.Folks, let’s not beat around the bush: if you’re not your own boss, you don’t have agency and ultimately you have no control over the situation. The frustration is rooted in the lack of control, or at the very least in the lack of perception of cooperation that is a temporary substitute for agency and control (until the rug gets pulled from underneath them). It’s not Microsoft, it’s not Teams, it’s not AI. It’s not the person being promoted for doing this. It’s you. If it was your company, you could have put an end to it and changed the processes immediately. But it isn’t. So for having the privilege of working at whatever company you’re at, and getting paid whatever money you’re paid, you have to eat shit. This is the price you pay.If you don’t want to eat shit from your bosses, you have to be your own boss.

Various outlets have been running stories for almost a year now about how Teams is going to start sending your WiFi data to your boss.The wording on the product page also makes it sound like tenant administrators will get to decide how opt-in works (ie - that they could select which options the end-user is allowed to pick, and at Microsoft they happened to give you the freedom of choice); this makes sense from my experience in enterprise software management but also makes the feature seem like it will be incredibly yucky/annoying.

There are always manager types who have the epiphany that not everyone is working 100% of the time and it bothers them enough to call it out to subordinates, or if they don't like someone enough they might do a deep dive with IT.

I'm not even sure how else to make this really work right.If it really is SSID based, the feature would be relatively useless for most organizations even before discussion trying to spoof it. E.g. the last place I worked had ~3,500 physical addresses with APs (and many more individual buildings/\"office\" names), all with the same \"Corp_Name_Employee\" SSID because otherwise it's way more work to have unique SSIDs.

          "content": "Now I can't stop thinking about _The Experience Machine_ by Andy Clark. It theorizes that this is how humans navigate and experience the real world: Our brains generate what we think the world around is like and our senses don't so much directly process visual information but instead act like a kind of loss function for our internal simulations. Then we use that error to update our internal model of the world.In this view, we are essentially living inside a high-fidelity generative model. Our brains are constantly 'hallucinating' a predicted reality based on past experience and current goals. The data from our senses isn't the source of the image; it's the error signal used to calibrate that internal model. Much like Genie 3 uses latent actions and frames to predict the next state of a world, our brains use 'Active Inference' to minimize the gap between what we expect and what we experience.It suggests that our sense of 'reality' isn't a direct recording of the world, but a highly optimized, interactive simulation that is continuously 'regularized' by the photons hitting our retinas.",

It replicates some of the macro structure of the world but the true information content is low.Search YouTube for procedural landscape examples. Some of them are actually a lot more visually impressive than this, but without the interactivity. It's a popular topic in the demo scene too where people have made tiny demos (e.g. under 1k in size) that generate impressive scenes.I expect to see generative AI techniques like this show up in games, though it might take a bit due to their high computational cost compared to traditional procedural generation.",

I expect the public release uses a cheaper step-distilled / quantized version. The limitations seen in Genie 3 (high control latency, gradual loss of detail and drift towards videogamey behavior, 60s max rollout length) are still present. The editing/sharing tools, latency, cost, etc. can probably improve over time with this same model checkpoint, but new features like audio input/output, higher resolution, precise controls, etc. likely won't happen until the next major version.From a product perspective, I still don't have a good sense of what the market for WMs will look like. There's a tension between serious commercial applications (robotics, VFX, gamedev, etc. where you want way, way higher fidelity and very precise controllability), vs current short-form-demos-for-consumer-entertainment application (where you want the inference to be cheap-enough-to-be-ad-supported and simple/intuitive to use). Framing Genie as a \"prototype\" inside their most expensive AI plan makes a lot of sense while GDM figures out how to target the product commercially.On a personal level, since I'm also working on world models (albeit very small local ones https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43798757), my main thought is \"oh boy, lots of work to do\".

          "content": ">demand is still there todayNot all demand the same. There are broadly 2 types of USD buyers1. price insensitive: sovereign banks, who buys for liquidity/storage2. price sensitive: hedge funds, private buyer who buys returnsType 1 buyers are bailing out of treasury. Type 1 are marginal buyers, the close auction regardless or rate, this keeps rates low -> debt servicing low. They artificially depress yield to non market rates, without them rate go up because you have more price sensitive buyers who buy for returns. This increases borrowing costs, hence US debt repayment rising massively.Type 1 buyers, i.e. US allies (and historically even adversaries) soaked up treasuries are now de-dollarizing / buying gold in lieu of _more_ USD. Type 1s underpin the \"privilege\" part of exorbitant privilege. The more they de-dollarize the more dollars become exorbitant, aka debt like everyone else. Type1, sovereign held 60% of USD to 40% in last 5 years. This large part of why interest tripled and debt servicing went from 350B to 1T in 5 years. Type1s exit to 20% in another 5 years and maybe interest goes to 5%, debt servicing 2T+. It's the difference between 10%/20%/30% debt servicing as % of federal revenue.This not to mention USD reserve ticking down at 1% per year means meaningful changes in our lifetimes, and velocity may increase with developments like Saudi no longer locking oil to dollar. Less USD as % of global reserve = more network effects of alternate payment = increased potential velocity of USD reserve drop. This doesn't mean other currencies pickup all slack, i.e. central banks seem to be going in gold / commodities with no counter party risk for new storage. The net result is USD will still be around, in large volumes, but the cost/debt to sustain the system will be \"normalized\" while US budget is historically is built around USD debt being privileged. AKA difference between borrowing money from family vs payday loans.>Nearly all commodities are still priced in USDPRICED as in benchmarked in USD, but =/= USD is being spent to settle them. There's a fuckload of commodities where PRC alone buys 30/40/50%+ of global production, and while quoted in USD, increasingly settled in rmb/CIPS, bilateral currencies, BRI infra or other swaps mechanisms that bypasses USD. This one of the largest source of dedollarization - PRC went from single digit % to plurality of cross-border settlements in RMB/non USD. Though this is just very recent leading indicator that USD is functionally circumventable.",

          "content": "Full paper:https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-026-68303-9I was curious what the implementation looked like:> In the short-term intervention study, participants assigned to the oat group (OG) consumed three oat meals daily for two days instead of their habitual Western diet. Each oat meal comprised 100 × g of rolled oat flakes (Demeterhof Schwab GmbH & Co. KG, Windsbach, Germany) boiled in water. To ascertain potential long-term effects, the two-day intervention period was followed by a six-week follow-up period during which the participants returned to their habitual diet without oats. Subjects assigned to the control group (CG) consumed three standardized control meals without oats on each intervention day, which were macronutrient-adapted to the OG, instead of their habitual Western diet.> In the six-week intervention study, participants in the oat group (OG6w) replaced one habitual meal per day with an oatmeal comprising 80 × g of rolled oat flakes (Demeterhof Schwab GmbH & Co. KG), while maintaining their habitual Western diet. Participants in the corresponding control group (CG6w) maintained their habitual Western diet and remained abstinent from oats during the six-week study period according to the inclusion criteria.This is pretty remarkable:> Since cholesterol levels tended to remain below baseline during the six-week, oat-free follow-up period, persistent effects on lipid metabolism might be assumed (Fig. 3d). This assumption is further supported by the high compliance observed during the follow-up period, as all participants abstained from oat consumption and returned to their habitual Western diet, with no significant differences compared to their pre-study dietary patterns (Supplementary Data 2). Thus, our results indicate clearly that a high-dose oat diet improves lipid metabolism by decreasing serum TC and LDL-C levels, even after two days, which is consistent with the known cholesterol-lowering effect of oats. In addition, beneficial effects on anthropometrics and glucose metabolism were observed within each diet group (Supplementary Data 2), which we attribute to the diet-related calorie restriction.I gotta say though, 100 grams of oats (three times a day) is a lot. That's over a cup (dry). A typical serving is less than half that (40 grams dry).",

The new finding here is insight into the exact mechanism- a short-term, high-dose oatmeal diet (300g/day for two days) had significantly greater LDL-lowering effect than a medium-term, moderate-dose oatmeal diet (80g/day for six weeks), and they associated the difference with increases in several plasma phenolic compounds triggered by specific changes in the gut microbiome.",

Oatmeal (and other soluble fibers like psyllium husk) capture this bile and it is excreted in stool.3. In order to create the bile, the liver needs LDL. Because the LDL it used to create the bile was lost when it was captured, it exposes more LDL receptors and pulls LDL out of the bloodstream, thereby lowering LDL levels.It seems to me that in order to maximize the effectiveness of this LDL-lowering approach, one must not simply consume psyllium or oatmeal, but rather consume them in conjunction with fat. Not saturated fat, obviously, which raises LDL, but perhaps unsaturated or polyunsaturated fats. My expectation is that this would trigger the bile secretion required in order to actually sequester it.",

      "abstract": "该讨论围绕特斯拉自动驾驶汽车保险展开。核心话题是自动驾驶技术对保险模式的影响及FSD（完全自动驾驶）的实际安全性质疑。\n\n社区观点多元：有用户对特斯拉的安全数据持怀疑态度，认为其宣传可能缺乏独立性；也有用户分享亲身经历，表示FSD成功避免事故，相信机器驾驶优于人类。部分用户认为保险创新可能只是营销噱头，甚至猜测特斯拉在暗中补贴保险商以转移风险。\n\n主要争议点集中在责任归属与付费逻辑：一方认为自动驾驶普及后用户不应承担保险责任，因为车辆控制权已转移；另一方则关注使用数据（如关闭FSD时超速）是否会导致保费上涨。讨论中提到，若FSD订阅能显著降低保费，用户可能改变购买意愿。\n\n共识在于，此类保险实验有望推动事故数据的透明化，但对其商业模式的可持续性和责任划分仍存在显著分歧。",

This matters because people are much more likely to use FSD in situations where driving is easier. So, if the reduction is just during those times, I'm not even sure that would be better than a human driver.As an example, let's say most people use FSD on straight US Interstate driving, which is very easy. That could artificially make FSD seem safer than it really is.My prior on this is supervised FSD ought to be safer, so the 52% number kind of surprised me, however it's computed. I would have expected more like a 90-95% reduction in accidents.",

The topic comes up now and then around Tesla's, and impossible decisions that FSD will have to make.So at a certain point, and it may be right around the point of serious physical harm, the design decision to have or not have human-in-the-middle accountability seems to run into ethical constraints. In reality it's the ruthless bottom line focused corps - that don't seem to be the norm, but may have an outsized impact - that actually push up against ethical constraints. But even then, I would be wary as an executive documenting a decision to disregard potential harms at one of them shops.

It took nearly a year from OpenAI releasing GPT-4 to us having some form of access to this model for general work (coding and otherwise) internally, and from what I understand[0], it's just how long it took for the company to evaluate risks and iron out appropriate contractual agreements with Microsoft wrt. using generative models hosted on Azure.

In 2016, you could get a DDR4-2400 16GB kit for $81 [1], and a comparable G.SKILL Ripjaws V kit was around $52 [2]. Today (January 2026), that same G.SKILL kit costs $105-146 [3], and most 16GB DDR4 kits are running $95-150 [4]. So RAM is actually more expensive now than it was 10 years ago, not cheaper.The \"did we have X 10 years ago\" argument also misses a a lot of modern software requirements. Yes, we had mid-range laptops and budget gaming PCs in 2016, but the memory footprint of everyday applications has exploded since then. Electron-based apps (Slack, Teams, VS Code, Discord) routinely consume 500MB-1GB+ each [5], and it's entirely normal to have multiple running simultaneously. A typical \"light\" workload in 2026 easily uses 2-3x the RAM that a comparable workflow needed in 2016.So we're getting squeezed from both sides: applications demand more memory whilst memory itself costs more. An 8GB laptop was perfectly serviceable for office work in 2016; in 2026, it's borderline unusable with a few Chrome tabs and Teams open. The same kit that cost $55 in June 2025 now costs $150 [2, again]. That's a 150%+ increase in six months, pushing capable systems out of reach for budget-conscious users precisely when software bloat is making RAM more essential than ever.[1] https://gamersnexus.net/industry/3212-ram-price-investigatio...  \n[2] https://gamersnexus.net/news/ram-wtf  \n[3] https://www.newegg.com/p/pl?d=ddr4+ram+8gb  \n[4] https://pcpartpicker.com/trends/price/memory/  \n[5] https://josephg.com/blog/electron-is-flash-for-the-desktop/",

The last time they did that, in the crypto boom, the boom quickly turned into a bust and the memory makers got burned with a bad case of oversupply for years. With that context, can you blame them for wanting to go a bit more slowly with this boom?Sure, the new fabs won't be up and at volume production until late 2027 / early 2028, but committing tens of billions of dollars to new production facilities, including to facilities dedicated to DRAM rather than NAND or HBM, is hardly 'abandoning'. They're pivoting to higher profit margin segments - rational behavior for a for-profit corporation - but thanks to the invisible hand of the (not quite as free as it should be) market, this is, partially, a self-solving issue, as DRAM margins soar while HBM margins compress, and we're already seeing industry response to that dynamic, too: https://www.guru3d.com/story/samsung-reallocates-of-hbm3-cap...",

Although after the 3 months, I have to pay more around ~5-6$ per month but its still a recurring deal so I guess I might as well continue it (given I have setten everything up)Some of it is definitely lose making as well to lock in. I usually try to see what gets me to buy a deal because i usually don't buy many things especially online and its usually within some deal concept where I feel like \"winning\" that I do.But to be honest, I did some napkin math and honestly, at least for my VPS (although Its usually idle but I have hosted many services on it or experimented with it, its honestly pretty fun imo, I definitely feel so much more freedom imo somehow after getting a vps its hard to explain I suppose or maybe not idk)But my napkin maths suggests that they lose quite a lot of money with atleast my deal in particular so I got better off getting this deal than say if I was netcup myself somehow (because they probably lose net money on my deal if I actually really use my allocated limits I guess) atleast for the 3 months but I feel like netcup's still one of the more cheaper options and I got a recurring discount deal with it too sooo I would still consider them to have only marginal profits over a long term deal as well.SO I guess overall, this was a really profitable deal for me.Your deal's pretty cool too, honestly at large scale. I have done scraping of lowendtalk and analyzed and done many decisions and infrastructural decisions and honestly I will say taht for anything somewhat large scale like you mention 32 gb or something, I found hetzner boxes to be the best/most referred to option & OVH kimsufi line is created to be the cheapest dedicated boxes.But yeah regarding OVH i recommend this website that I found regarding OVH KS line or just in general https://checkservers.ovhJust checked it right now and I see  Xeon E-2274G 4c / 8t 4.4 GHz+ 32 GB DDR4 ECC 2666 MHz 2 x 960 GB NVMe for around 37-38 euros ishAlso Netcup's definitely not small. I looked at anexia group and I wouldn't constitute them as small. For understanding what small means I guess when I mean small, I mean lowendbox single shop providers and others.Also regarding Netcup, its payment system was really ass from what I felt like. Like It was the first company which made me feel like I wanted to pay it money but I had to make a CCP or some account nad literally had to go through like 3-4 really long things imo which really made me say (wtf) in my head each time and frustrated me only to give me a stripe link in the end.It had me so pissed that for 2-3 days one idea of simplifying its whole process and other such providers stuck in my head. Its payment / the whole process of I want to pay -> create account -> actually pay had like 5-6 maybe 7 steps or something and I seriously can't tell you how I frustrated I was but the deal was too lucrative lol",

So I bought PUTs when it was at $102, protecting me at a strike of $96. These PUTs were pricey but, so far, worth it. But here comes the kicker: I'm financing those PUTs by selling CALLs on SLV (that simple options strategy is called a \"collar\").And as I'm a silverbug, I own silver coins too. But these aren't liquid as you noticed.When you trade paper silver (like the ETF SLV), the price of the market is the price of the market. SLV is not 100% following an ounce of silver's price, but SLV's market price is SLV's market price. It was $105 at close yesterday and $75 at close today and that's just the price of SLV.I do like that: not getting ripped off by some side-of-the-road hustler.That dude giving you $80 then giving you $35 is taking a more than 50% cut compared to the nearest low of day.

The timing is pretty clear.The 2024 election was a time of great uncertainty, and Trump's first year in power delivered a reality worse than the fears.  Trump is still throwing random tariff threats (and actual tariffs) around without rhyme or reason, but he's discovered that threatening to invade (allied) countries can stir things up even more effectively. Choosing a lackey to replace a competent federal reserve chair isn't going to help matters.  We're just one quarter of the way through Trump's presidency (assuming he lives and doesn't seek another term), and it seems like the uncertainty is just going to get worse.However, that uncertainty is, by no means, certain.  Domestic resistance and midterm elections could curb Trump's power.  International resistance is starting to coalesce.  e.g. The EU's threat to use their \"trade bazooka\" probably contributed to Trump's TACO on Greenland, as did the potential demise of NATO.  Responses to Trump's international graspings will likely become more prompt and more muscular, reducing the instability Trump can cause.  The system has been shocked, but now its adapting.  Many nations are hedging against U.S. centred uncertainty by pivoting to China or other allies.  Global markets will likely become more stable as nations learn how to work around Trump's chaos by working around the U.S..  Still, it's very possible that Trump will find new and \"creative\" ways to make everybody freak out again.Bottom line, the uncertainty that's been driving gold prices up since 2024 is going to let up at some point.  But when?  How overvalued will gold be when it does let up?",

          "content": "There's a lot going on here and it's not just the price going up and then going down (see my other comments). Basically, the entirely silver market is dysfunctional at the moment. And it's all about bailing out banks who are getting wiped out by the silver rally.So when you sell silver at a pawn shop or to a retail dealer, here's what happens in a normal market. You get an instant price, 5-10% off spot hopefully. That dealer then takes that silver and sells it to a refiner in higher volume with a lower margin (to spot). That's their profit. Refiners will convert that silver into bars and sell it to wholesalers and institutional buyers.But instead what's happening is the refiner needs to hold onto the silver for 7-14 days before it gets smelted and processed. With high volatility, they're not paying out the dealers until it's processed and sold. That's a huge cash flow problem. Instead of instant money, it's money in 2 weeks and you have no idea how much money.So the retail dealer has to wait and it could be 20% lower or 20% higher in the current market so instead of 5-10% they eitehr have to offer 30%+ less than spot price if they buy it at all. That money tied up has an opportunity cost.Combine this with a shortage of physical silver to deliver on futures contracts and the refiners aren't really getting the silver they need to satisfy that demand.So the spot price is fake. Nobody's buying anyway. Low wholesale supply means the prices continue to go up. Banks are haemorrhaging money because they have huge short positions. They have to borrow silver to meet their obligations and the silver lease rate (the price to borrow silver for a money has like 10x'ed) and this is where we are.",

While better is a subjective term, most alternatives have either not been successful or have not yet meaningfully achieved a level of success to matter.Flattr took one approach without much success.  They represented the problem well though.   When someone does something that is of a small but not insignificant benefit for a large number of people,  how should they be rewarded?    When the reward due, divided by the number of people paying for it, gets low enough it seems to not reach a threshold that it makes sense for any individual to pay.You could charge a fee above the threshold, and many people do take this path.  It is essentially requiring a small number of people to massively overpay to cover those who don't pay at all.A Universal Income takes the approach that if everyone gets what they need there is no particular requirement to be monetarily rewarded.  You essentially have been rewarded for whatever it is you do.Advertising plays the small threshold thing both ways,  They offer you a chance to sell a little corruption below your threshold for thinking it is damaging, and in return they accumulate the corruption and the money and send you the money and deliver the requested corruption to their customers.Part of the fundamental difficulty is in determining the size of the reward due.   How is that determined?   There are plenty of people who will offer services to do that if it means they can take a cut.  I don't see that path going well unless it is a mechanism governed by strict non-profit rules, and even then I would have doubts.A purely rule based system would be intrinsically unfair and subject to gaming,  but often times this turns out to be the least worst solution.

I've been using them for 10 years.They have very low self discharge so you can keep them on the shelf for a year and they will still have 70% charge which is very different to most rechargeable batteries.They don't leak unlike alkaline batteries and you can run them to 0% charge without damaging them unlike Lion batteries.The terminal voltage is only 1.2v so there is the occasional thing they don't work well in.That said my collection of eneloops get much less use than they used to as everything comes with built in lithium batteries and a usb charger nowadays. That is very convenient until the moment the lithium battery dies...Changing the lithium battery in things sucks. Firstly it's really difficult to get a good one and not a crappy knock off. Secondly modern stuff isn't meant to be repaired. Every time I pick up my kindle I shed a small tear when I see the screen damage I caused changing the battery.So, I buy stuff with AA or AAA batteries if possible and if I want it to last for more than 3 years.",

It had a small rectangular rechargeable lithium battery that was charged via a DC jack.At one point I hadn’t kept it charged, the battery went completely flat, and after that it would no longer charge at all. When I called the company, they said the battery was now too deeply discharged and required an “intelligent” charger to revive it. They sent a charger with a slot for the bare battery; some LEDs blinked in various patterns for a while, and eventually normal charging resumed.I’ve always wondered what that charger actually did, that the built-in charger was not capable of. Was it performing some kind of analysis to decide whether the battery was safe to recover (e.g. after deep discharge), or was it simply applying some initial charge ignoring the battery’s protection circuitry (and at what risk)?",

Because it’s a new thing, there is not enough training samples displaying that behavior.They also cannot enforce that via RL because skills use human language, which is ambiguous and not formal. Force it to use skills always via RL policy and you’ll make the model dumber.So, right now, we are generating usage traces that will be used to train the future models to get a better grasp of when to use skills not.

E.g. you could imagine Claude passing the prompt + skills frontmatter to Haiku to selectively decide what to include before passing to Sonnet or Opus.

LLMs vacillate wildly while maintaining sycophancy and arrogance.Human egos make them unlikely to admit error, sometimes, but that fragile ego also gives them shame and a vision of glory.  An egotistical programmer won’t deliver flat garbage for fear of being exposed as inferior, and can be cajoled towards reasonable output with reward structures and clear political rails.  LLMs fail hilariously and shamelessly in indiscriminate fashion. They don’t care, and will happily argue both sides of anything.Also that thing that LLMs don’t actually learn. You can threaten to chop their fingers off if they do something again… they don’t have fingers, they don’t recall, and can’t actually tell if they did the thing. “I’m not lying, oops I am, no I’m not, oops I am… lemme delete the home directory and see if that helps…”If we’re going to make an analogy to a human, LLMs reliably act like absolute psychopaths with constant disassociation. They lie, lie about lying, and lie about following instructions.I agree LLMs better than your average junior first time following first directives.  I’m far less convinced about that story over time, as the dialog develops more effective juniors over time.",

I then went back to add a test by hand, and after looking more closely at the output there were like 50 wtf worthy things scattered in there. Sure they ran, but it was bad in all sorts of ways. And this was just writing something very basic.This has been my experience almost every time I use AI: superficially it seems fine, once I go to extend the code I realize it's a disaster and I have to clean it up.The problem with \"code is cheap\" is that, it's not. GENERATING code is now cheap (while the LLMs are subsidized by endless VC dollars, anyway), but the cost of owning that code is not. Every line of code is a liability, and generating thousands of lines a day is like running up a few thousand dollars of debt on a credit card thinking you're getting free stuff and then being surprised when it gets declined.",

Programming is planning, and programming languages are surprisingly good planning tools. But, of course, becoming an expert is hard and requires not only some general aptitude but also substantial time, experience and effort.My theory is that this is a source of diverging views on LLMs for programming: people who see programming languages as tools for thought compared to people who see programming languages as, exclusively, tools to make computers do stuff. It's no surprise that the former would see more value in programming qua programming, while the latter are happy to sweep code under the rug.The fundamental problem, of course, is that anything worth doing in code is going to involve pinning down a massive amount of small details. Programming languages are formal systems with nice (well, somewhat nice) UX, and formal systems are great for, well, specifying details. Human text is not.Then again, while there might be a lot of details, there are also a lot of applications where the details barely matter. So why not let a black box make all the little decisions?The question boils down to where you want to spend more energy: developing and articulating a good conceptual model up-front, or debugging a messy system later on. And here, too, I've found programmers fall into two distinct camps, probably for the same reasons they differ in their views on LLMs.In principle, LLM capabilities could be reasonably well-suited to the up-front thinking-oriented programming paradigm. But, in practice, none of the tools or approaches popular today—certainly none of the ones I'm familiar with—are oriented in that direction. We have a real tooling gap.",

They meant all the rest are architectural decisions & just everything surrounding the code. Quite frankly, the idea behind Ai/LLM's is to automate that too and convert it into pure text and I feel like the average layman significantly overestimates what AI can and cannot do.So the whole notion of show me the talk atleast in a more non engineering background as more people try might be net negative not really understanding the tech as is and quite frankly even engineers are having a hard time catching up with all which is happening.I do feel like that the AI industry just has too many words floating right now. To be honest, I don't want to talk right now, let me use the tool and see how it goes and have a moment of silence. The whole industry is moving faster than the days till average js framework days.To have a catchy end to my comment: There is just too much talk nowadays. Show me the trust.I do feel like information has become saturated and we are transitioning from the \"information\" age to \"trust\" age.

      "abstract": "该讨论围绕用Rust重写的SQLite替代品Turso展开。核心争议在于用户对其技术深度和长期可持续性的质疑。多数用户认为文章名为“深度解析”但内容浅显，未能深入技术细节。  \n\n社区普遍认同SQLite经过长期实战测试更为可靠。有人认为Turso作为VC支持的初创公司，其开发可持续性存疑，且当前过度依赖AI热潮增长用户；也有用户指出Rust重写虽带来内存安全优势，但初期可能因缺乏长期测试而比现有方案更脆弱。讨论中提到用户对其测试套件未完全开源表示困惑，并关联了此前关于Turso突破SQLite单写限制的讨论。  \n\n整体上，社区对Turso持谨慎态度，肯定其尝试但更看重技术的成熟度与稳定性。",

I can easily see how SQLite's development is sustainable, but not Turso's. They're currently trying to grow their userbase as quickly as possible with their free open source offering, but when they have investors breathing down their necks asking about how they're going to get 100x returns I'm not sure how long that'll last. VCs generally expect companies they invest in to grow to $100 million in revenue in 5-10 years. If your use of their technology doesn't help them get there, you should expect to be rugpulled at some point.",

Preserving a project for the sake of preserving it isn't a good idea.If people need to run a sqlite db in these exotic places, shedding it means someone else has to build their own tool now that can do it.

Slower than C++ for sure. There haven't been any big, significant changes to the language since async. Code that compiles today should compile indefinitely. (And the rust compiler authors check this on every release, by recompiling basically everything in crates.io to make sure.)> - Rust needs to demonstrate that it can be used to create general-purpose libraries that are callable from all other programming languages.Rust matches C in this regard. You can import & export C functions from rust very easily. The consumer of the foreign function interface have no idea they're calling rust and not C.> - Rust needs to demonstrate that it can produce object code that works on obscure embedded devices, including devices that lack an operating system.Rust works pretty well on raw / embedded hardware via #[no_std]. There's a few obscure architectures supported by gcc and not llvm (and by extension rust). But it generally works great. I'd love to know what the real blocker platforms are (if any).> - Rust needs to pick up the necessary tooling that enables one to do 100% branch coverage testing of the compiled binaries.Uh, I think this is possible today? Rustrover (intellij) can certainly produce coverage reports. This doesn't feel out of reach.> - Rust needs a mechanism to recover gracefully from OOM errors.True. You can override the global allocator for a program and use that to detect OOM. But recovering from OOM in general is tricky. I personally wish rust's handling of allocators looked more like zig.> - Rust needs to demonstrate that it can do the kinds of work that C does in SQLite without a significant speed penalty.Rust and C are pretty much even when it comes to performance.

Doctors do not like to tell you the good and the bad candidly - it's always \"we'll see what the next test says but things look positive\" and \"it could be as soon as 1 week or as long as several months depending on what we find\" when they know full well you're in there for 2 months at minimum you're a miracle case.

The level of reassurance that I was doing everything right actually made me feel less scared, because it was a pretty serious problem. Everything it told me was 100% correct and it guided me perfectly.I was taking one high blood pressure medication but then noticed my blood sugar jumped. I did some research with ChatGPT and it found a paper that did indicate that it could raise blood sugar levels and gave me a recommendation for an alternative  I asked my doctor about it and she said I was wrong, but I gently pushed her to switch and gave the recommended medication. She obliged, which is why I have kept her for almost 30 years now, and lo and behold, my blood sugar did drop.Most people have a hard time pushing back against doctors and doctors mostly work with blinders on and don't listen. ChatGPT gives you the ability to keep asking questions without thinking you are bothering them.I think ChatGPT is a great advance in terms of medical help in my opinion and I recommend it to everyone.

It even pointed out the no swelling could be due to a very small tear etc. It gave me a 90% chance of surgery too.I followed up by asking what test would definitely prove it one way or the other and it mentioned getting an X-Ray.We go off to the urgent care, son is already kind of hobbling around.

You might get into a conversation with a physician which goes strange and they end up telling you that their clinic gets health inspections like a restaurant... they don't.

The hospitalization rate might be 1:5000 and the death rate 1:100000 but if you do a million of these there are going to be a few. If the procedure took place in a clinic it's supposed to be reported, and the reports are public record; but surprise surprise, the reported rates for serious complications are far far below what the actuarial tables show.If you're seeing constellations of incidents similar to these, you need to get a second opinion from somewhere / somebody who is not caught up in that particular bubble.

Essentially I plugged in all of the data I could from my own observations of my issue over a 35 year period. It settled on these 3 possibilities: \"Functional Dyspepsia with slow gastric accommodation, Mild delayed gastric emptying (even subclinical), Visceral hypersensitivity (your nerves fire pain signals when stretched)\" and suggested a number of strategies to help with this. I implemented many of them and my stomach pain has been non-existent for months now... longer than I have ever been pain free.I feel like the difference is that doctors took what I told them and only partially listened. They never took it especially seriously and just went straight to standard tests and treatments (scopes, biopsies and various stomach acid impacting medications). ChatGPT took some of what I said and actually considered it, discounting some things and digging into others (I said that bitter beer helped... doctor laughed at that, ChatGPT said that the alcohol probably did not help but that the bittering agent might and it was correct). ChatGPT got me somewhere better than where I was previously... something no doctor was able to do.",

My bet here would be that once you can talk to other people personal context maybe inside the organisation you can cut many meetings.And more science fiction, if you connect all different minds together and combine all knowledge accumulated from people and allow bots to talk to each and create new pieces of information by collaboration this could lead to a distributed learning eraCounter argument would be that people are on average mid IQ and not much of the greatest work could be produced by combining mid IQ people together.But probably throwing an experiment in some big AI lab or some big corporation could be a very interesting experiment to see an outcome of.

The real value often comes not from the resulting product, but from the lessons learned along the way.\nI also don't see what's wrong with showcasing the results of your experiments. How many developers have implemented a toy ray tracer and put it on their personal GitHub? No one in their right mind believes Pixar will use it for their next renderer, but should we conclude those people are inflating their CVs with bait? Or can we acknowledge it's a cool project to undertake, and pulling it off requires real skill?\nIf individuals are welcome to do this, why can't organizations?

Plus some bells and whistles.The part about chat integration is something that I wanted to have even before LLMs were a thing, because I hate modern communication apps with burning fashion. All popular IM apps in particular[0] are just user-hostile prisons whose vendors go out of their way to make interoperability and end-user automation impossible. There's too much of that, and for a decade or more I dreamed of centralizing all these independent networks for myself in a single app. I considered working on the problem a few times, but the barriers vendors put up were always too much for my patience.So here I thought, maybe someone solved this problem. That alone would be valuable.Having an LLM, especially BYOK, in your main IM app? That's a no-brainer to me too; I think it's a travesty this is not a default feature already. Especially these days, as a parent, I find a good chunk of my IM use involves manually copy-pasting messages and photos to some LLM to turn them into reminders and calendar invites. And that's one of many use cases I have for tight IM/LLM integration.So here I thought maybe this project will be a quick and easy way to finally get a sane, end-user-programmable chat experience. Shame to see it might be vaporware and/or a scam.--[0] - Excepting Telegram, which has a host of other problems - but I'd be fine living with them; unfortunately, everyone I need to communicate with uses either WhatsApp or Facebook Messenger these days.",

          "content": "Honestly, these two paragraphs are one of the most compelling things they could possibly say in a press release:> Stargaze already has a proven track record in its utility for space safety. In late 2025, a Starlink satellite encountered a conjunction with a third-party satellite that was performing maneuvers, but whose operator was not sharing ephemeris. Until five hours before the conjunction, the close approach was anticipated to be ~9,000 meters—considered a safe miss-distance with zero probability of collision. With just five hours to go, the third-party satellite performed a maneuver which changed its trajectory and collapsed the anticipated miss distance to just ~60 meters. Stargaze quickly detected this maneuver and published an updated trajectory to the screening platform, generating new CDMs which were immediately distributed to relevant satellites. Ultimately, the Starlink satellite was able to react within an hour of the maneuver being detected, planning an avoidance maneuver to reduce collision risk back down to zero.> With so little time to react, this would not have been possible by relying on legacy radar systems or high-latency conjunction screening processes. If observations of the third-party satellite were less frequent, conjunction screening took longer, or the reaction required human approval, such an event might not have been successfully mitigated.Looks like a non-trivial upgrade to previous systems, and they're making Stargaze's data available to other satellite operators free of charge. Nice!",

Every morning, I'd come in, slide my hard drive sled in, and turn the computer on. We had 128 Kbps ISDN internet at the office and I had the same at home, but that was too slow to do much work. So I'd take the drive home so I could work at night, especially in the winter when the office was too cold at night.Suddenly one winter morning, the PC wouldn't boot. I had to run to a meeting. When I got back, I turned the PC off and on again and everything was fine. The next morning, the same thing happened. The third day, I didn't have a meeting. I turned it off and back on, still no boot. I'd gotten in late, so I just turned it off and took an early lunch. When I got back, it still wouldn't boot. But I had a meeting, so I ran to that, leaving the computer on. When I got back, it booted fine.The next morning, same thing. I decided to look inside, not having any idea what might cause such symptoms. As I took the shell off, a tiny mouse came out, jump off my desk, and ran across my lap before jumping on the floor and scurrying out of sight. From inside the computer came the smell of mouse urine. Apparently he'd been crawling in through the open drive bay to keep warm every night, and urinating while he was in there. Once the computer had been on for a while, the heat and airflow would dry it out enough to eliminate whatever electrical short was keeping it from booting. I went to the store and bought an empty drive sled to put in the drive bay whenever I took my drive out, and the problem never came back. I felt lucky that the liquid didn't cause permanent damage.",

Or jump to just before it dies and see if it plays through.If by \"downloaded\" you mean The High Seas, those who provision the high seas are often on the cutting edge of using codecs with every last feature turned on to make the videos smaller to squeeze every last bit out of the encodings that they can, which can make them unusually expensive to decode.

He said you have to figure out what's different. It sounds obvious or simple, but if you go with that mindset, when someone's stuck in the \"it works on my machine idk why\" sure enough I ask \"what is DIFFERENT from your machine and this one?\" and it almost always leads to the right answers.

          "content": "Replying very late, but with an actual answer.It turns out that yes, better forecasts is a large part of what motivated the launch of this instrument.High-spectral-resolution IR spectra at GEO allow estimation of vertically-resolved temperature and water vapor (over large spatial areas, at high temporal cadence), which are then assimilated. Forecasts and nowcasts thus improve.These \"spectra-to-get-temperature-and-water\" measurements were pioneered by other instruments in LEO (e.g., NASA's AIRS, https://airs.jpl.nasa.gov/mission/overview/), but LEO does not provide enough coverage to help forecasts.To understand the benefits of GEO IR spectra, we do \"OSSE's\" (Observing System Simulation Experiments) to quantify how much improvement you get. You take a \"Nature Run\", make simulated observations (existing and proposed), and see if there is an improvement. (Since the Nature Run, which you made, provided ground truth, you can judge if there really was an improvement.)Thankfully, many people have already done this. See: https://www.ssec.wisc.edu/geo-ir-sounder/osse/In particular, looking at the figure there from Li et al., compare panels:* (d) -- (Nature Run) - (existing data) (\"CNTRL\")* (e) -- (Nature Run) - (existing data + GEO IR)which both show differences between the Nature Run (NR) and the forecast.The RMSE improvement (on a CONUS storm) is given as RMS of 0.55 (existing) versus 0.43 (with GEO IR), in degrees Kelvin. So that's 0.12 Kelvin or 0.22 Fahrenheit. Also, and probably more interestingly, the spatial pattern changes.There are a lot of OSSE's reported on that page for these sounders. NASA is also conducting OSSE studies for a more ambitious multi-spacecraft observing system (https://science.nasa.gov/earth-science/decadal-surveys/decad...).Studies like this (i.e., OSSEs like the ones above) are one of the main ways we decide how to build the next instruments -- what provides the most benefits vs. cost, which system parameters to push to improve and which are good enough.",

I'd be surprised if MAE, over the 15 days the prediction spans, would improve more than 0.1 C, if we talk about the raw prediction.\nThere are plenty of things that this data is used for, but I would say that improved nowcast of cloud coverage, and energy production related parameters are likely to benefit most from the improvement in resolution.",

The founders wrote their masters thesis on object detection and pattern recognition using sentinel imaging. They had basically one product: to detect certain objects. After a couple of years they had gotten a handful of customers (basically they'd receive coordinates to some are of interest, and then tasked with trying to detect something), which afforded them to purchase commercial data (from other types of sensors) for building more robust systems. This in turn grew their customer bas, and they started adding products.Then they were acquired by one of the largest private space companies.But, in any case, it all started with access to free data.

It would be expensive to give the public access. I used to host these types of data sets for EU countries. The workload just from authorized users is resource intensive, it doesn't scale cheaply.

Also, they seem to say that this spectral resolution would enable them to retrieve temperature and humidity as a function of height -- not just surface temperature and column-integrated water content (\"humidity\").Aha, here's a nice link (https://www.ssec.wisc.edu/geo-ir-sounder/) on exactly this question, pointing out the NASA IR sounders that have existed for many years (AIRS).

      "abstract": "该帖子讨论了Netflix作为企业赞助商加入Blender开发基金的消息。核心话题围绕Blender作为开源3D创作工具的发展前景及其对行业的影响。\n\n社区普遍对Blender的进步表示赞赏，有人认为自2.8版本界面大改后，Blender已进入快速发展轨道，成为可与商业软件竞争的专业工具。也有用户指出，开源软件在获得适当资金支持后（如Netflix的24万欧元赞助）能有效推动创新，形成“工具越好用→吸引专业用户→获得更多投资”的良性循环。\n\n讨论中出现的分歧主要体现在两方面：一是对Blender使用体验的评价，有用户抱怨其默认快捷键设计不符合行业习惯，即使切换到“行业兼容”模式仍存在学习成本；二是对赞助规模的争议，部分用户认为大型科技公司应提供更慷慨的资助（如百万美元级捐赠），以加速开源生态发展。\n\n此外，讨论还衍生出两个次要话题：有用户质疑Netflix招聘流程的透明度，反映投递简历后长期未获回复；另有用户好奇Blender与Maya的当前对比情况，但未展开深入讨论。整体而言，社区共识是Blender正在改变数字内容创作格局，而企业赞助将进一步加强其发展势头。",

There was decades of battery acid corrosion that took a ton of cleaning and resoldering and reflowing the screen connections.After hours and hours of iterations I could get it to work perfectly, just once, for each cartridge. I would clean it a bit more, try a game, things would work great. I’d try another game and it the copyright logo would fail. So I’d clean it up a bit more.  Swab the port and try it again. It worked! Then another game… nope.I eventually realized that the isopropanol was making a weak connection work fine, and then I guess it just kept working once power was flowing.No matter what I tried I couldn’t get it to stay fixed, so I keep a handful of cotton swabs and a small dispenser of isopropanol in the carrying case. I’ll swab a cartridge before inserting it and it works every time.So now I have a Game Boy that requires alcohol to work.",

Back in 2013, when my grandmother moved into the then-new house, I setup a point-to-point wifi bridge between them to share my parents' Internet connection and give me easy remote support access to grandma.Summer of 2023 visiting relatives complained the Internet service in grandma's house was slow and unreliable. There were repeated suggestions made by helpful relatives for purchasing a new WiFi router for her house, getting independent Internet service, etc.Grandma was happy with it, and the relatives went home, so I put off looking at it. When I did finally look at it, months later (when I went over for Thanksgiving) everything seemed fine.When the relatives came to visit in summer 2024 they complained again. I looked at it immediately and found massive packet loss on both ends.The ornamental trees planted along the driveway between the houses were the culprit. With the leaves off (say, at Thanksgiving time) it was fine. When the relatives came to visit in the summer the trees were in full leaf and acting as very good attenuators.The trees were newly planted when grandma moved in. I didn't even think about them getting bigger and fuller when I set up the link. They filled out in the 10 years intervening, though. (Chalk it up to me still being relatively young and not thinking about installations on 10+ year timescales when I put it up.)Fortunately there's a room in her house with line of sight to my parents' house unobscured by trees. It meant putting the radio outside a bedroom window instead of the attic (where I'd originally stashed it), but it solved the problem and ended complaints from relatives.",

But of course I couldn’t see my password as I typed, while in other cases I would subconsciously correct any resulting typos because I could see them.

It generally works well as an AP and I'm getting full speeds.  However, for some reason whenever I try to communicate directly with the router/firewall (separate device on the same network) through this AP, it will intermittently drop 3/4 packets.  It only happens when communicating with the router/firewall device, and only over the wlan interface on the bpi-r4.  I have a similar AP setup on another embedded system (PCEngines APU2) and this has never  been an issue.I suspect there's some sort of bug with the internal 4-port switch of the bpi-r4 not playing well with the wlan interface when they're all bridged together, but digging through the logs hasn't revealed anything obvious.It's driving me nuts!",

What happens instead is that the RPM goes too low, and the engine shuts off, then the start/stop feature kicks in and restarts the engine. This happens every few seconds repeatedly. If I press the accelerator it can keep running. And if I just drive a meter or two it will work fine again when I go back to idling.I tried both with neutral or in gear but with the clutch pressed (yes, it is a manual, fairly common in Sweden still) and that doesn't make a difference.I haven't managed to figure out the cause, but since it is a modern car I would assume it is something with the ECU that goes wrong.

I built a four-wheeled version and even that is beautifully smooth when one wheel goes over a bump because the chasis maintains an average orientation based on the positions of all the wheels. The video shows an 8-wheeled one but it still only has two rows of wheels. I've wondered how to generalize it to an arbitrarily sized grid of wheels so a vehicle would be like a flexible mat that conforms to the ground. I couldn't work that out but I'm no Don Bickler. FEA software has a feature called \"RBE3\" which models an even more general case of any number of \"wheels\" and they can also move in any direction while still keeping the orientation of the \"chassis\" (dependent node) rigidly determined by their average displacements. The \"R\" stands for rigid because every part is rigid or completely free - no springs! There seems to be nothing like it in machines or nature but it's a beuatifully elegent and seemingly natural mechanism - if it was possible to build.",

I'm sure there are much more straightforward ways of accomplishing the same stuff.Imo the biggest advantage of reproducing humanoid forms, is that then the robot can be teleoperated with full body harnesses that track the human operator. One such system I like really much, is what the Japanese use for fixing overhead power wires - it looks like a humanoid robot torso mated to a mobile crane.Altough the technology behind that could be done in the 80s, with electromechanical analog controls.",

      "abstract": "该讨论围绕HTTP状态码趣味网站HTTP Cats展开。核心话题是该网站通过猫咪图片帮助开发者记忆HTTP状态码的实用性与趣味性。多数用户对网站表示认可，认为其直观易记、加载迅速，已成为日常工作查询状态码的“肌肉记忆”。讨论中提到，有用户分享类似创意项目，如用狗狗图片呈现状态码的替代网站，也有人推荐其他风格的状态码工具。争议点主要集中在个别状态码的呈现方式上，例如有人认为404错误码的图片应只显示猫脚印而非猫咪本身。此外，有用户指出部分非常规状态码（如420）在浏览器中的识别问题，并列举了历年相关讨论以供参考。整体上，社区普遍认为这类趣味工具能有效辅助开发工作，同时为技术学习增添轻松氛围。",

The facial expression is too good, and the smoothness of the background is too perfect. Has to be AI.\"For the curious, it's the same photo as on my LinkedIn:https://www.linkedin.com/in/michaelgeary/What they didn't know was how I took that selfie. I set up my Micro Four Thirds camera on a tripod in the front yard, with the world's best portrait lens: the Olympus 75mm f/1.8. I stood some 10-15 feet from it (this lens is equivalent to a 150mm lens on a full frame camera, i.e. a moderate telephoto) and used the remote control to take a few dozen shots as I let my face relax into various expressions.I picked out 4-5 favorites and asked a friend about them. She said \"This one. It has gravitas.\"I don't even think it's that great a photo. But I suppose the \"gravitas\" makes it look like AI.For a photo that really shows off what that 75mm lens can do, check out this one of our late dog Brownie, titled Pumpkin Brownie:https://geary.smugmug.com/Pets/Dogs/i-dNMQW2v/A",

Opus, GLM-4.7 have both complemented Kimi on it's writing.Still mainly using my z.ai glm-4.7 subscription for the work, so I don't know how capable it really is. But I do tend to go for some Opus in sticky spots, and especially given the 9x price difference, I should try some Kimi. I wish I was set up for better parallel evaluation; feels like such a pain to get started.",

And unlike a hacked system where you notice something's off, a flaky agent just... occasionally does the wrong thing. Sometimes it works. Sometimes it doesn't. Figuring out which case you're in requires building the same observability infrastructure you'd use for any unreliable distributed system.The people running these connected to their email or filesystem aren't just accepting prompt injection risk. They're accepting that their system will randomly succeed or fail at tasks depending on model performance that day, and they may not notice the failures until later.",

          "content": "My 13yo son recently discovered Godot and I'm very impressed by how accessible and powerful it all is. He had started gamedev a few years ago with Scratch. Figured out Roblox Studio a fair amount, but it's super quirky, plus he wanted to do 2D games. Tried some other stuff (eg pygame) but that's just super low level, inaccessible, plus you can't properly distribute pygame games for shit. Godot is on a whole nother level.I had never bothered pointing him to it, because I remembered Godot as \"a bunch of C++ libraries for gamedev\". I'm not even sure whether that's ever been the case or just an incorrect memory, but today's Godot is incomparable to that. The editor UI is very full featured, and you can easily make simple 2D games with relatively small amounts of programming. It includes a level editor, animation stuff, and so on. It's just very feature complete, and I think it's very impressive for a FOSS project to be so accessible to newcomers stumbling into it by chance. Points also to the people making videos.Also sidenote I think GDScript is great. My son had tried Unity first, but the C# compile cycle was so slow that he kept getting out of the flow. As a developer dad, Godot's GDScript struck me as a super weird \"not invented here\" thing at first, but realizing what tradeoffs they're going for (familiarity, fast edit-compile-run cycle, concurrency, lightweight binding to C++ internals, etc), I now see the point completely. I'm sure it has plenty quirks but for a beginner like my son it's a perfect fit.Bottom line, he was able to make a Flappy Bird clone and put it on his Android phone, totally solo (except the Android export, and with lots of YouTube support), in like two afternoons. Drew the art, coded the dynamics, everything. Hats off to the Godot team!",

There's also things like this https://github.com/godotengine/godot/issues/86926 and that the underlying types aren't compatible (Godot collections) that make it clear they aren't serious with the C# support.The other huge problem is the terrible external editor support, it does not work well at all. This means your vim, jetbrains, whatever muscle memory from a lifetime of professional dev work becomes useless, and you have to use a gimped text editor worse than notepad++. You can use an external editor, but then lots of things don't work very well, scenes get randomly corrupted, hot reloading doesn't work, etc. It's many issues like this that prove Godot's only priority is attracting and entertaining people who have never written code before, instead of making an engine viable for shipping games.I gave Godot a real chance for years, but at the end of the day it's a toy. There's a good reason that there are barely any games using it, and they're all extremely technically simple; surprisingly, that reason is not an unsophisticated underlying engine, but rather a million DX papercuts that a good ambitious developer would just never accept.",
