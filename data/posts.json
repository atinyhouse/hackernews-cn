      "abstract": "该讨论围绕“不要陷入反AI炒作”展开，核心话题是评估当前AI编程工具的实际能力与局限性。多数用户认为AI工具（如GPT、Claude）在特定编码任务中能提升效率，尤其适合处理明确、狭窄的问题，但无法独立完成复杂项目。\n\n有人认为AI本质上是高级搜索引擎，能快速提供代码片段，但在需要深度领域知识或创造性解决方案的非琐碎任务中，结果往往不可靠。也有用户指出，过度宣传AI能“几乎无需协助”完成中型项目是夸张的，实际使用中仍需人工引导和反复调试。讨论中提到，部分开发者担忧AI工具可能导致编程热情减退，但另一方观点认为AI能 democratize 编程，帮助小团队更快开发软件。\n\n共识在于，AI工具值得谨慎尝试并融入工作流，但不应高估其当前能力。分歧主要体现在对AI自动化潜力的判断：一些用户认为AI将显著改变开发方式，另一些则坚持其辅助性质，强调人类工程师的不可替代性。",

          "content": "I don't understand the stance that AI currently is able to automate away non-trivial coding tasks. I've tried this consistently since GPT 3.5 came out, with every single SOTA model up to GPT 5.1 Codex Max and Opus 4.5. Every single time, I get something that works, yes, but then when I start self-reviewing the code, preparing to submit it to coworkers, I end up rewriting about 70% of the thing. So many important details are subpar about the AI solution, and many times fundamental architectural issues cripple any attempt at prompting my way out of it, even though I've been quite involved step-by-step through the whole prototyping phase.I just have to conclude 1 of 2 things:1) I'm not good at prompting, even though I am one of the earliest AI in coding adopters I know, and have been consistent for years. So I find this hard to accept.2) Other people are just less picky than I am, or they have a less thorough review culture that lets subpar code slide more often.I'm not sure what else I can take from the situation. For context, I work on a 15 year old Java Spring + React (with some old pages still in Thymeleaf) web application. There are many sub-services, two separate databases,and this application needs to also 2-way interface with customer hardware. So, not a simple project, but still. I can't imagine it's way more complicated than most enterprise/legacy projects...",

For the “non-trivial” questions, there always will be multiple answers, and you’ll get from the LLM all of these depending on the precise words you use to prompt it. You won’t get the best answer, and in a complex scenario requiring highly recursive cross-checks— some answers you get won’t be functional.It’s not readily apparent at first blush the LLM is doing this, giving all the answers. And, for a novice who doesn’t know the options, or an expert who can scan a list of options quickly and steer the LLM, it’s incredibly useful. But giving all the answers without strong guidance on non-trivial architectural points— entropy. LLMs churning independently quickly devolve into entropy.",

Initially it seemed like I received a bunch of very negative comments, now I read most of the thread, and there are very good points, articulated with sensibility. Thank you.I wanted to provide some more context that is not part of the blog post. Since somebody may believe I don't enjoy / love the act of writing code.1. I care a lot about programming, I love creating something from scratch, line by line. But: at this point, I want to do programming in a way that makes me special, compared to machines. When the LLM hits a limit, and I write a function in a way it can't compete, that is good.2. If I write a very small program that is like a small piece of poetry, this is good human expression. I'll keep doing this as well.3. But, if I need to develop a feature, and I have a clear design idea, and I can do it in 2 hours instead of 2 weeks, how to justify to myself that, just for what I love, I will use a lot more time? That would be too much of ego-centric POV, I believe.4. For me too this is painful, as a transition, but I need to adapt. Fortunately I also enjoyed a lot the design / ideas process, so I can focus on that. And write code myself when needed.5. The reason why I wrote this piece is because I believe there are still a lot of people that are unprepared for the fact we are going to be kinda of obsolete in what defined us, as a profession: the ability to write code. A complicated ability requiring a number of skills at the same time, language skills, algorithms, problem decomposition. Since this is painful, and I believe we are headed in a certain direction, I want to tell the other folks in programming to accept reality. It will be easier, this way.",

For me, I initially got into programming because I wanted to ruin other people's websites, then I figured out I needed to know how to build websites first, then I found it more fun to create and share what I've done with others, and they tell me what they think of it. That's my \"fire\". But I've met so many people who doesn't care an iota about sharing what they built with others, it matters nothing to them.I guess the conclusion is, not all programmers program for the same reason, for some of us, LLMs helps a lot, and makes things even more fun. For others, LLMs remove the core part of what makes programming fun for them.

It's hard to say for sure as I left my crystal ball in my other jacket. But it will certainly be different. And those who are predisposed for programming in the old-school way may not find the field as attractive because it is no longer the same sort of engineering, something like the difference between the person that designs a Lego set and the person that assembles a Lego set.

Now, it seems much more like a matter of time.Ultimately I think over the next two years or so, Anthropic and OpenAI will evolve their product from \"coding assistant\" to \"engineering team replacement\", which will include standard tools and frameworks that they each specialize in (vendor lock in, perhaps), but also ways to plug in other tech as well. The idea being, they market directly to the product team, not to engineers who may have specific experience with one language, framework, database, or whatever.I also think we'll see a revival of monolithic architectures. Right now, services are split up mainly because project/team workflows are also distributed so they can be done in parallel while minimizing conflicts.

At the time SAP first appeared I would guess about 1% of the older programmers were interested in it—using SAP was “sissy stuff”, and a real programmer would not stoop to wasting machine capacity to do the assembly. Yes! Programmers wanted no part of it, though when pressed they had to admit their old methods used more machine time in locating and fixing up errors than the SAP program ever used. One of the main complaints was when using a symbolic system you do not know where anything was in storage—though in the early days we supplied a mapping of symbolic to actual storage, and believe it or not they later lovingly pored over such sheets rather than realize they did not need to know that information if they stuck to operating within the system—no!

However, that domain is computer vision. So I can literally \"see\" if the code works or not!To expand, I've set up tests, benchmarks and tools that generate results as images. I chat with the LLM about a specific problem at hand, it presents various solutions, I pick a promising approach, it writes the code, I run the tests which almost always pass, but if they don't, I can hone in on the problem quickly with a visual check of the relevant images.This has allowed me to make progress despite my lack of background. Interestingly, I've now built up some domain knowledge through learning by doing and experimenting (and soon, shipping)!These days I think an agent could execute this whole loop by itself by \"looking\" at the test and result images itself. I've uploaded test images to the LLM and we had technical conversations about them as if it \"saw\" them like a human. However, there are ton of images and I don't want to burn the tokens at this point.The upshot is, if you can set up a way of reliably testing and validating the LLM's output, you could still achieve things in an unfamiliar domain without prior expertise.Taking your Postgres example, it's a heavily tested and benchmarked project. I would bet someone like Antirez would be able to jump in and do original, valid work using AI very quickly, because even if hasn't futzed with Postgres code, he HAS futzed with a LOT of other code and hence has a deep intuition about software architecture in general.So this is what I meant by the meaning of \"domain expert\" changing.

Because an x.0 release inevitably has issues, it offers less than a year of stability (sometimes only a few months if it takes until x.4 to be fully stable) before things get broken again in y.0. And because Apple stops signing old versions pretty quickly, you’re often stuck on an unstable new version if you take the risk and upgrade.Additionally, it is hard on all developers (Apple included) to release updates for all of its many platforms on the same day, which IMO reduces software quality across the ecosystem.(Apple also has the luxury of only supporting the latest OS versions with its software.

And when you switch, you start noticing all those others features you never noticed before, because they are now gone.

You can buy a used, powerful laptop cheap, install Linux on it and try to use it for a time, keeping your other machines around. Chances are you'll find various trade-offs - Linux will NOT be a strict improvement, it will have downsides. Linux is particularly weak with power management and certain devices like fingerprint readers. Depending on the apps you use, it can be weak there, too.

Everything from being able to clearly distinguish UI elements, to general accessibility, to discoverability, everything got worse.Operating Systems are one of the most complicated systems we created, not because they're a collection of processes and thread, but because everything is built on top of them and creating something that's well thought out and stable, and intuitive is really hard. Designers just randomly creating visual elements just because it looks cool and not paying attention how people are going to use it is simply half assing the whole thing.That's still one of the reasons I believe Alan Dye was let go, fired in a sense, he had power over the company, but with that power he screwed things so much that we need to rediscover all the things related to usability in very high detail as if we're rediscovering the wheel, just so that we can get back to square one.",

          "content": "I worked on Finder/TimeMachine/Spotlight/iOS at Apple from 2000-2007. I worked closely with Bas Ording, Stephen Lemay, Marcel van Os, Imran Chaudry, Don Lindsey and Greg Christie. I have no experience with any of the designers who arrived in the post-Steve era. During my time, Jony Ive didn't figure prominently in the UI design, although echoes of his industrial design appeared in various ways in the graphic design of the widgets. Kevin Tiene and Scott Forstall had more influence for better or worse, extreme skeumorphism for example.The UX group would present work to Steve J. every Thursday and Steve quickly passed judgement often harshly and without a lot of feedback, leading to even longer meetings afterward to try and determine course corrections. Steve J. and Bas were on the same wavelength and a lot of what Bas would show had been worked on directly with Steve before hand. Other things would be presented for the first time, and Steve could be pretty harsh. Don, Greg, Scott, Kevin would push back and get abused, but they took the abuse and could make in-roads.Here is my snapshot of Stephen from the time. He presented the UI ideas for the intial tabbed window interface in Safari. He had multiple design ideas and Steve dismissed them quickly and harshly. Me recollection was that Steve said something like No, next, worse, next, even worse, next, no. Why don't you come back next week with something better. Stephen didn't push back, say much, just went ok and that was that. I think Greg was the team manager at the time and pushed Steve for more input and maybe got some. This was my general observation of how Stephen was over 20 years ago.I am skeptical and doubtful about Stephen's ability to make a change unless he is facilitated greatly by someone else or has somehow changed drastically. The fact that he has been on the team while the general opinion of Apple UX quality has degraded to the current point of the Tahoe disaster is telling. Several team members paid dearly in emotional abuse under Steve and decided to leave rather than deal with the environment post Steve's death. Stephen is a SJ-era original and should have been able to push hard against what many of us perceive as very poor decisons. He either agreed with those decisions, or did not, and choose to go with the flow and enjoy the benefits of working at Apple. This is fine I guess. Many people are just fine going with the flow and not rocking the boat. It may be even easier when you have Apple-level comp and benefits.My opinon; unless Stephen gets a very strong push from other forces, I don't see that he has the will or fortitude to make the changes that he himself has approved in one way or another. Who will push him? Tim Cook, Craig Federighi, Eddy Cue, Phil Schiller? The perceived mess of Tahoe happened on the watch of all of these Apple leaders.",

          "content": "Cars have similar UX issues as well. See the whole touchscreen saga.It's also an issue on Linux, to an extent. GNOME has a tendency of forcing UIs on users, and Ubuntu with Unity, now GNOME again, etc. Though, thankfully, since the user is free to choose their own desktop environment and window manager, it's not as pressing of an issue.I realized many years ago that simpler UIs deliver the best UX. This is a large reason why I love the command line so much. Most programs have a fixed and stable interface, and can be composed to do what I want. For graphical programs I prefer using a simple window manager like bspwm on X, and niri on Wayland. These don't draw window decorations, and are primarily keyboard-driven, so I don't need superfluous graphics. I only need a simple status bar that shows my workspaces, active window, and some system information. I recently configured it with Quickshell[1], and couldn't be happier. I plan to use this setup for years to come, and it gives me great peace of mind knowing that no company can take that away from me. I will have to maintain it myself, but there shouldn't be any changes in the programs I use to break this in a major way.[1]: https://github.com/imiric/quickshell-niri/tree/main/fancy-ba...",

Scanning is maintained by a single person.Ubuntu 26.04 LTS is expected to be the last version with CUPS v2. CUPS v3 drops current printer driver architecture and introduces proper modern driverless printing with the wrapper for older drivers. Many open-source drivers are already use this wrapper, but expect a huge disarrangement from the users, as none of the proprietary drivers would work out of the box anymore.Do you care about printing?

I value being at the bleeding edge, especially since a large part of the value I bring as a consultant comes from both the breadth and depth of my knowledge of the Unity engine.That’s why I’m currently working on a niche version of the broader VersionAlert idea specifically for Unity, which is why the domain currently redirects to https://versionalert.com/unity\n.The only other service I’ve found that really addresses this need is https://newreleases.io\n. I actually spoke with the very nice husband-and-wife team behind it and even offered to buy the whole project, but their asking price was about 10× higher than what I was offering—which I understand, no hard feelings. I still wish them the best of luck.If anyone is aware of other projects or services in this space, I'd be happy to learn about them and chat.",

The big ideas I'm pursuing is a stackless design running on a flat address space with lightweight processes to minimize message-passing latency, and all the benefits of capabilities so every process is sandboxed and has only access to capabilities they have been explicitly passed via message passing.I've also built a RISC-V emulator to integrate with this platform, so eventually it'll be able to run native binaries written in any language, completely sandboxed, completely built around message-passing. Basically a native, low-level BEAM-like platform to build an entire operating system and user-space.While my day job is writing boring applications, this is the stuff that keeps me awake at night, and I would love so much to talk and write more about this, about the trial-and-errors I'm facing, but it's still so much in flux every week I'm exploring a new approach. Most of my work has been around the stackless scheduler, and I have a plan to achieve preemption for long-running or misbehaved tasks without having to compromise on memory usage (i.e. without giving each process its own stack and allocate memory for context switching).Eventually I'd like to layer on top either Cap'n Proto or another high-performance serialisation system to create a distributed, introspectable environment of object-capabilities that are sending typed messages between each other, achieving the ultimate goal of creating an unholy hybrid between Smalltalk and the Erlang VM.God, how I wish I was paid to work on this type of problems :-)If this sounds close to your area of interests, please send me an email and I’d love to chat.",

We set up Zoho instead of Microsoft or Google Workspace and it’s been very smooth so far (and more cost effective).One fun part of the dev work has been learning all the magic of PostGIS - if you ever have an idea that involves geospatial data or maps, go ahead and try build it with PostGIS in the db.",

But before that, I've taken up designing and building my own shifter and (3) pedals.I printed the main pedal frame and base with PETG, and I found some M5 hardware on amazon for pretty cheap. The pedals use a hall effect sensor to measure the proximity of the pedal to the frame base. They're wired to an esp32 ADC ports and I wrote a simple USB HID device with tinyusb and esp-idf which mounts as a generic game controller - good enough for my case. I saw some designs for a load cell brake pedal, but I wanted to do it as cheaply as possible first, so I found a stiff spring. Big inspiration was cncdan's design.They feel great - I borrowed some old logitech pedals to compare the feel and these are much better!

That might speak to my love of Lua.> Do you think a service like yours with support for many variety of languages a good idea?From a technical perspective, it would be relatively easy to add support for other languages, the biggest problem would be UI and documentation complexity. Each added language would either require a completely seperate set of documentaion or would require the docs to describe everything one layer of abstraction removed from the code people would actually be writing. Both of which would be less than ideal for my goal of extreme simplicity.I think it can be a good idea, but to support something like that _well_ would require a pretty large team of people.I do plan to support some level of 'other languages' for libraries, at a minimum some subset of native Lua libraries (ie. libs written in C). That means it would be possible to find a way to use pretty much any other language interpreter.

Anything as long as I can run on a flat address space and not have to waste countless CPU cycles swapping out page tables every message send. I admit my knowledge of CHERI is superficial and have not spent too much time reading the specs until I can play with off-the-shelf CPUs that support it.Singularity/Midori from MS Research have a lot of good ideas but I feel we don't completely have to compromise forcing a managed environment or language in userspace. I want to run native binaries in this platform, which of course would look a bit different than one is used to (no _entry, no dedicated stack, just a message handler that's called directly by the scheduler, no concept of syscall, just sending messages to a capability)",

The accessibility to run _good_ web services has never been better. If you have a modest budget and an interest, that's enough -- the skill gap is closing. That's good news I think.But Tailscale is the real unlock in my opinion. Having a slot machine cosplaying as sysadmin is cool, but being able to access services securely from anywhere makes them legitimately usable for daily life. It means your services can be used by friends/family if they can get past an app install and login.I also take minor issue with running Vaultwarden in this setup. Password managers are maximally sensitive and hosting that data is not as banal as hosting Plex. Personally, I would want Vaultwarden on something properly isolated and locked down.",

It's become highly consumerist, and seems more like a way of expressing taste/aesthetics than something that's genuinely revolutionary.

The market incorporation/consumerfication of the hobby has been so noticeable in the last five years.

Apple admitted that the cost of training SOTA models is a capex heavy-lift they don't want to own. Seems like they are pivoting to becoming the premium \"last mile\" delivery network for someone else's intelligence. Am I missing the elephant in the room?It's a  smart move.

The first issue is that there is significant momentum in calling Siri bad, so even if Apple released a higher quality version it will still be labelled bad. It can enhance the user's life and make their device easier to use, but the overall press will be cherrypicked examples where it did something silly.2. Basing Siri on Google's Gemini can help to alleviate some of that bad press, since a non-zero share of that doomer commentary comes from brand-loyalists and astroturfing.3. The final issue is that on-device Siri will never perform like server-based ChatGPT. So in a way it's already going to disappoint some users who don't realise that running something on mobile device hardware is going to have compromises which aren't present on a server farm.\nTo help illustrate that point: We even have the likes of John Gruber making stony-faced comparisons between Apple's on-device image generator toy (one that produces about an image per second) versus OpenAI's server farm-based image generator which makes a single image in about 1-2 minutes. So if a long-running tech blogger can't find charity in those technical limitations, I don't expect users to.",

That one knows it has to look in ~/Movies/Astra and it'll do the natural thing of searching for a file named crawl or something and then it'll go do the rest of the work.Likewise, the `modeler` knows to create OpenSCAD files and so on, the `wiki` context knows that I use Mediawiki for my blog and have a Template:HackerNews and how to use it and so on. I find these make doing things a lot easier and, consequently, more fun.All of this data is trusted information: i.e. it's from me so I know I'm not trying to screw myself. My wife is less familiar with the command-line so she doesn't use Claude Code as much as me, and prefers to use ChatGPT the web-app for which we've built a couple of custom GPTs so we can do things together.Claude is such a good model that I really want to give my wife access to it for the stuff she does (she models in Blender).

Probably 30% of the time I use claude code in the terminal it's not actually to write any code.For instance I use claude code to classify my expenses (given a bank statement CSV) for VAT reporting, and fill in the spreadsheet that my accountant sends me. Or for noting down line items for invoices and then generating those invoices at the end of the month. Or even booking a tennis court at a good time given which ones are available (some of the local ones are north/south facing which is a killer in the evening). All these tasks could be done at least as well outside the terminal, but the actual capability exists - and can only exist - on my computer alone.I hope this will interact well with CLAUDE.md and .claude/skills and so forth. I have those files and skills scattered all over my filesystem, so I only have to write the background information for things once. I especially like having claude create CLIs and skills to use those CLIs. Now I only need to know what can be done, rather than how to do it - the “how” is now “ask Claude”.It would be nice to see Cowork support them! (Edit: I see that the article mentions you can use your existing 'connectors' - MCP servers I believe - and that it comes with some skills. I haven't got access yet so I can't say if it can also use my existing skills on my filesystem…)(Follow-up edit: it seems that while you can mount your whole filesystem and so forth in order to use your local skills, it uses a sandboxed shell, so your local commands (for example, tennis-club-cli) aren't available. It seems like the same environment that runs Claude Code on the Web. This limits the use for the moment, in my opinion. Though it certainly makes it a lot safer...)",

          "content": "This sort of blanket judgement on media puts quite a lot of pressure on parents that require an electronic babysitter to function. Sure, it's great when you have a support network and a child who can keep themselves busy, but some of us just need Mrs. Rachel, Caillou, Daniel Tiger, etc to sedate/educate our children while we cook/clean/work/etc.Besides, non-interactive, low-stimulation media with a plot line and simple dialog is not on the same level as giving your child a tablet and letting them have at it.My real concern with this project is the amount of time the builder spent away from his children. Now I get it that some folks(dads on the spectrum?) might feel their best contribution to their child's development stems from something they build in the lab but your children are only young for such a short period and taking time away from them to build a custom electronic solution seems narrowminded and selfish.",

So we could easily be seeing an effect where firms posting these GenAI roles are burning money on the projects in a way that displaces investment in headcount.The point about \"BigTech\" hiring 50% fewer grads is almost orthogonal. All of these companies are shifting hiring towards things where new grads are unlikely to add value, building data centers and frontier work.Moreover the TCJA of 2017 caused software developers to not count for R&D tax write offs (I'm oversimplifying) starting in 2022.

I think it's more likely that they will be roles that already exist in those industries, where the responsibilities include (or at least benefit from) effective use of AI tools.I think the upshot is that more people should probably be learning how to work in some specific domain while learning how to effectively use AI to automate tasks in that domain. (But I also thought this is how the previous iteration of \"learn to code\" should be directed, so maybe I just have a hammer and everything looks like a nail.)I think dedicated \"pure tech\" software where the domain is software rather than some other thing, is more likely to be concentrated in companies building all the infrastructure that is still being built to make this all work.

I don't want to claim the title, but I can certainly claim the imposter syndrome! If anything, LLMs validated something I always suspected. The amount of truly unique, relevant to success, code in a given project is often very small. More often than not, it's not grouped together either. Most of the time it's tailored to a given functionality. For example, a perfectly accurate Haversine distance is slower than an optimized one with tradeoffs. LLMs have not yet become adept at housing the ability to identify the need for those tradeoffs in context well or consistently, so you end up with generic code that works but not great. Can the LLM adjust if you explicitly instruct it to? Sure, sometimes! Sometimes it catches it in a thought loop too. Other times you have to roll up your sleeves and do the work like you said, which often still involves traditional research or thinking.",

Then everybody switched to React.The issue then became, \"What should I learn?\" because at my company (a large fortune 200 company) they were all in on Angular, and weren't looking for React developers, but I knew companies were moving away from Angular. So do I work to get better and more indispensable with Angular, and risk not knowing React? Or do I learn the new shiny framework betting at some point my company will adopt it or I will be laid off and need to know it?It feels like half my life as a dev was spent being a degenerate gambler, always trying to hedge my bets in one way or another, constantly thinking about where everything was going.

I know many people personally struggling to find work as it is right out of school, and many have student loans which exacerbate the situation. For a lot of people, starting from scratch is not realistically feasible in the near future unless they're content with being homeless for a while.Of course labor jobs will always exist, and a 25 year old would (on average) be much more physically able for that than someone older, so it goes both ways.",

Before LLMs, the fraction of low-quality code was growing already, just because it was already profitable.An analogy could be buildings: everybody can build a bench that \"does the job\".

Even if the task itself is somewhat novel, they will break it down in familar ways into familar subtasks/patterns. For sure if a task does require some thinking outside the box, or a novel approach, then the senior developer might have better intuition on what to consider.The major caveat to this is that I'm an old school developer, who started professionally in the early 80's, a time when you basically had to invent everything from scratch, so certainly there is no mental block to having to do so, and I'm aware there is at least a generation of developers that grew up with stack overflow and have much more of a mindset of building stuff using cut an paste, and less having to sit down and write much complex/novel code themselves.2) I think the real distinction of senior vs junior programmers, that will carry over into the AI era, is that senior developers have had enough experience, at increasing levels of complexity, that they know how to architect and work on large complex projects where a more junior developer will flounder. In the AI coding world, at least for time being, until something closer to AGI is achieved (could be 10-20 years away), you still need to be able to plan and architect the project if you want to achieve a result where the outcome isn't just some random \"I let the AI choose everything\" experiment.",

There is an older generation for whom computing was new. 80s through 90s probably being the prime of that era (for people still in the industry). There constantly was a new platform, language, technology, concept to learn. And nobody knew any best practices, nobody knew how anything \"should work\". Nobody knew what anything was capable of. It was all trying things, figuring them out. It was way more trailblazing / exploring new territory. The birth of the internet being one of the last examples of this from that era.The past 10-15 years of software development have been the opposite. Just about everything was evolutionary, rarely revolutionary. Optimizing things for scale, improving libraries, or porting successful ideas from one domain to another. A lot of shifting around deck chairs on things that were fundamentally the same. Just about every new \"advance\" in front-end technology was this. Something hailed as ground breaking really took little exploration, mostly solution space optimization. There was almost always a clear path. Someone always had an answer on stack overflow - you never were \"on your own\". A generation+ grew up in that environment and it felt normal to them.LLMs came about and completely broke that. And people who remembered when tech was new and had potential and nobody knew how to use it loved that. Here is a new alien technology and I get to figure out what makes it tick, how it works how to use it. And on the flip side people who were used to there being a happy path, or a manual to tell you when you were doing it wrong got really frustrated as their being no direction - feeling perpetually lost and it not working the way they wanted.I found it especially ironic being on hacker news how few people seemed to have a hacker mindset when it came to LLMs. So much was, \"I tried something it didn't work so I gave up\". Or \"I just kept telling it to work and it didn't so I gave up\". Explore, pretend you're in a sci-fi movie. Does it work better on \nWednesdays? Does it work better if you stand on your head? Does it work differently if you speak pig-latin? Think side-ways. What behavior can you find about it that makes you go \"hmm, that's interesting...\".Now I think there has been a shift very recently of people getting more comfortable with the tech - but still was surprised of how little of a hacker mindset I saw on hacker news when it came to LLMs.LLMs have reset the playing field from well manicured lawn, to an unexplored wilderness.

      "abstract": "该讨论围绕古代宇航员理论倡导者埃里希·冯·丹尼肯的逝世展开。核心话题聚焦于对其作品影响的评价，以及关于古代文明成就来源的长期争议。\n\n有人认为冯·丹尼肯的作品虽缺乏科学依据，但以其叙事魅力激发了年轻读者对考古与神秘现象的兴趣。也有用户指出其理论并非原创，早在《众神之车》出版前已有类似作品流行。讨论中提到，部分用户批评其理论低估了古代人类的独立创造能力，认为许多被归为“外星遗迹”的成就完全可能在人类技术发展中快速出现并被遗忘。\n\n社区共识在于普遍认同其作品属于科幻娱乐范畴而非科学论述，且对青少年具有较强吸引力。主要分歧体现在对其遗产的评价：一方强调其作为“伟大写作者”的娱乐价值，另一方则谴责其传播虚假信息对公众认知的误导。此外，有用户从媒体传播角度赞赏其作品的市场适应性，同时有德语用户回忆其理论在1970年代德国甚至曾获部分成年人认真对待的现象。",

Years before \"Chariots of the Gods\", Peter Kolosimo already had best-selling works discussing ancient aliens.https://rationalwiki.org/wiki/Ancient_astronauts\"However, the fifties and sixties were more dominated by European works. The Italian Peter Kolosimo wrote several books as early as 1957, but his Timeless Earth (1964) became an international best seller and was translated into several languages. French-language authors included Henri Lhote who proposed that prehistoric Saharan rock art depicted close encounters, Bergier and Pauwels' Morning of the Magicians (1960), Robert Charroux's One Hundred Thousand Years of Man's Unknown History (1963) and Misraki's Flying Saucers Through The Ages. A few British authors also published before Von Däniken, such as Brinsley Le Poer Trench, John Michell and W. Raymond Drake who wrote Gods or Spacemen? in 1964.\"Although Von Däniken claims he was formulating his ancient astronaut ideas throughout his school days, it is clear that many others had already published their books on the subject, long before he became notable with Chariots of the Gods? in 1968.\"",

IIRC, different wings of the park were dedicated to different mysteries/monuments, so you'd have the Aztec and Egyptian pyramids, Peruvian (Nazca, and my favorite one) desert drawings, ancient Indian flying chariots, etc. A great time, and I'm honestly quite surprised (in retrospect) that my dad chose to go there, given our time-limited schedule. It was also my first time trying Weisswurst in the JP cafetaria (being a Hindu kid growing up in the UAE, I seized every opportunity to try beef and pork when I could lol) -- I'm sure it was fairly mid, but I thought it was fantastic!If nothing else, it helped me establish some pop cultural 'throughlines' in that I was able to digest (so to speak) other \"aliens were here first and they taught us a bunch of things\" trope that cropped up later in my life (like Aliens vs. Predators, Prometheus). I can't say for sure, but it might have been my earliest encounter with the Big Question: \"Why are we here? Is there a plan?\" -- even though I discounted the alien theory pretty young, it was still an exciting way to get started on the subject (and is still fun to me to this day). I suppose a portion of credit for ongoing interest in science fiction is directly attributable to my time at Jungfrau Park :)Weirdly enough, I was just in Switzerland a couple of months back and we happened to drive by Jungfrau on our way to Lauterbrunnen -- JP is still there, which stirred up the ^ memory, but I learned on the trip that it had been shut down sadly.Thanks for being a part of such a surreal memory Mr. Daniken.",

I remember reading it probably in the early '70s, when I would have been somewhere in the 10-12 year old range. I'm pretty sure I believed he was probably right, as did a couple friends who also read it.We also believed in some other bunk, like various psychic and paranormal stuff, much of which came from reading \"Fate\" magazine.But without internet there was really no way to connect with a larger community of people who also believed those things. With just books, magazines, and maybe if we were really into it a couple newsletters it was hard to become obsessed with this stuff.Furthermore we also read popular science magazines, and Asimov's monthly column in \"The Magazine of Fantasy & Science Fiction\". They would publish rebuttals to the more significant crackpot claims going around (although I don't think Asimov ever specifically commented on EvD). The mainstream news magazines, like Time or Newsweek, would often include comments by prominent skeptics such as Carl Sagan when writing about these things.Because mass communication was expensive (and often also slow) new questionable theories took some time to start getting widespread acceptance. That gave scientists (or other relevant experts for non-science based crackpot theories) time to write refutations. It is more work (often much more work) to refute crackpots than it is to generate crackpot theories.Now we are awash with widespread belief in crackpot theories. A new one can spread very fast and very wide on social media and be established before refutations can be written. And when the refutations do come out the social media algorithms might not show them to the people that those same algorithms fed the theories to. They get more clicks and engagement if they instead show those people new crackpot theories instead of refutations of the crackpot theories they were showing a week or two earlier.",

The main thing I realized from arguing about it with them was that rigor and science did not really matter and would not convince them of anything. It's an emotional and spiritual belief for them - a way for them to rationalize how humans went from mud to computers. They don't believe in human creativity being powerful enough to lead to modern society and think an external force was required. Ancient aliens is a convenient and fun theory for how it could have happened.",

Also, if there are better explanations - old ones are thrown out as well, because that is how it is in science.

Albums, Live Photos (paired assets), bursts, slo-mo, edits, and even “simple” things like adjusted capture dates are all tracked separately, and most export/backup tools end up flattening or partially reconstructing that on restore.The approach I took was to treat Photos as the source of truth and verify restored items against it, rather than assuming filesystem metadata is enough.

My compromise is simple:- I use docker-icloudpd to download our iCloud Photos to local storage over time. It’s been the most practical way I’ve found to back up multiple accounts into one place, though it does require occasional re-auth every so often.\n- I keep only the last ~2 years of media in iCloud and delete older ones after they’re archived locally.\n- For browsing and searching the older archive, I use Immich, which has been a great self-hosted personal photo cloud experience with a modern app feel.For storage, I’ve found fast local disk matters a lot once you’re digging up photos from 5+ years ago.

Closed tags allow editors like Vim or automated tools to handle the source code easier; e.g. I can type `dit` in Vim to delete the contents of a tag, something that's only possible because the tag's content is clearly delimited. It makes parsing HTML easier because there are fewer syntax rules.I learned HTML quite late, when HTML 5 was already all the rage, and I never understood why the more strict rules of XML for HTML never took off. They seem so much saner than whatever soup of special rules and exceptions we currently have. HTML 5 was an opportunity to make a clear cut between legacy HTML and the future of HTML. Even though I don't have to, I strive to adhere to the stricter rules of closing all tags, closing self-closing tags and only using lower-case tag names.",

The idea was to impose XML’s strict parsing rules: well-formed documents only, close all your tags, lowercase element names, quote all attributes, and if the document is malformed, the parser must stop and display an error rather than guess. XHTML was abandoned in 2009.\nWhen HTML5 was being drafted in 2004-onwards, the WHATWG actually had to formally specify how browsers should handle malformed markup, essentially codifying IE’s error-recovery heuristics as the standard.",

And then you'll understand why I'm not going to even begin to attempt to answer your question about how browsers handle various tag combinations. Instead my point is only that, with HTML5, there is in fact a very concrete answer that is no longer up to the browsers trying to each individually spackle over the various and sundry gaps in the standards.But honestly no answer to \"what does the browser do with this sort of thing\" fits into an HN comment anymore.

Browsers choose to go with the “render anyway” approach, but this lead to different outputs in different browsers, since it wasn’t agreed upon how to render invald html.The difference between Netscape and IE was that Netscape in more cases would skip rendering invalid HTML, where IE would always render the content.",

Something is almost certainly disintegrating your cable.  If you have any spare old pvc pipe or something in the basement, hit it with a hammer and see if it is brittle (the hammer should  bounce). If it is brittle, I would not hang out in the basement until you figure out what is going on.One random guess other than gases of various sorts:  If you have the lights on a lot, it's possible you have lighting that is not properly uv filtered somehow.(It theoretically could be lots of heat/humidity vs certain types of cable jackets, but that would be obviously noticeable most of the time)The fiber and even the armor itself looks fine in your pictures and I bet the error rate is zero.  Outside of bending, i can't see how you could damage the fiber when the armor is in perfect shape.  That armor will unravel if you really damaged it.  The speed thing is not how fiber works.  It's hard to get marginal link enough to generate retries that degrade your speed by 10%.  Most of the time either you have full speed link, no link, or so many errors speed is zero.  The optics almost always have rx/TX signal strength DDM you can look atAlso did you say you direct buried it in cement?  If so it's not rated for that.  Direct burial and concrete tight/safe are not the same thing at all, not the least of reasons being concrete is highly alkaline (ph12-13) when poured",

Currently the hypotheses for why the cable disintegrated so quickly is hydrolysis and paint solvents. Singapore is extremely humid but this doesn't explain why the exposed cabling on the other end is still healthy and not crumbly.The second possibility is that I keep the leftover wall paints (Nippon Paint Vinilex 5000) in the same room and have noticed that much of the solvents have evaporated. It is possible that the solvents in the air might have caused the cable to fail in 3 years. It would explain why the other ends that aren't exposed to the air inside the bomb shelter aren't falling apart.Some other learnings from this. Buried cabling should always be permanently fixed and attached to a patch panel instead of dangling in the open. That was the original plan but I figured it wouldn’t be an issue. I was wrong. Always measure exact length of buried fibre cabling as they aren’t meant to be stored in loops.",

Anthropic is protecting its huge asset: the Claude Code value chain, which has proven itself to be a winner among devs (me included, after trying everything under the sun in 2025). If anything, Anthropic's mistake is that they are incapable of monetizing their great models in the chat market, where ChatGPT reigns: ie. Anthropic did not invest in image generation, Google did and Gemini has a shot at the market now.Apparently nobody gets the Anthropic move: they are only good at coding and that's a very thin layer. Opencode and other tools are game for collecting inputs and outputs that can later be used to train their own models - not necessarily being done now, but they could - Cursor did it. Also Opencode makes it all easily swappable, just eval something by popping another API key and let's see if Codex or GLM can replicate the CC solution. Oh, it does! So let's cancel Claude and save big bucks!Even though CC the agent supports external providers (via the ANTHROPIC_BASE_URL env var), they are working hard on making it impossible for other models to support their every increasing agent feature set (skills, teleport and remote sessions, LSP, Chrome integration, etc).

These businesses both have their problems, but blocking third-party apps doesn’t seem to be one of them.I think Anthropic took a look at the market, realized they had a strong position with Claude Code, and decided to capitalize on that rather than joining the race to the bottom and becoming just another option for OpenCode.  OpenAI looked at the market and decided the opposite, because they don’t have strong market share with Codex and they would rather undercut Claude, which is a legitimate strategy. Don’t know who wins.I feel like Anthropic is probably making the right choice here. What do they have to gain by helping competitors undercut them?

The idea of there being escape hatch made me less concerned about vendor lock-in and encouraged me to a) get my entire team onto CC and b) invest time into building CC's flavor of agents, skills, commands, hooks, etc., as well as setting up a marketplace to distribute them internally.While Anthropic was within their right to enforce their ToS, the move has changed my perspective. In the language of moats and lock-ins, it all makes sense, sure, but as a potential sign of the shape of things to come, it has hurt my trust in CC as something I want to build on top of.Yesterday, I finally installed OpenCode and tried it. It feels genuinely more polished, and the results were satisfactory.So while this is all very anecdotal, here's what Anthropic accomplished:1) I no longer feel like evangelizing for their tool\n2) I installed a competitor and validated it's as good as others are claiming.Perhaps I'm overly dramatic, but I can't imagine I'm the only one who has responded this way.",

I don't like it either but this is pretty standard stuff and it's obvious why they're doing it.Claude, ChatGPT, Gemini, and Grok are all more or less on par with each other, or a couple months behind at most. Chinese open models are also not far behind.There's nothing inherent to these products to make them \"sticky\". If your tooling is designed for it, you can trivially switch models at any time. Mid-conversation, even. And it just works.When you have basically equivalent products with no switching cost, you have perfect competition. They are all commodities. And that means: none of them can make a profit. It's a basic law of economics.If they can't make a profit, no matter how revolutionary the tech is, their valuation is not justified, and they will be in big trouble when people figure this out.So they need to make the product sticky somehow. So they:1. Add a subscription payment model. Once you are paying a subscription fee, then the calculus on switching changes: if you only maintain one subscription, you have a strong reason to stick with it for everything.2. Force you to use their client app, which only talks to their model, so you can't even try other models without changing your whole workflow, which most people won't bother to do.These are bog standard tactics across the tech industry and beyond for limiting competitive pressure.Everyone is mad about #2 but honestly I'm more mad about #1. The best thing for consumers would be if all these model providers strictly provided usage-based API pricing, which makes switching easy. But right now the subscription prices offer an enormous discount over API pricing, which just shows how much they are really desperate to create some sort of stickiness. The subscriptions don't even provide the \"peace of mind\" benefit that Spotify-like subscription models provide, where you don't have to worry about usage, because they still have enforced usage limits that people regularly hit. It's just purely a discount offered for locking yourself in.But again I can't really be that mad because of course they are doing this, not doing it would be terrible business strategy.",

Anthropic is probably still losing money on subscribers, so other companies \"reselling\" their offering does them no good. Forcing you to use their TUI at least gives them control of how you interact with the models back. I'm guessing but since they've gone full send into the developer tooling space, their pitch to investors likely highlights the # of users on CC, not their subscriber numbers (which again, lose money).

And it's the thing I can't stand with regular non-zero coke (well the sugar level too, but that's pure health thing).It would also be very interesting if he could get his hands on coke from different markets as the formulation varies from country to country. One of the most obvious is the amount of cinnamon, but it would be very interesting to know if more differences were there.Another interrogation of mine would be if, sugar aside, the formula is different between regular coke and coke zero. I'd bet is is, simply to offset the aftertaste that aspartam/artificial sweeteners have, but I'm curious if other non-sweetness related ingredients do change.",

The bottling processing factory will also impart a taste, as will the local humidity which is why I often think drinks taste odd in Singapore.My fav thing I heard was back in a chemistry lab someone told me a rumour coke had invested serious R&D into a plastic/surface that tastes like lemon to accommodate for the regular plastic taste that leaches from their bottles.",

I’m not really aware of what everyone else is doing with sandboxes etc.But the bit at the end with the MDM server made it click for me. I’ve started generating tiny iOS apps for personal software stuff, because they solve data storage better than the web (at least on iOS). A database on some other server seems like a bad fit/overkill for this stuff, client side storage is too flaky because Safari. But iOS apps are limiting in their own annoying ways compared to web apps.This looks like a really interesting solution, I can just store the data on a sprite with SQLite or whatever. Visit its URL to use my app, then does it go away on its own after a short time? I could have done that before with a server with storage, but this seems easier/probably cheaper.If this works well/the way I’m hoping it might be the sweet spot for simple personal software that needs persistent data and you want to run anywhere.One feature that would make this really nice is if it could have something like Vercel preview environments, where I need to auth my fly account to view the URL. That'd solve the public URL without me needing to do my own auth thing in every app.",

I love fly-replay combined with super fast start-up.I've been thinking a lot about how to run agents (and skills) securely while giving them a lot of powerful capabilities.I recently used their macaroons library to turn arbitrary API keys (e.g. for stripe's API) into macaroons. I route requests for an upstream host (like stripe) through Envoy as a mitm proxy which injects the real creds after verifying the macaroon.It is such a powerful pattern. I'm always worried about leaking sensitive keys through prompt injection attacks (or just sending them to anthropic), but in this model you can attenuate the keys (both capabilities & validity window) client side. The Envoy proxy lives inside my flycast network so it can't be accessed externally.It would be so cool if fly built something like this into sprites.dev (though I can see how it would be spooky to have fly install their own certs for stripe, etc...)",

I think you could use TestFlight, which is Apple's method for distributing an unreleased version of an app, but I'm not sure what the review process would look like for that. Android would be much easier as long as you can still sideload APKs, you could just build the APK and send it to everyone to install. I read that there were some changes to sideloading APKs but I don't know the details.In terms of actually making the app, I don't know Swift or iOS at all so it's all generated. Usual caveats, and I'm only running them on my own phone. I ask Claude (not code) to help me with the spec, I give it some bullet points and it asks a bunch of clarifying questions then gives me a spec. I put that in a new directory, fire up Claude and use the ralph-loop plugin (https://github.com/anthropics/claude-code/tree/main/plugins/...):> /ralph-loop:ralph-loop \"Implement the iOS app described in app-spec.md.

It was technically correct, aesthetically pure but socially rejected because it was too stark for the general public (my opinion).This implementation gets one thing most Metro clones miss, i.e the typography as structure paradigm. In Win8, there were no divider lines or heavy drop shadows to denote hierarchy. The hierarchy was defined strictly by the weight and size of the font.We spent the last decade drifting back into glassmorphism and mica materials (win11) because people missed the comfort of texture but from a pure information density and rendering performance perspective - the flat, monochromatic 2D plane of windows 8 is a nice tangent. It removed the cognitive load of decoding the UI chrome for touch users.ps: I'm impressed by the constraint of using native Qt/C++ here instead of taking the easy route with electron or QML/javascript bindings for everything.",

On iPhone almost every app needs a Share button somewhere and almost every app still has it in a different place today. On Windows Phone 8 it was much more obvious why a dedicated OS-level Share button accessible just about anywhere in any app was pretty great. On Desktop it wasn't seen as helpful as almost no apps supported it (either as shareable things or as apps that could be shared to) because there was no easy Win32 bridge and Microsoft also didn't think to try to integrate with clipboard operations until too late in Windows 8.1 (and then never quite delivered it because most everyone had already written off the Charms by then), as what could have been a potentially easy path to use the existing Windows \"share paradigm\" to bootstrap.(You can make cases for the other 4 Charms as well beyond the Share charm, but the Share charm is the most obvious where Windows Phone proved it was a good idea but the Desktop didn't have enough supporting apps to also prove it there.)",

But a full install from a stage3 on my ageing Thinkpad X13 or SBCs would fry the poor things and just isn't feasible to maintain.I have systemd-nspawn containers for the different microarchitectures and mount their /var/cache/binpkgs and /etc/portage dirs over NFS on the target machines.

          "content": "For me, the most underrated takeaway here is the state of RISC-V support.While other distributions are struggling to bootstrap their package repositories for new ISAs and waiting for build farms to catch up, Gentoo's source based nature makes it architecture agnostic by definition. I applaud the risque team for having achieved parity with amd64 for the @system set. This proves that the meta-distribution model is the only scalable way to handle the explosion of hardware diversity we are seeing post 2025. If you are building an embedded platfrm or working on custom silicon, Gentoo is a top tier choice. You cross-compile the stage1 and portage handles the rest.",

It remains one of the fastest distros I've seen for the specific hardware it was running on (high core count 4-socket AMD opteron servers) and I mostly attributed that to the fact it was compiling everything (even the base os in this case!) for that specific CPU at install time... emerge would build/compile and if you set your USE flags correctly it produced heavily tailored and optimized binaries.  I feel like a staged/graduated (downloading/running precompiled initially while a flag-optimized compile runs in the background) would be a good way to get around some of the downsides here (namely that it takes 45 minutes to install firefox with emerge/pacman and that builds fail more often than packages fail to install).Very cool to see that it's still going strong - I remember managing many machines at scale was a bit of a challenge, especially keeping ahead of vulnerabilities.",

Don't have to mess with repos.conf either because portage will look to /var/cache/binpkgs by default.make.conf is a directory on both machines and has files like 01-common-flags.conf and 02-binhost-flags.conf. The Thinkpad has 01-common-flags.conf and 03-target-flags.conf with EMERGE_DEFAULT_OPTS=\"--with-bdeps=n --usepkgonly\" set, so running emerge -avuDN on the Thinkpad will only update with binaries from the mounted /var/cache/binpkgs. I keep the software in sync by using /etc/portage/sets instead of the world file. Then all the package.* dirs are symlinks as well.The Thinkpad binhost is a znver3, so the build container has CFLAGS=\"--march=x86-64-v3 --mtune=alderlake\" set. There's some SIMD extensions that two don't have in common and it has to build code that runs on both machines, otherwise you could use the target architecture in --march. Using the --mtune option in my case apparently sets the L2 cache size of the produced code to that of the Intel chip.Systemd-nspawn containers are super easy to spin up, as you basically install Gentoo from stage3 and it works like a chroot but with a full init.

While the binary distributions were wrestling with the logistical nightmare of splitting repositories and figuring out the /lib64 vs /lib standard, Gentoo users just changed their CHOST, bootstrapped and were running 64-bit native. You nailed the psychology of it, too. The speed marketing was always a bit of a red herring. The ability to say \"I do not want LDAP support in my mail client\" and have the package manager actually respect that is cool. It respects the user's intelligence rather than abstracting it away.Since you've been on the ride since '04, I'm curious to hear your thoughts. How do you feel the maintenance burden compares today versus the GCC 3.x era? With the modern binhost fallback and the improvements in portage, I feel like we now spend less time fighting rebuild loops than back then? But I wonder if long time users feel the same.",

          "content": "TLDR: Installation is a pain, initial configuration is a pain and there's always something more to tweak, update is a lesser pain, but still a pain. But it's fun, BDSM-style...Installation is done by booting a liveCD, manually partitioning your storage, unpacking a Gentoo STAGE3 archive, chrooting in it, doing basic configuration such as network, timezone, portage (package manager) base profile and servers, etc., compiling and installing a kernel and then rebooting into the new system.Then you get to play with /etc/portage/make.conf which is the root configuration of the package manager. You get to set CPU instruction sets (CPU_FLAGS), gcc CFLAGS flags, MAKE flags, video card targets, acceptable package licenses, global USE flags (those are simplified ./configure arguments that usually apply to several packages), which Apache modules get built, which qemu targets get built, etc. These are all env vars that portage (the package manager) uses to build packages for your system.The more you use Gentoo, the more features of make.conf you discover. Never ending fun.Then, you start installing packages and updates (same procedure):1) You start the update by reviewing USE flags for each added/updated package - several screens of dense text.For example, PHP has these USE flags: https://packages.gentoo.org/packages/dev-lang/php - mouse hover to see what they do. You get to play with them in /etc/portage/package.use and there's no end to tweaking them.If you have any form of OCD, stay away from Gentoo or this will be your poison forever!2) Then the compilation begins and that takes hours or days depending on what you install and uses a lot of CPU and either storage I/O or memory (if you have lots of memory, you can compile in a tmpfs a lot faster).I'm not sure it is OK to compile the updates on a live server, especially during busy hours, but Gentoo has alternatives, including binary packages (recently added, but must match your USE flags with theirs), building packages remotely on another system (distcc), even on a different arch (crossdev). You could run an ARM server and build packages for it on a x86 workstation. I didn't use \"steve\", so I can't tell you what wonderful things that tool can do, yet.3) Depending on architecture, some less used packages may fail to compile. You get to manually debug that and submit bug reports. You can also add patches to /etc/portage/patches/<package> that will automatically be applied when the package is built, and that includes the kernel.I recommend you to run emerge with --keep-going to have the package manager continue after an error with the remaining packages.4) When each package is done compiling, it's installed automatically. There are no automatic reboots or anything. The files are replaced live, both executables and libraries. Running services continue to use old files from memory until you restart them or reboot manually - they will appear red/yellow in htop until you do.There were a few times, very very few, when I had crashes in new packages that were succesfuly built. It only happened on armv7, which is a practically abandoned platform everywhere. In those cases you can revert to the old ones and mask the bugged version to prevent it from being updated to next time.5) Last step is to review the config changes. dispatch-conf will present a diff of all proposed changes to .ini and .cfg files for all updated packages. You get to review, accept, reject the changes or manually edit the files.That's all. Simple. :)",

The team setting international rates probably doesn't talk to whoever monitors small parcel economics.The author mentions making a few hundred dollars - but the real question is scalability.

      "abstract": "该帖子讨论了Lightpanda项目将其DOM实现迁移至Zig语言的决定。核心话题围绕Zig在浏览器引擎组件开发中的应用，以及与其他语言如Rust、C++的对比。有人认为Zig的选择令人振奋，展示了其在系统编程领域的潜力，也有用户指出Zig尚未发布1.0版本且存在不向后兼容的IO变更，用于生产代码需谨慎。讨论中提到，项目创始人解释选择Zig是因目标为构建无头浏览器而非通用浏览器，且Zig更简洁高效。部分用户对Zig的实践效果表示肯定，认为其优于传统工具。然而，社区中存在分歧：一方支持Zig的轻量与创新，另一方则质疑其成熟度，并指出每当Zig相关帖子出现时，常引发与Rust支持者的争论。共识在于，多数用户认可该项目在技术探索上的价值，但对语言选择的风险看法不一。",

          "content": "This reminds me of the Servo project's journey. Always impressed to see another implementation of the WHATWG specs.It's interesting to see Zig being chosen here over Rust for a browser engine component. Rust has kind of become the default answer for \"safe browser components\" (e.g., Servo, Firefox's oxidation), primarily because the borrow checker maps so well to the ownership model of a DOM tree in theory. But in practice, DOM nodes often need shared mutable state (parent pointers, child pointers, event listeners), which forces you into Rc<RefCell<T>> hell in Rust.Zig's manual memory management might actually be more ergonomic for a DOM implementation specifically because you can model the graph relationships more directly without fighting the compiler, provided you have a robust strategy for the arena allocation. Excited to learn from Lightpanda's implementation when it's out.",

          "content_cn": "这让我想起了Servo项目的发展历程。每次看到WHATWG规范的另一种实现都令人印象深刻。有趣的是，这里选择用Zig而非Rust开发浏览器引擎组件。Rust几乎已成为\"安全浏览器组件\"的默认选择（例如Servo、Firefox的氧化项目），主要是因为借用检查器在理论上能完美映射DOM树的所有权模型。但实际上，DOM节点常需要共享可变状态（父指针、子指针、事件监听器），这在Rust中会迫使开发者陷入Rc<RefCell<T>>的困境。\n\n对于DOM实现而言，Zig的手动内存管理可能反而更符合人体工程学——只要建立完善的内存池分配策略，就能直接建模图形关系而无需与编译器对抗。期待Lightpanda实现方案发布后能从中汲取经验。"

The example from the article is:  // Unless, of course, you separate the year, month, and date with hyphens.\n  // Then it gets the _day_ wrong.\n  console.log( new Date('2026-01-02') );\n  // Result: Date Thu Jan 01 2026 19:00:00 GMT-0500 (Eastern Standard Time)\n\nIn this example, the day is \"wrong\" because the constructor input is being interpreted as midnight UTC on January 2nd, and at that instantaneous point in time, it is 7pm on January 1st in Eastern Standard Time (which is the author's local time zone).What's actually happening here is a comedy of errors. JavaScript is interpreting that particular string format (\"YYYY-MM-DD\") as an ISO 8601 date-only form. ISO 8601 specifies that if no time zone designator is provided, the time is assumed to be in local time. The ES5 spec authors intended to match ISO 8601 behavior, but somehow accidentally changed this to 'The value of an absent time zone offset is “Z”' (UTC).Years later, they had realized their mistakes, and attempted to correct it in ES2015. And you can probably predict what happened. When browsers shipped the correct behavior, they got too many reports about websites which were relying on the previous incorrect behavior. So it got completely rolled back, sacrificed to the altar of \"web compatibility.\"For more info, see the \"Broken Parser\" section towards the bottom of this article:https://maggiepint.com/2017/04/11/fixing-javascript-date-web...",

Old Date code gets the old Date code quirks, new code gets the nice new Temporal API.Internal modules would be handy in theory to maybe keep from having to dig through a thesaurus every time browsers decide to add a new, stricter version of an older API. Internal modules have even been proposed to TC-39 as a recommended way to continue to expand the JS API. Last I checked on that proposal it was stuck behind several concerns including:1. Feature detection: detecting if Temporal available is as easy as `if ('Temporal' in globalThis) {}`, but detecting if a module import is missing is a bit harder. Right now the standard is that loading a module fails with an Error if one of its imports fails. You can work around that by doing a dynamic import inside a try/catch, but that's a lot of extra boilerplate compared to `const thingINeed = 'someApi' in globalThis ? someApi() : someApiPolyfill()`. I've seen  multiple proposals on that front from extensions to import maps and `with { }` options on the import itself.2. Bikeshedding (and lots of it): defining a URI scheme like `browser:` or `standard:` takes a bunch of thought on how you expand it. If it is just `browser:some-api` you run the risk of eventually polluting all the easy names in the exact way people worry about the risk of over-polluting `globalThis` (and in the way that it can be weirdly hard to find an available one-word name on npm), you've just moved the naming problem from one place to the other. On the other side, if you go down the road of something like `es-standard:https://tc39.es/ecma262/2025/v1/final-draft/Temporal`, even (especially) assuming users would mostly importmap that to something shorter you've recreated XMLNS URIs in a funny new hat and people who use JS all certainly have plenty of opinions on XMLNS URIs, many are very vocal in their hatred of it, but also they came out of a strong backwards incompatibility fixing desire exactly like this.

If there is ever a DateTime string in a Date column in the database, it's impossible to know what the date was supposed to be unless you know you normalized it at some point on the way up.Then I found that a lot of DatePicker libraries, despite being in \"DATE\" picker mode, will still append a local timezone to its value.

For a classical alpha-beta search based engine, for a given ply (turn) you might have ~20 moves to consider each depth of the search tree. If you're trying to brute force search deeper, a 10x increase in compute time or power doesn't even let you search an extra ply.Elo gains for engines tend to come from better evaluation, better pruning, and better search heuristics. That's not to say that longer search time or a stronger CPU doesn't help, it just doesn't magically make a weak engine into a strong engine.",

Which, arguably, should not happen:    var f = fopen(\"file.txt\", \"r\");\n    defer fclose(f);\n\n    if fread(&ch, 1, 1, f) <= 0 { return -1; }\n    return 0;\n\nwould not close file if it was empty.

They had to 3D print their own solder paste squeegee. They're six months in and still trying to produce one simple board.I've been down this road of populating a surface mount board. There is a minimum size for a practical board-stuffing operation, and they are below it. They are using prototype techniques for 100 units or so, not techniques that scale.Surface mount soldering requires applying hot air in a very controlled way, with the temperature ramping up, holding at the high temp for a few seconds, and then ramping down. On a small scale, you have a programmable oven which tries to do that. Those always have heat distribution problems. For production, you have a tunnel oven, with about six sections at different temperatures and a chain conveyor to take the boards through the tunnel. With the tunnel oven, you let the whole thing warm up and stabilize, and when all zones are at the right temperature, you can repeatably solder boards successfully.They're using a hobbyist-grade pick and place machine. Slow, but cheap. Plus the software isn't ready for prime time. They looked at a used production machine. Runs Windows XP and wouldn't fit through the door. Rejected that.They're about EUR 30,000 into this, not counting their own labor.\nThis approach is not going to revive electronics in Europe.",

But by making an effort to give people who are starting a good experience, we can turn this around.Honestly there is no worker shortage, in my immediate contacts, I already know 2 or 3 people who are ready to work my production line: They have the smarts, skills, and time.

A newspaper publishing the name/image of a suspected criminal is definitely \"publishing an individuals name, photograph\", without their consent, and can quite clearly cause alarm or distress.Without some exemption clauses added, this bill seems to basically ban using anyone's name/photograph/likeness in ANY context that criticises them; it will almost certainly conflict with ECHR's Article 10 on freedom of expression.\nHowever(!!) with a few exemptions it can be made much better. Even tying it to AI generated photos/voice/etc would help - most _genuine_ criticism and reporting can go without the use of AI, but a lot of the intentional harm and sexual harassment did not occur before AI.

All you do is wave the batton, no need to ever play a instrument. If LLMs are doing the hard part (writing code) then we can be the conductor waving the batton.But of course the visuals are misleading. Being conductor doesn't take the least skill, it takes the most. He hears every instrument individually, he knows the piece intimately, and through his conducting brings a unique expression to a familiar work.LLMs have made the musician part automated. They'll play whatever you want. No doubt a powerful tool in the hands of a skilled conductor. And a incredible tool for someone who can't play to generate music for themselves.There's no shortage of \"I built it and they won't come\" posts here on HN, predating LLMs by decades. Because code has never been the hard part of \"software as a business \". LLMs have driven this point home. Code has never been cheaper. Business has never been harder.",

We’re Will and Jorge, and we’ve built LAD (Language-Aided Design), a SolidWorks add-in that uses LLMs to create sketches, features, assemblies, and macros from conversational inputs (https://www.trylad.com/).We come from software engineering backgrounds where tools like Claude Code and Cursor have come to dominate, but when poking around CAD systems a few months back we realized there's no way to go from a text prompt input to a modeling output in any of the major CAD systems. In our testing, the LLMs aren't as good at making 3D objects as they are are writing code, but we think they'll get a lot better in the upcoming months and years.To bridge this gap, we've created LAD, an add-in in SolidWorks to turn conversational input and uploaded documents/images into parts, assemblies, and macros. It includes:- Dozens of tools the LLM can call to create sketches, features, and other objects in parts.- Assembly tools the LLM can call to turn parts into assemblies.- File system tools the LLM can use to create, save, search, and read SolidWorks files and documentation.- Macro writing/running tools plus a SolidWorks API documentation search so the LLM can use macros.- Automatic screenshots and feature tree parsing to provide the LLM context on the current state.- Checkpointing to roll back unwanted edits and permissioning to determine which commands wait for user permission.You can try LAD at https://www.trylad.com/ and let us know what features would make it more useful for your work. To be honest, the LLMs aren't great at CAD right now, but we're mostly curious to hear if people would want and use this if it worked well.",

      "abstract": "该HackerNews帖子讨论了AI在SolidWorks等CAD软件中的应用前景，核心话题是开发者推出的LAD插件如何通过自然语言输入生成草图、特征和装配体。社区讨论呈现多元观点。\n\n有人认为AI在3D建模领域潜力巨大，但质疑文本交互的适用性，指出当前大语言模型对三维空间的理解仍不足。也有用户指出，文本输入的困难反映了更深层问题：多数人缺乏空间思维能力，且不熟悉专业建模术语，这加剧了沟通障碍。\n\n讨论中提到，部分用户对AI处理技术图纸和数据表的能力表示怀疑，认为需先提升AI理解技术文档的可靠性，才能期待其生成精确的CAD模型。另有用户提及已有类似技术（如SGS-1）采用更专业的B-rep生成方法，可能优于纯文本驱动方案。\n\n共识方面，许多用户认同当前AI在执行精确CAD操作（如空间推理、拉伸/倒角决策）时错误率较高，实现可靠应用仍面临挑战。分歧则体现在技术路径上：部分用户主张垂直整合所有CAD平台以降低风险，另有用户推荐结合代码生成与实时渲染（如Replicad）的工作流作为替代方案。同时，用户对SolidWorks软件本身的易用性和教程维护问题也表达了不满。",

For example, someone might describe a creating a tube is fairly ambiguous language, even though they can see it in their head: \"Draw a circle and go up 100mm, 5mm thick\" as opposed to \"Place a circle on the XY plane, offset the circle by 5mm, and extrude 100mm in the z-plane\"",

There has definitely been a step change in Opus 4.5; I first had it first reverse engineer the Altium file format using a Ghidra MCP and was impressed and how well it worked with decompiled Delphi. Gemini 3 Pro/Flash also make a huge difference with data extraction from PDFs like foot prints or mechanical drawings so we're close to closing the whole loop on several different fields, not just with software engineering.For the most part they still suck at anything resembling real spatial reasoning but they're capable of doing incredibly monotonous things that most people wouldn't put themselves through like meticulously labeling every pin or putting strict design rule checks on each net or setting up DSN files for autorouter. It even makes the hard routing quite easy because it can set up the DRC using the Saturn calculator so I don't have to deal with that.If you give them a natural language interface [1] (a CLI in a claude skill, thats it) that you can translate to concrete actions, coordinates, etc. it shines. Opus can prioritize nets for manual vs autorouting, place the major components using language like \"middle of board\" which I then use another LLM to translate to concrete steps, and just in general do a lot of the annoying things I used to have to do. You can even combine the visual understanding of Gemini with the actions generated by Opus to take it a step further, by having the latter generate instructions and the former generates JSON DSL to that gets executed.I'm really curious what the defensibility of all these businesses is going to be going forward. I have no plans on entering that business but my limit at this point is I'm not willing to pay more than $200/mo for several Max plans to have dozens of agents running all the time. When it only takes an hour to create a harness that allows Claude to go hog wild with desktop apps there is a LOT of unexplored space but just about anyone who can torrent Solidworks or Altium can figure it out. On the other hand, if it's just a bunch of people bootstrapping, they won't have the same pressure to grow.Good luck![1] Stuff like \"place U1 to the left of U4, 50mm away\" and the CLI translates that to structured data with absolute coordinates on the PCB. Having the LLM spit out natural language and then using another LLM with structured outputs to translate that to a JSON DSL works very well, including when you need Opus to do stuff like click on screen.",

Haven't done much with Altium but it seems like you get at least somewhat of a boost for it being slightly more about the logic and less about the spatial reasoning.2 things related to what you said I hadn't put in the original post:1. In our experience, the LLMs were awful at taking actions directly with any of the SolidWorks API scripting formats (C#, VBA, etc.). Probably 75% of what they wrote just failed to run, and even when they had access to browse the documentation it wasn't much better. If you're getting Opus or anything else to interact with SolidWorks from the CLI, can you say more about how you're getting it to interface effectively?2. The LLMs are indeed surprisingly bad at spatial reasoning unless prompted specifically and individually. The most notable case of this is when they need to choose the right plane to sketch on. When creating revolve features, they'll often choose the face that would've only worked if they were going to extrude rather than revolve, and when creating sweeps they'll often try to put the sketch that's going to be swept on the same plane as the path that's being swept. If you go back and ask them why they did that and point out that it's wrong, they can fix it pretty fast, but when left to their own devices they often get quite stuck on this.",

Is just giving it a \"reference prompt\" enough to produce any interesting results?I have a mini query language in the CLI that implements a lot of spatial queries, both structured and via prompts (another LLM translates the prompt to a structured query), against the Altium file format and an intermediate representation I keep. Most queries and editing commands use relative positioning (\"to the left of\"), units (\"right edge minus 10mm\"), and parameters (U1.P1.Top + MinSpacing * 5), etc. The LLM rarely needs to use concrete units because it's mostly parametrized by component clearances and design rules - I just choose some numbers at the beginning like board size and layer stackup (mostly set by the fab).The CLI has over a hundred subcommands and I use Claude skills to split up the documentation, but the agent actively explores the schematic and PCB themselves. The Claude skills include instructions to use the measurement subcommands to sanity check after making a move or when doing a review at the end, although I'm in the process of implementing a GPU based design rule checker. My Solidworks interface works the same but there are many more \"verbs\" there for the LLM to manage.At the end of the day it's mostly just orchestrating another tool which does most of the spatial logic and calculations. It's definitely easier with Altium than Solidworks so far.",

Those would then be translated to Solidworks API calls, as would any editing commands. It also really helps to give it the ability to parametrize the queries so instead of \"all features smaller than 2mm\" it can say \"all features smaller than $MinFeatureSize\", with some logic and a downstream LLM to translate that parameter into values in the design and review it with the human in the loop before committing it to the project.The key is to absolutely minimize how often the LLMs think about numbers and have them think in relationships instead.

It’s harder because the distance evaluations get much more expensive when you attach a hierarchy of warps and transforms, and there are typically a lot of distance evaluations when doing ray-marching. This project reduces the cost by using a voxel cache, but animated stuff thwarts the caching, so you have to limit the amount of animation.  Another reason it’s more difficult to rig & animate SDFs is because you only get a limited set of shapes that have analytic distance functions, or you have primitives and blending and warping that break Lipschitz conditions in your distance field, which is a fancy way of saying it’s easy to break the SDF and there are only limited and expensive ways to fix it. SDFs are much better at representing procedural content than the kind of mesh modeling involved in character animation and rendering.",

All of those tools have a shared understanding of what happens when LLVM executes on a particular target and data layout.The only flexibility is that you're allowed to alter some of the semantics on a per-target and per-datalayout basis. Targets have limited power to change semantics (for example, they cannot change what \"add\" means).

I found this passage on the technological progress in rendering snow from Frozen (2013) to Zootopia 2 fascinating:\"To give an example of the amazing amount of detail in Zootopia 2: at one point during production, our rendering team noticed some shots that had incredibly detailed snow with tons of tiny glints, so out of curiosity we opened up the shots to see how the artists had shaded the snow, and we found that they had constructed the snow out of zillions upon zillions of individual ice crystals. We were completely blown away; constructing snow this way was an idea that Disney Research had explored shortly after the first Frozen movie was made in 2013, but at the time it was purely a theoretical research idea, and a decade later our artists were just going ahead and actually doing it. The result in the final film looks absolutely amazing, and on top of that, instead of needing a specialized technology solution to make this approach feasible, in the past decade both our renderer and computers in general have gotten so much faster and our artists have improved their workflows so much that a brute-force solution was good enough to achieve this effect without much trouble at all.\"",

          "content": "Yeah, I often cite Big Hero 6 (from 2014) as the place where as an animation fan I felt Hyperion (Disney's renderer) very visibly in the end product out-paced Renderman (Pixar's more mature renderer). Big Hero 6's wide shots get truly wide and the scale of its San Fransokyo is almost palpable in many sequences, showing off especially Hyperion's focus on being able to do dynamic crowd work and large crowd scenes and plenty of architecture surrounding that. (Zootopia in 2016 further cemented that Hyperion was great at crowd work.) It was one of my complaints with Pixar's Soul in 2020 that its New Orleans felt almost claustrophobic and isolated, no truly wide establishing shots, no real crowds to speak of, mostly just shots of one or two characters in close up on city streets that in the real world New Orleans would be bustling and busy. Real New Orleans has a different kind of claustrophia from big crowds and never feels isolating or as lonely. Some of that may have been the intended vibe for that particular movie, but some of that seems technical at this point from the different focuses Hyperion and Renderman have been given and how much I think Hyperion shows technical improvement and mastery of somethings that Renderman cannot seem to do.It somewhat suggests that Disney is correct in having the two studios compete in renderers rather than share one (even as they unify other parts of the process, such as this article mentions moving to Pixar's Presto tool as one of the things that happened in Zootopia 2's production).",

          "content": "Hi! Original post author here.When I first started at Disney Animation, at one point I asked Ed Catmull what the rationale was for staffing two separate rendering teams, and he had an interesting answer. His answer was that it turns out that even when Disney Animation was using RenderMan, the high end needs of the studio still required enough rendering developers/TDs that in terms of cost it was essentially no different than staffing a team to build an in-house renderer, and from that perspective he liked the idea of having two separate teams with different focuses/perspectives so that for hard problems the wider company got two attempts at coming up with good solutions instead of one.To this day the Hyperion and RenderMan teams work pretty closely together and share a lot of learnings/tech/R&D. The focuses are pretty different between the two renderers, and that’s actually been pretty beneficial to both.The story with Presto is both a bit different and kind of similar. The two studios are now unified in using Presto, but Disney Animation now has an in-house Presto development team that co-develops Presto with Pixar. The two dev teams focus on the needs of their respective studios but move Presto forward together.",

Also for some reasons these tools tend to be relative resource hogs even when waiting for a reply from a remote provider. I mean, I am glad they exist, but it seems very rough around the edges compared to how much attention these tools get nowadays.Please run at least a dev-container or a VM for the tools. You can use RDP/ VNC/ Spice or even just the terminal with tmux to work within the confines of the container/ machine. You can mirror some stuff into the container/ machine with SSHFS, Samba/ NFS, 9p. You can use all the traditional tools, filesystems and such for reliable snapshots. Push the results separately or don't give direct unrestricted git access to the agent.It's not that hard.

You'll be keeping access and permissions where they belong, and not in a FUSE layer, and you won't have to maintain a weird abstraction that's annoying/hampered with licensing issues if you want to deploy it cross platform.Also, your simplified FUSE abstraction will not map accurately to the state of the world unless you're really comprehensive with your implementation, and at that point, you might as well be interacting directly in order to handle that state accurately.",

I have no idea how I'd pitch this to a boss to pay me to do it, but pretending that I could, I could see it being pretty interesting to do a message broker or something that worked entirely by \"writing a file to a folder\".  That way you could easily use that broker from basically anything that has file IO, even something like bash.I always have a dozen projects going on concurrently, so maybe I should add that one to the queue.",
