      "abstract": "该讨论围绕“不要陷入反AI炒作”展开，核心话题是开发者对AI编程工具（如LLM）的实用价值与职业影响的看法。多数用户认同AI是工具演进的延续，能提升效率并帮助小型团队，但也存在明显分歧。有人认为AI破坏了编程的“心流”体验，使其变得乏味且需要大量监督，产出代码质量常如初级水平；也有用户指出AI有助于知识民主化，能加速开发并解决实际问题。讨论中提到，部分人担忧AI生成代码导致软件设计质量下降，且过度依赖可能削弱开发者对底层原理的理解。共识在于，开发者应积极测试并谨慎使用AI工具，而非完全拒绝，但对其实际效果与长期职业影响仍持不同立场。",

          "content": "> But what was the fire inside you, when you coded till night to see your project working? It was building.I feel like this is not the same for everyone. For some people, the \"fire\" is literally about \"I control a computer\", for others \"I'm solving a problem for others\", and yet for others \"I made something that made others smile/cry/feel emotions\" and so on.I think there is a section of programmer who actually do like the actual typing of letters, numbers and special characters into a computer, and for them, I understand LLMs remove the fun part. For me, I initially got into programming because I wanted to ruin other people's websites, then I figured out I needed to know how to build websites first, then I found it more fun to create and share what I've done with others, and they tell me what they think of it. That's my \"fire\". But I've met so many people who doesn't care an iota about sharing what they built with others, it matters nothing to them.I guess the conclusion is, not all programmers program for the same reason, for some of us, LLMs helps a lot, and makes things even more fun. For others, LLMs remove the core part of what makes programming fun for them. Hence we get this constant back and forth of \"Can't believe others can work like this!\" vs \"I can't believe others aren't working like this!\", but both sides seems to completely miss the other side.",

LLM's are just a continuation of this trend.The naive view considers only the small scale ease of completing a task in isolation and expects compensation to be proportional to it. But that's not how things work. Yes abstraction makes individual tasks easier to complete, but with the extra time available more can be done, and as more is done and can be done, new complexities emerge. And as an individual can do more, the importance of trust grows as well. This is why CEO's make disproportionately more than their employees, because while the complexity of their work may scale only linearly with their position, or not at all even beyond a certain point, the impact of their decisions grows exponentially.LLM's are just going to enhance the power and influence of software developers.",

And I will be the first to say that I don’t think that’s because of LLMs not being able to help you.

Do you feel that any of the projects you’ve written since LLMs are the main thing you focus on are similar?Think about it this way:\n100% of you wins against 100% of me any day.\n100% of Claude running on your computer is the same as 100% of Claude running on mine.\n95% of Claude and 5% of you, while still better than me (and your average Joe), is nowhere near the same jump from 95% Claude and 5% me.I do worry when I see great programmers like you diluting their work.",

However, that domain is computer vision. So I can literally \"see\" if the code works or not!To expand, I've set up tests, benchmarks and tools that generate results as images. I chat with the LLM about a specific problem at hand, it presents various solutions, I pick a promising approach, it writes the code, I run the tests which almost always pass, but if they don't, I can hone in on the problem quickly with a visual check of the relevant images.This has allowed me to make progress despite my lack of background. Interestingly, I've now built up some domain knowledge through learning by doing and experimenting (and soon, shipping)!These days I think an agent could execute this whole loop by itself by \"looking\" at the test and result images itself. I've uploaded test images to the LLM and we had technical conversations about them as if it \"saw\" them like a human. However, there are ton of images and I don't want to burn the tokens at this point.The upshot is, if you can set up a way of reliably testing and validating the LLM's output, you could still achieve things in an unfamiliar domain without prior expertise.Taking your Postgres example, it's a heavily tested and benchmarked project. I would bet someone like Antirez would be able to jump in and do original, valid work using AI very quickly, because even if hasn't futzed with Postgres code, he HAS futzed with a LOT of other code and hence has a deep intuition about software architecture in general.So this is what I meant by the meaning of \"domain expert\" changing.

In part this is a gift, something you develop at small age, and this will, I believe, kinda change who is good at programming: good communicators / explorers may not have a edge VS very strong coders that are bad at explaining themselves.

Finding a download page, and having it just spit out an iso file, with no explanation on what to do with it, or 'how to install' link in sight (debian, it's very nice that there's a big download button, but like...then what. where's the explanation link. it's buried under other downloads, but that's not very intuitive). Getting to a 'how to install' page and having it be intimidatingly long, perhaps even needlessly. Sites, pages and explainers being laid out in confounding ways, and install process sometimes laid out in a bit of an overcomplicated way. (debian has an installation guide that's presented perhaps in the most intimidating way possible to a new unwitting user, and also buried under click on a click on a click. somehow writing the iso is not even among the first dozen of pages there. ubuntu mate gives you links to iso downloads, and yet the installation process is buried under 'faq' (again, not very intuitive or straightforward), that faq only has a bunch of oddly laid out 'making installation media' pages, and the rest of actual installation process is just somewhere else.)That's before someone even gets to the actual install process. Somehow all of that stuff hasn't gotten more streamlined or user friendly. If you try to see how one would go about getting and installing any distro, you'd quickly see that it's very confusing and convoluted, way more than it has to be, or needs to be to appeal and be simple for new users.There's glimmers of hope, like fedora which has its media writer, which is gonna hold your hand through the whole thing. Even that links out to github for a download, despite clicking on a seemingly specific 'windows/mac or linux' button. It's a little buried too, below iso downloads, when it really should be brought up more forward, and explain a little bit better on how it's gonna guide you thru the whole thing.It really should be an app that's gonna guide you thru it, or a dead simple 1-2-3 step tutorial that's gonna guide you thru writing an image (download writer, download iso, write an image - laying it out more than that is just overcomplicating it really, at least in the initial quick install guide), with a clear, visible link to it - and yet somehow even this is too high of a bar for many distros to clear.What has done a number on the ease of installing linux is how compact discs have just went away, because having a compact disc, burning it, or having it be just sent to users was making that step of the process simpler. Sure, writing to a USB is easy, but the expectation that everyone's just gonna have a spare usb is naive (and you're never gonna hear that you actually need to buy a usb stick in any of those guides lol), and there's just a little more opportunity to fuck up there (overwriting other disks, unless the writer app is laid out nicely and fail-proof). Distros might as well start selling usb sticks with installers on them. If someone's gonna be brand new to the whole thing and they're gonna have to buy a usb stick anyway, they might as well buy it from the distro with the distro on it already.Some distros may want to get real about how a new user would even navigate their websites in order to get the thing. Like just trying to go thru that process themselves and see what's that experience like.",

These operating systems are for people who just want to use that ecosystem and not need to manage anything themselves. Battery life is exceptional. Most people I know need a one or two step process to do things (like backup photos contacts documents etc) and Apple google Microsoft offer you that. It’s not perfect but it’s easy to manage. People really have gotten used to someone managing it for them and these things do fine in that regard. It’s better than people having 5 hard drives with photos and misplacing them imo. I’ve had people in 2000s connect drives to my computers and find private pictures and contacts and files etc I need not be having access to. iCloud and Google Photos offer you that peace of mind. With 2FA you’d rather lose it all than fall into the wrong hands. People have all kinds of stuff on their phones and computers that should not leave their computers and accounts. Imagine having your kids classmates find your intimate pictures on some drive they used to copy something your kid gave them. All this has reduced with cloud managed services with activation locks and 2FA and password mangers built into them.

Even in this thread people are recommending Gen 1 Thinkpads, but Lenovo’s heart really isn’t in it across the board. Dell went simple with the revived XPS but the release versions don’t offer Linux in the BYO order flow.And no, I don’t think Framework is good enough.",

Drivers are simply easier to install and they generally don't require a reboot and they don't require messing with kernel modules, IO is non-blocking by default, and a bunch of other things that are cool and arguably better than Linux.The problem is that, while the kernel is an important part of an operating system, it's not the only part.  Even if the NT kernel were the objectively best piece of software ever to be written by humans, that still doesn't change the fact that Windows has become a pretty awful mess. They have loaded the OS with so much crap (and ads now!), the Windows Update tool routinely breaks your computer, their recovery/repair tools simply do not work, their filesystem is geriatric and has been been left behind compared to stuff like ZFS, btrfs, and APFS, and they don't really seem determined to fix any of this stuff.Even if the Linux kernel were to be slightly worse, it's still good enough.  Even if you do have to muck with kernel modules it's not that hard now with DKMS. Even if the IO is blocking by default epoll has been around for decades and works fine.So at that point, if the kernel is good enough, and if we can get userland decent enough, then desktop Linux is better than Windows.

There has been one time in 5 years that he had to reach out for technical assistance. It turned out that he had been misled by a prompt to buy Ubuntu pro and had gotten into a weird state. I blame that one solely on canonical, not on Linux in general. After that I switched him to Fedora, and he's been running that now for a few years and didn't even realize I had changed his underlying OS. He is able to install anything he wants from the graphical storefront, and same with updates. In the early days we did have some trouble getting his printer to work, though once we switched him to Fedora everything on that printer worked out of the box. When my sister came over to his house with her MacBook, she had to mess with the Mac to get the printer working for over an hour, and it was still pretty hit or miss. It would lose half the jobs she tried to send to it. It truly is remarkable how usable Linux is for the average person now. For people that have to run software that only runs on Windows or Linux, excluding games of course since steam and other game managers handle those wonderfully now, there is definitely still a bit of pain. But for people who can get by with cloud-based or Linux friendly software, it's really quite good.",

Maybe you're into cars, I don't know, but I bet you take this attitude to at least some of the useful objects in your life.",

          "content": "After years of wondering what the post-UNIX paradigm of computing could look like, these past few months I've been prototyping a software platform built around capabilities and message passing, targeting Linux and bare-metal RISC-V. The big ideas I'm pursuing is a stackless design running on a flat address space with lightweight processes to minimize message-passing latency, and all the benefits of capabilities so every process is sandboxed and has only access to capabilities they have been explicitly passed via message passing.I've also built a RISC-V emulator to integrate with this platform, so eventually it'll be able to run native binaries written in any language, completely sandboxed, completely built around message-passing. Basically a native, low-level BEAM-like platform to build an entire operating system and user-space.While my day job is writing boring applications, this is the stuff that keeps me awake at night, and I would love so much to talk and write more about this, about the trial-and-errors I'm facing, but it's still so much in flux every week I'm exploring a new approach. Most of my work has been around the stackless scheduler, and I have a plan to achieve preemption for long-running or misbehaved tasks without having to compromise on memory usage (i.e. without giving each process its own stack and allocate memory for context switching).Eventually I'd like to layer on top either Cap'n Proto or another high-performance serialisation system to create a distributed, introspectable environment of object-capabilities that are sending typed messages between each other, achieving the ultimate goal of creating an unholy hybrid between Smalltalk and the Erlang VM.God, how I wish I was paid to work on this type of problems :-)If this sounds close to your area of interests, please send me an email and I’d love to chat.",

Scanning is maintained by a single person.Ubuntu 26.04 LTS is expected to be the last version with CUPS v2. CUPS v3 drops current printer driver architecture and introduces proper modern driverless printing with the wrapper for older drivers. Many open-source drivers are already use this wrapper, but expect a huge disarrangement from the users, as none of the proprietary drivers would work out of the box anymore.Do you care about printing?

But the game and many of its ilk are super frustrating. They have ads and arbitrarily make it impossible at some point to keep going (in order to show more ads I assume.) So I combined my love of roguelike deck-builders and made a game for her. It's the same basic premise of filling rows and columns but it has a deck you improve over several boards of ever-increasing complexity. And it has cards with special powers (of course.) It turned out to be really fun both to build and play. I'm still working out a few kinks (I built it in Love2D but running inside iOS is a challenge...) But it's live in the App Store.

And it's more fun to see global coverage anyways. Over the past couple of years, I've been getting emails for similar features that would expose city/country wide stats as well. Going to share with the users of the old app once I port its features on this one.Still actively polishing it over the weekends, but it's very fun to see all the places I've been to on a hex-based map, combine it with my friends' data, and so on.

A basic IDE (called the Bench) to try Circuitscript is available online: https://bench.circuitscript.net/During the December break, I have implemented some new features: automatic stable refdes annotations, parameter assignment rules for easy part number assignment and some ERC rules. These are also important parts of the design workflow to help turn a schematic into a usable BOM and layout.I have created a usb-uart converter board with the CH340 chip. The complete schematic was coded with Circuitscript and then imported as a netlist into kicad pcbnew to do the pcb layout. The design was produced with JLCPCB and after receiving the boards I tested them and they do work! The design files are here https://github.com/liu3hao/usb-uart-bridge. The circuitscript code file is here https://github.com/liu3hao/usb-uart-bridge/blob/main/usb_uar... and the generated pdf from the circuitscript code is here: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/liu3hao/usb-uart-bridge/re...The motivation for creating Circuitscript is to describe schematics in terms of code rather than graphical UIs after using different CAD packages extensively (Allegro, Altium, KiCAD) for work in the past. I wanted to spend more time thinking about the schematic design itself rather than fiddling around with GUIs.Please check it out and I look forward to your feedback, especially from electronics designers/hobbyists.

Because an x.0 release inevitably has issues, it offers less than a year of stability (sometimes only a few months if it takes until x.4 to be fully stable) before things get broken again in y.0. And because Apple stops signing old versions pretty quickly, you’re often stuck on an unstable new version if you take the risk and upgrade.Additionally, it is hard on all developers (Apple included) to release updates for all of its many platforms on the same day, which IMO reduces software quality across the ecosystem.(Apple also has the luxury of only supporting the latest OS versions with its software.

Then they A/B tested it with the text a little bigger, then a bit bolder, then even higher, and it finally worked its way up to the top of the page in BIG HUGE BOLD TEXT!More about Ted's work:https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=34425576Ted Selker fondly reminds me of \"Mr. Lossoff\" the \"Button Man\" in \"A Nero Wolfe Mystery” episode “The Mother Hunt”, where Archie drops in on \"Mister Lossoff’s Distinguished Buttons” in the garment district of New York:https://youtu.be/h-QgWOSVKm4?t=724He's totally THAT enthusiastic, a distinguished expert fiendishly obsessed with buttons! He even carries around a big bag of replacement Joy Buttons that he hands out for free like candy to anyone who’s worn theirs out.I know this from personal experience: Ted and his wife Ellen once ran into me working on my Thinkpad at some coffee shop in Mountain View, and Ted noticed my worn out Joy Button. He excused himself to run out to his car to fetch his Button Bag, while Ellen smiled at me and rolled her eyes up into her head and shrugged, and we hung out and talked until he got back. I really appreciated a nice new crisp one with fresh bumpy texture, because mine was totally worn down, and it made his day to get rid of a few. (I imagine their house has hoards of boxes and piles of bags full of them!)The common thread: design that makes you come. Back for more, that is. Buttons to lick till they click.

Everything from being able to clearly distinguish UI elements, to general accessibility, to discoverability, everything got worse.Operating Systems are one of the most complicated systems we created, not because they're a collection of processes and thread, but because everything is built on top of them and creating something that's well thought out and stable, and intuitive is really hard. Designers just randomly creating visual elements just because it looks cool and not paying attention how people are going to use it is simply half assing the whole thing.That's still one of the reasons I believe Alan Dye was let go, fired in a sense, he had power over the company, but with that power he screwed things so much that we need to rediscover all the things related to usability in very high detail as if we're rediscovering the wheel, just so that we can get back to square one.",

I exchanged it for a Mac, which I've spent a literal lifetime using, because I didn't wanna fall down a Linux tinkering hole trying to make Gubuntu feel like home.  Every corp device I've had has been a Mac.I'm reading this from a coffee shop. On my walk here, I was idly wondering if I should give Glinux (as its now called) a try when I'm forced to replace the iMac.

If it's affecting only a tiny number of users, and you just happen to be an unlucky one, and they don't know how to reproduce it, and you can't help them reproduce it, then what? I think they just have to wait until somebody (such as yourself) is able to figure out with some kind of logging what is happening. E.g. the first question to answer is probably what actually gets the focus, if anything? To produce a bug report that at least suggests which area of code might be responsible.I had a similar problem at one point, then finally figured out it was when I accidentally hit the fn button which triggered the emoji picker window and moved focus to it (IIRC), but it was off-screen because I'd previously used it on a secondary monitor. Reconnecting the monitor and moving the window back to my primary display fixed it. (Obviously, it's a bug to show a picker window outside of visible coordinates, and I think it got fixed eventually.)But it also might not be Apple at all, if it's some third-party background utility with a bug. E.g. if that were happening to me, my first thought would be that it might be a Logitech bug or a Karabiner-Elements bug.

Then in win10 onwards they shrunk the border down to one pixel with the zone around it where you can click off the window but still affect it.On the back of my mind I think part of this was the move to fit scaling to large resolution monitors (i.e. 4k+) work better, as a graphical border of a fixed pixel width will shrink proportionally compared to a border that is as thin as it can be. For a while I've felt that it's a missed opportunity on high res displays to not use more detailed art for window chrome as pixel wide will only get smaller and more difficult to distinguish, such as the minimize/maximize/close icons which remain pixel wide line art even at big scaling.",

GNOME has a tendency of forcing UIs on users, and Ubuntu with Unity, now GNOME again, etc. Though, thankfully, since the user is free to choose their own desktop environment and window manager, it's not as pressing of an issue.I realized many years ago that simpler UIs deliver the best UX. This is a large reason why I love the command line so much. Most programs have a fixed and stable interface, and can be composed to do what I want. For graphical programs I prefer using a simple window manager like bspwm on X, and niri on Wayland. These don't draw window decorations, and are primarily keyboard-driven, so I don't need superfluous graphics. I only need a simple status bar that shows my workspaces, active window, and some system information. I recently configured it with Quickshell[1], and couldn't be happier. I plan to use this setup for years to come, and it gives me great peace of mind knowing that no company can take that away from me.

          "content": "I worked on Finder/TimeMachine/Spotlight/iOS at Apple from 2000-2007. I worked closely with Bas Ording, Stephen Lemay, Marcel van Os, Imran Chaudry, Don Lindsey and Greg Christie. I have no experience with any of the designers who arrived in the post-Steve era. During my time, Jony Ive didn't figure prominently in the UI design, although echoes of his industrial design appeared in various ways in the graphic design of the widgets. Kevin Tiene and Scott Forstall had more influence for better or worse, extreme skeumorphism for example.The UX group would present work to Steve J. every Thursday and Steve quickly passed judgement often harshly and without a lot of feedback, leading to even longer meetings afterward to try and determine course corrections. Steve J. and Bas were on the same wavelength and a lot of what Bas would show had been worked on directly with Steve before hand. Other things would be presented for the first time, and Steve could be pretty harsh. Don, Greg, Scott, Kevin would push back and get abused, but they took the abuse and could make in-roads.Here is my snapshot of Stephen from the time. He presented the UI ideas for the intial tabbed window interface in Safari. He had multiple design ideas and Steve dismissed them quickly and harshly. Me recollection was that Steve said something like No, next, worse, next, even worse, next, no. Why don't you come back next week with something better. Stephen didn't push back, say much, just went ok and that was that. I think Greg was the team manager at the time and pushed Steve for more input and maybe got some. This was my general observation of how Stephen was over 20 years ago.I am skeptical and doubtful about Stephen's ability to make a change unless he is facilitated greatly by someone else or has somehow changed drastically. The fact that he has been on the team while the general opinion of Apple UX quality has degraded to the current point of the Tahoe disaster is telling. Several team members paid dearly in emotional abuse under Steve and decided to leave rather than deal with the environment post Steve's death. Stephen is a SJ-era original and should have been able to push hard against what many of us perceive as very poor decisons. He either agreed with those decisions, or did not, and choose to go with the flow and enjoy the benefits of working at Apple. This is fine I guess. Many people are just fine going with the flow and not rocking the boat. It may be even easier when you have Apple-level comp and benefits.My opinon; unless Stephen gets a very strong push from other forces, I don't see that he has the will or fortitude to make the changes that he himself has approved in one way or another. Who will push him? Tim Cook, Craig Federighi, Eddy Cue, Phil Schiller? The perceived mess of Tahoe happened on the watch of all of these Apple leaders.",

We built a system where writing docs, tutorials, and open technical content paid off indirectly through traffic, subscriptions, or services. LLMs get a lot of value from that work, but they also break the loop that used to send value back to the people and companies who created it.The Tailwind CSS situation is a good example. They built something genuinely useful, adoption exploded, and in the past that would have meant more traffic, more visibility, and more revenue. Now the usage still explodes, but the traffic disappears because people get answers directly from LLMs. The value is clearly there, but the money never reaches the source. That is less a moral problem and more an economic one.Ideas like GPL-style licensing point at the right tension, but they are hard to apply after the fact. These models were built during a massive spending phase, financed by huge amounts of capital and debt, and they are not even profitable yet. Figuring out royalties on top of that, while the infrastructure is already in place and rolling out at scale, is extremely hard.That is why this feels like a much bigger governance problem. We have a system that clearly creates value, but no longer distributes it in a sustainable way. I am not sure our policies or institutions are ready to catch up to that reality yet.",

Humans barely tolerate these ad filled websites. And yet, local news went into steep decline, and the big national players got an ever-larger share of attention. The large, national sites were able to keep a subscriber-based paywall model. These were largely legacy media sites (ie: NYT).2. News sites lost the local classifieds market, as the cost of advertising online went to zero (ie: Craigslist). This dynamic was a form of creative destruction - a better solution ate the business of an older solution.3. Blog monetization was always tough, beyond ads. Unless you were a big blog, you couldn't make a living. What about getting a small amount of money per view from random visitors? The internet never developed a micro-payment or subscription model for the set of open sites - the blogosphere, etc. The best we got were closed platforms like Substack and Medium, which could control access via paywalls.All this led to the internet being largely funded through the \"attention economy\": ads mostly, paywalls & subscriptions some.The attention economy can't sustain itself when there are fewer eyeballs:1. Tailwind docs have to be added just once to the training set for the AI to be proficient in that framework forever.

One of the implicit tradeoffs you make buying SaaS is that the overall cost of evolution (development and ongoing maintenance) is subsidized across all of the investment resources and customer base of the vendor. With CRM in particular, ecosystem integration is one of the heaviest buildouts there is because each point solution integration can very significantly in complexity and is also where the combinatoric explosion of misbehavior sets in.When you decide to pull that in house, you are implicitly burdening yourself with the cost of the buildout as well as ongoing maintenance. True, you could probably knock together an okay v1 of CRM yourself inhouse. But are you really going to get it to and maintain production level quality over time at a lower total cost of ownership? I'm skeptical.The theoretical party you are describing would probably be better served by simply avoiding Salesforce in favor of a next gen CRM that is both more cost effective and easier to customize. In enterprise contexts, even HubSpot is effectively next gen, but there are also products like Attio et al that have a ton of adoption and strong integration ecosystems (albeit not at the Salesforce level).When you buy enterprise software from a vendor you are buying more than \"just software\" you are also hiring a company's services. And the inverse is correct as well, when you choose to build it in house, you are implicitly choosing to hire a team internally to resource all of the services you would've expected that vendor to provide.Certainly, this tradeoff can still make a lot of sense for some companies. The acid test for that, in my opinion, is whether said company could (and would) actually successfully sell the product they build internally on the open market. If the answer to that is \"yes\", the prospect of turning a cost center into a profit center can potentially bear significant long term ROI to the company.",

They seem to raise money based on a rendering of  a ski lodge.A huge, concrete investment in TerraPower would be more interesting, but as a molten salt SMR which has never been built, this also looks extremely non-committal.SMRs in general seem like a dead end, we’ve heard about them for decades and they don’t seem to be any closer to making nuclear power buildouts less expensive.Everything that makes proven nuclear power plant design expensive seems to revolve around the same drivers of expense for all long-term construction: large up front capital requirements, changing regulations, failure to predict setbacks, and pervasive lawsuits.

There are four in operation, two in the US, and another dozen or so under construction.Most of the small nuclear reactor startups hand-wave the failure modes and argue that they don't need the hulking big expensive containment building. NuScale claimed that. \nThey wanted multiple reactors sharing the same cooling pool. If they ever had a leak, the whole set of reactors would be contaminated, even without a meltdown.If we look at the big reactor accidents so far, there's Chernobyl, with no containment building. There's Fukushima, with too small a containment unable to contain the pressure. And there's Three Mile Island, where a large, strong containment building contained a meltdown. Three Mile Island was an expensive disaster, but not hazardous outside the plant. That's the failure mode you want.We might be better off at developing better techniques for welding thick sections to make hulking big, strong containment vessels. There's been progress with robotic welding of thick sections.[1][1] https://www.agrrobotics.com/trends-s-industry-analysis/roadm...",

If you can build a battery for four hours duration, then of course you can build another to get to 8, or however many you want. Batteries are being added to the grid at a huge rate.> natural gas peaker plants are very expensive and increase CO2 emissions. There isn't much of an alternative to nuclear.Gas peakers are about the same cost as nuclear. We will have a ton of gas peakers hanging around in the coming decades, and they will be used less and less as we get more batteries on the grid. Already, batteries eat peakers' lunch economically.In the most optimistic grid modeling scenarios, nuclear can play a 5% or 10% role in a fully decarbonized grid. If you go full nuclear, then you also need a ton of batteries. And if nuclear was cheap, I would advocate going for a ton of nuclear plus batteries. But nuclear is super expensive, and doesn't scale fast enough to meet our needs.We are currently at 20% nuclear power in the US and have a rapidly aging fleet. Even if we had investors who wanted to spend the $500B it would take to keep 5% of our grid as nuclear, it's unlikely we'd be able to build those 50 1GW reactors over the course of the next 20 years. Scaling SMRs seems even less likely.I really hope I'm wrong and the SMRs somehow materialize and are cheap, but none of the startups are acting like the have anything real or the chops to scale. A new reactor getting built by 2032, as suggested here? Pumping out an SMR in 6 years, when design isn't even finalized, the company hasn't shown progress since abandoning an NRC application, does not seem plausible.",

Currently the hypotheses for why the cable disintegrated so quickly is hydrolysis and paint solvents. Singapore is extremely humid but this doesn't explain why the exposed cabling on the other end is still healthy and not crumbly.The second possibility is that I keep the leftover wall paints (Nippon Paint Vinilex 5000) in the same room and have noticed that much of the solvents have evaporated. It is possible that the solvents in the air might have caused the cable to fail in 3 years. It would explain why the other ends that aren't exposed to the air inside the bomb shelter aren't falling apart.Some other learnings from this. Buried cabling should always be permanently fixed and attached to a patch panel instead of dangling in the open. That was the original plan but I figured it wouldn’t be an issue. I was wrong. Always measure exact length of buried fibre cabling as they aren’t meant to be stored in loops.",

Ex: Plan mode is basically bootstrapping how that TODO list gets seeded and how todos ground themselves when they get reached, and user interactions are how you realign the todo lists. The todolist is subtle but was a big shift in coding tools, and many seem to be surprised when we discuss it -- most seem to focus on whether to use plan mode or not, but todo lists will still be active. I ran a fun experiment last month on how well claude code solves CTFs, and disabling the TodoList tool and planning is 1-2 grade jumps: https://media.ccc.de/v/39c3-breaking-bots-cheating-at-blue-t... .Fwiw, I found it funny how the article stuffs \"smarter context management\" into a breeze-y TODO bullet point at the end for going production-grade. I've been noticing a lot of NIH/DIY types believing they can do a good job of this and then, when forced to have results/evals that don't suck in production, losing the rest of the year on that step.

          "content": "It's a great point and everyone should know it: the core of a coding agent is really simple, it's a loop with tool calling.Having said that, I think if you're going to write an article like this and call it \"The Emperor Has No Clothes: How to Code Claude Code in 200 Lines of Code\", you should at least include a reference to Thorsten Ball's excellent article from wayyy back in April 2025 entitled \"How to Build an Agent, or: The Emperor Has No Clothes\" (https://ampcode.com/how-to-build-an-agent)! That was (as far as I know) the first of these articles making the point that the core of a coding agent is actually quite simple (and all the deep complexity is in the LLM). Reading it was a light-bulb moment for me.FWIW, I agree with other commenters here that you do need quite a bit of additional scaffolding (like TODOs and much more) to make modern agents work well. And Claude Code itself is a fairly complex piece of software with a lot of settings, hooks, plugins, UI features, etc. Although I would add that once you have a minimal coding agent loop in place, you can get it to bootstrap its own code and add those things! That is a fun and slightly weird thing to try.(By the way, the \"January 2025\" date on this article is clearly a typo for 2026, as Claude Code didn't exist a year ago and it includes use of the claude-sonnet-4-20250514 model from May.)Edit: and if you're interested in diving deeper into what Claude Code itself is doing under the hood, a good tool to understand it is \"claude-trace\" (https://github.com/badlogic/lemmy/tree/main/apps/claude-trac...). You can use it to see the whole dance with tool calls and the LLM: every call out to the LLM and the LLM's responses, the LLM's tool call invocations and the responses from the agent to the LLM when tools run, etc. When Claude Skills came out I used this to confirm my guess about how they worked (they're a tool call with all the short skill descriptions stuffed into the tool description base prompt). Reading the base prompt is also interesting. (Among other things, they explicitly tell it not to use emoji, which tracks as when I wrote my own agent it was indeed very emoji-prone.)",

I built a persistent Python REPL subprocess as an MCP tool for CC, it worked so insanely well that I decided to go all the way. I already had an agentic framework built around tool calling (agentlib), so I adapted it for this new paradigm and code agent was born.The agent \"boots up\" inside the REPL. Here's the beginning of the system prompt:  >>> help(assistant)\n\n  You are an interactive coding assistant operating within a Python REPL.\n  Your responses ARE Python code—no markdown blocks, no prose preamble.\n  The code you write is executed directly.\n\n  >>> how_this_works()\n\n  1. You write Python code as your response\n  2. The code executes in a persistent REPL environment\n  3. Output is shown back to you IN YOUR NEXT TURN\n  4. Call `respond(text)` ...\n\nYou get the idea. No need for custom file editing tools--Python has all that built in and Claude knows it perfectly. No JSON marshaling or schema overhead. Tools are just Python functions injected into the REPL, zero context bloat.I also built a browser control plugin that puts Claude directly into the heart of a live browser session. It can inject element pickers so I can click around and show it what I'm talking about. It can render prototype code before committing to disk, killing the annoying build-fix loop. I can even SSH in from my phone and use TTS instead of typing, surprisingly great for frontend design work. Knocked out a website for my father-in-law's law firm (gresksingleton.com) in a few hours that would've taken 10X that a couple years ago, and it was super fun.The big win: complexity. CC has been a disaster on my bookkeeping system, there's a threshold past which Claude loses the forest for the trees and makes the same mistakes over and over. Code agent pushes that bar out significantly. Claude can build new tools on the fly when it needs them. Gemini works great too (larger context).Have fun out there! /end-rant",

Having said that, it's not clear how much that really matters at all for making the Claude Code CLI specifically better-performing than other coding agents using the same LLM (the tool calls are fairly generic and the LLMs are good at plenty of tool calls they weren't RLVRed on too).The other advantage Anthropic have is just that they can sell CC subscriptions at lower cost because they own the models. But that's a separate set of questions that don't really relate to technical capabilities.Anyhow, to follow up on your point, I do find it surprising that Claude Code is still (it seems?) definitively leading the pack in terms of coding agents. I've tried Gemini CLI and Codex and they feel distinctly less good, but I'm surprised we haven't seen too many alternatives from small startups or open source projects rise to the top as well. After all, they can build on all the lessons learned from previous agents (UX, context management, features people like such as Skills etc.). Maybe we will see more of this in 2026.",

So much of the current ecosystem is suboptimal just because it's new. The models are trained around immutable conversation ledgers with user/tool/assistant blocks, but there are compelling reasons to manipulate both sides at runtime and add synthetic exchanges. Priming with a synthetic failure and recovery is often more effective than a larger, more explicit system message. Same with memory, we just haven't figured out what works best.For code agents specifically, I found myself wanting old style completion models without the structured turn training--doesn't exist for frontier models. Talking to Claude about its understanding of the input token stream was fascinating; it compared it to my visual cortex and said it'd be unreasonable to ask me to comment on raw optic nerve data.\"Tell it to reread it again\"-exactly the problem. My bookkeeping/decision engine has so much documentation I'm running out of context, and every bit is necessary due to interconnected dependencies. Telling it to reread content already in the window feels wrong, that's when I refine the docs or adjust the framework. I've also found myself adding way more docstrings and inline docs than I'd ever write for myself. I prefer minimal, self-documenting code, so it's a learning process.There's definitely an art to prompts, and it varies wildly by model, completely different edge cases across the leading ones.

These days I usually add diagrams to get really clear on what happens on which side of the model api.I do wonder whether the path here was:1) You wrote the article in April 20252) The next generation of LLMs trained on your article3) The author of TFA had a similar idea, and heavily used LLMs to help write the code and the article, including asking the LLM to think of a catchy title. And guess what title the LLM comes up with?There are also less charitable interpretations, of course. But I'd rather assume this was honestly, if sloppily, done.",

Heck it even suggested doing daily dumps of the database and saving to minio and then removing after that. Also knows about the limitations of 8 gigs of ram and how to make sure docker settings for the difference self services I want to build don't cause issues.Give me a month and true strong intention and ability to google and read posts and find the answer on my own and I still don't think I would have gotten to this point with the amount of trust I have in the setup.I very much agree with this topic about self hosting coming alive because these models can walk you through everything. Self building and self hosting can really come alive.

That's good news I think.But Tailscale is the real unlock in my opinion. Having a slot machine cosplaying as sysadmin is cool, but being able to access services securely from anywhere makes them legitimately usable for daily life. It means your services can be used by friends/family if they can get past an app install and login.I also take minor issue with running Vaultwarden in this setup.

A new article, published in Science on January 8th, suggests, instead, that a supply shock drove the decrease.The supply shock sounds right.I was volunteering at a state run institution, who had an addiction data science team, at the peak of the opioid crisis.  I was developing ml models to predict patient dropout early in a 32 week program.  The data and funding for such research was very scarce and it didn't go anywhere.Treatment for opioid use disorder with medication is highly effective for 50% - 90% who respond well to treatment.  The problem with the bottom 50% was early dropout, due to the lack of dissemination of proper treatment protocols and stigma attached to medication for treatment (methadone).  I stopped following the work, I became too sensitive, it was pretty depressing.The pandemic coupled with the increase in illicit fentanyl was just tragic in what it did to people.  I remember reading the DEA research, where the precursor for fentanyl came from china and was manufactured and distributed from mexico.  Mexico was also manufacturing high quality meth and displaced most of the meth labs in america, coming with increases in meth overdose during the same period.  The fentanyl was so cheap compared to traditional heroin manufacturing.I'm glad the supply seems to have dried up.  It was nuts, what was going on a few years ago.",

They essentially set up the patient to be a lifetime methadone addict. This may be an improvement over getting your fix on the street but it's still addiction dependence and it's expensive (profitable!).  I'm unsure if it's just a few or a large fraction of them that operate this way. Maybe my data point is a unique outlier but here's what I saw:I had a friend who was going through the program in Springfield Missouri, approximately 10 years ago, and the clinic literally increased his dose every week or two. They also had strict controls to make sure the patients actually take the full dose (because otherwise they might sell some of it on the street). So they were left with just 2 options, either drop out of the program and find their fix elsewhere, or accept a gradually increasing dose of methadone, forever.  It's a sick program that is set up to make sure patients gradually descend deeper into addiction while they rake in huge profits.  It's not really any different from what the drug dealers on the street are doing except that it's even more exploitative and dishonest.  The doctors had zero plan for weaning people off of the methadone and some people had been on the program for years, with correspondingly huge doses doled out to them every time they came in. This was 10 years ago, at the time it cost something like $50 per visit, paid by the patient or possibly medicaid.Edited slightly for clarity.",

          "content": "> I’ve heard a plausible explanationTo be blunt it was total bullshit. Pharmaceuticals have an extremely wide range of dosages. Fentanyl is on the extreme low end, benadryl an adult might take 25 mg or 50 mg, tylenol an adult might take 500 mg, and something like amoxicillin an adult might take as much as 3000 mg for a severe infection. There are standard, extremely reliable ways to prepare pills that contain the correct dosage regardless of the potency of the pure chemical.Obviously fentanyl (or its precursor) is imported (ie smuggled) in highly pure form in order to minimize the size of the shipment. Obviously it can't be consumed in that form.The combination of being potent and cheap to smuggle lends itself nicely to cutting other (more expensive) products with it. That's false advertising but it won't typically kill you in and of itself.When laymen who don't know what they're doing, don't have access to proper facilities, and certainly can't set up proper quality controls process something that potent it's no wonder that things go wrong and people die. If (for example) the same victims had purchased fentanyl from a pharmacy (as opposed to whatever it was they thought they were consuming) they almost certainly would not have had any issues. Almost no one ODs intentionally.The point is that it's not \"fentanyl is toxic so you OD\" it's \"the person compounding the pill messed up the dosage, you took more than you thought, so you OD\". This could happen just as easily with any other drug. The danger here is due to pills not containing the dosage that the consumer believes them to.",

The idea was to impose XML’s strict parsing rules: well-formed documents only, close all your tags, lowercase element names, quote all attributes, and if the document is malformed, the parser must stop and display an error rather than guess. XHTML was abandoned in 2009.\nWhen HTML5 was being drafted in 2004-onwards, the WHATWG actually had to formally specify how browsers should handle malformed markup, essentially codifying IE’s error-recovery heuristics as the standard.",

It makes parsing HTML easier because there are fewer syntax rules.I learned HTML quite late, when HTML 5 was already all the rage, and I never understood why the more strict rules of XML for HTML never took off. They seem so much saner than whatever soup of special rules and exceptions we currently have. HTML 5 was an opportunity to make a clear cut between legacy HTML and the future of HTML.

And then you'll understand why I'm not going to even begin to attempt to answer your question about how browsers handle various tag combinations. Instead my point is only that, with HTML5, there is in fact a very concrete answer that is no longer up to the browsers trying to each individually spackle over the various and sundry gaps in the standards.But honestly no answer to \"what does the browser do with this sort of thing\" fits into an HN comment anymore.

Render anyway, skip the invalid html, or stop rendering with an error message? HTML did not specify what to do with invalid input, so either is legal. Browsers choose to go with the “render anyway” approach, but this lead to different outputs in different browsers, since it wasn’t agreed upon how to render invald html.The difference between Netscape and IE was that Netscape in more cases would skip rendering invalid HTML, where IE would always render the content.",

          "content": "You read things like this and, first, you're reminded of Sideshow Bob [1] and it puts Rust concepts in context, namely:1. Move semantics are to handle ownership. Ownership is a first-class concept in Rust. This is why;2. C++ smart pointers (eg std::unique_ptr<>) are likewise to handle ownership and incur a runtime cost where in Rust they are handled by the compiler with no runtime cost. Yes you can \"cheat\" (eg std::unique_ptr::get) and people do (they have to) but this is a worse (IMHO) version than the much-maligned Rust unsafe blocks;3. Not only do all features have a complexity cost but that curve is exponential because of the complexity of interactions, in this case move semantics and exceptions. At this point C++'s feature set combined with legacy code support is not just an albatross around its neck, it's an elephant seal; and4. There's a 278 page book on C++ initialization [2].My point here is that there are so many footguns here combined with the features of modern processors that writing correct code remains a Herculean (even Sisyphean) task.But here's the worst part: IME all of this complexity tends to attract a certain kind of engineer who falls in love with their own cleverness who creates code using obscure features that nobody else can understand all the true implications (and likely they don't either).Rust is complex because what you're doing is complex. Rust isn't a panacea. It solves a certain class of problems well and that class is really important (ie memory safety). We will be dealing with C++ buffer overflow CVEs until the heat death of the Universe. But one thing I appreciate about languages like Go is how simple they are.I honestly think C++ is unsalvageable given its legacy.[1]: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2WZLJpMOxS4[2]: https://leanpub.com/cppinitbook",

C++智能指针（如std::unique_ptr<>）同样用于处理所有权，但会产生运行时开销，而Rust通过编译器处理这些机制，无需运行时成本。虽然可以通过\"取巧\"方式绕过限制（例如使用std::unique_ptr::get），开发者确实也这样做（有时不得不这样做），但在我看来，这比备受争议的Rust不安全代码块更不理想；3. 所有语言特性不仅会带来复杂度代价，而且由于特性间的相互作用（比如移动语义与异常处理的交织），复杂度曲线是指数级增长的。当前C++的特性集合加上对遗留代码的兼容支持，已不仅是挂在脖子上的信天翁，简直是海象级别的负担；4. 关于C++初始化的专著竟有278页之多[2]。我想强调的是，现代处理器的特性与这些语言陷阱相结合，使得编写正确代码成为堪比赫拉克勒斯（甚至西西弗斯）式的艰巨任务。但最糟糕的是：根据我的经验，这种复杂性往往会吸引特定类型的工程师，他们沉迷于自我制造的\"精巧\"，运用晦涩特性编写出无人能完全理解其深层含义的代码（很可能他们自己也不完全理解）。Rust之所以复杂，是因为你正在处理的问题本身就复杂。Rust不是万能灵药。它擅长解决特定类型的问题，而这类问题恰恰至关重要（例如内存..."

In the latter case, you want to do memcpy(new, old) and be done, not std::swap(old[i], new[i]) for each int.I think a lot of the motive for adding move semantics to c++ has to do with giving the compiler enough information to produce results that are both optimal and correct in generic code.",

This nice and all but breaks when using pairs (for reasons you can google but I don't wanna explain here). So now you have these obscure classes like https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/utility/piecewise_construc... which solve this.Example for 2:Basically they never break the ABI and this leads to tons of old stuff hanging around and never being changed and just more stuff being added on top. std::iostream is famously slow and a big reason is because you can't fix it without breaking the abi which they don't wanna do.Example for 3:The whole template thing adds so much complexity it's bonkers, I think c++ without templates would be pretty manageable comparatively. For example because C++ has constructors and they don't quite mix well with templates you suddenly end up in the situation that you have 2 concepts: \"normal\" template argument deduction and constructor template argument deduction (CTAD). Because of this asymmetry you need a custom language feature called \"deduction guides\" to maneuver yourself out of the problems that come from this.Or another short one: std::expected without something like the \"!\" that rust has. You end up with endless \"if(result.has_value()) { return result; }\" cascades and it's horribly unergonomic.

For a vector of size N, that's up to N+1 allocations (allowing for the possibility that std::string uses the small string optimization).Granted, std::string doesn't have to allocate when copied if it's a \"copy on write\" implementation. IIRC, there were some implementations that used that technique when c++03 was the latest, but I don't think there are any that still do, due to other problems with COW.In modern c++, that same vector resizing operation requires exactly one allocation (for the new vector storage), because all the strings can be moved from the old storage to the new.Yes, you could have a vector of pointers to std::string, but now you've got yet another allocation (and indirection on access) for every string. In practice that tradeoff almost never makes sense, unless perhaps the strings have shared ownership (e.g. vector<shared_ptr<string>>).Ultimately, I think there's really no question that the vector resizing optimization described above is useful in certain scenarios.

Ferrite has three modes:- Rendered mode — Click-to-edit rendered Markdown (closest to WYSIWYG)- Split view — Raw editor + live preview side-by-side- Raw mode — Plain text editingIt's not pure \"type and it formats inline\" like Typora or Confluence. The Rendered mode lets you click elements to edit them, but it's not seamless WYSIWYG yet.If you're looking for true inline WYSIWYG, Typora is probably closest.

On my screen, breezy weather is able to show me the forecast for the next 5h until I scroll - this is OK, but it's annoying. The hours are very spaced apart, and there is a 1h resolution. With tighter spacing and 2h resolution, 12 or 16 hours could be displayed at once - which is far more likely to cover the time I am going to spend outside, which as the article states, is the main reason why I might want to check an hourly forecast anyway.All the other android apps mentioned here have the same issue.I might try to open an issue in their GH, or even a PR...

I believe DarkSky had the same feedback feature but I never needed it this much.Most of the time AW is fine but it’s less good to the point I’ve considered alternatives.",

      "abstract": "该讨论围绕iCloud照片下载的困难展开。用户普遍认为苹果的照片管理系统过于复杂，特别是iCloud照片的批量下载和备份存在诸多不便。有人指出，仅靠复制文件无法完整保留相册、实况照片、编辑记录等元数据状态，这给数据迁移带来挑战。也有用户提到，苹果的“优化存储”功能难以关闭，且文件命名规则在超过9999张后会导致重复，增加了管理难度。\n\n在解决方案上，讨论中出现了不同观点。部分用户推荐使用第三方工具如Photos Backup Anywhere、Parachute或PhotoSync来简化下载流程；但也有用户对非官方工具的安全性表示担忧，建议谨慎处理iCloud凭证。此外，对于专业格式（如实况照片）的导出是否无损存在分歧，一些用户认为现有导出方式可能导致画质损失。\n\n共识在于，用户希望拥有更自主、透明的照片管理方式，避免被单一生态系统锁定。尽管不少人欣赏iCloud的回忆等功能，但高昂的长期存储费用和封闭的系统设计促使他们寻求外部备份方案。",

Albums, Live Photos (paired assets), bursts, slo-mo, edits, and even “simple” things like adjusted capture dates are all tracked separately, and most export/backup tools end up flattening or partially reconstructing that on restore.The approach I took was to treat Photos as the source of truth and verify restored items against it, rather than assuming filesystem metadata is enough. As far as I know, this is the only tool that restores albums and correctly round-trips all Photos item types while preserving location data, creation dates, and modification dates when restoring back into Photos.Project page is here if it’s useful:\nhttps://photosbackup.app/Happy to explain details if anyone’s curious — there are a lot of sharp edges in Photos once you go beyond “export originals”.",

That’s very much the long tail of personal media.I’m not ready to pay $60/month, but I do like iCloud’s memories and other photo features. My compromise is simple:- I use docker-icloudpd to download our iCloud Photos to local storage over time. It’s been the most practical way I’ve found to back up multiple accounts into one place, though it does require occasional re-auth every so often.\n- I keep only the last ~2 years of media in iCloud and delete older ones after they’re archived locally.\n- For browsing and searching the older archive, I use Immich, which has been a great self-hosted personal photo cloud experience with a modern app feel.For storage, I’ve found fast local disk matters a lot once you’re digging up photos from 5+ years ago. Something like an OWC 4M2 with M.2 drives keeps the experience snappy; a typical HDD-based NAS can feel sluggish when you just want to quickly pull up an old memory.https://github.com/boredazfcuk/docker-icloudpd",

Starting as an active member of the general community, you talk an existing developer into being your mentor and fill out an open book test ( https://projects.gentoo.org/comrel/recruiters/quizzes/ebuild... ) which later is graded/corrected in a couple of meetings which I'd equate to the \"job interview\". I wish more open source projects (including my own) had such well-documented, straightforward processes to gain commit access.

I applaud the risque team for having achieved parity with amd64 for the @system set. This proves that the meta-distribution model is the only scalable way to handle the explosion of hardware diversity we are seeing post 2025. If you are building an embedded platfrm or working on custom silicon, Gentoo is a top tier choice. You cross-compile the stage1 and portage handles the rest.",

I feel like a staged/graduated (downloading/running precompiled initially while a flag-optimized compile runs in the background) would be a good way to get around some of the downsides here (namely that it takes 45 minutes to install firefox with emerge/pacman and that builds fail more often than packages fail to install).Very cool to see that it's still going strong - I remember managing many machines at scale was a bit of a challenge, especially keeping ahead of vulnerabilities.",

          "content": "TLDR: Installation is a pain, initial configuration is a pain and there's always something more to tweak, update is a lesser pain, but still a pain. But it's fun, BDSM-style...Installation is done by booting a liveCD, manually partitioning your storage, unpacking a Gentoo STAGE3 archive, chrooting in it, doing basic configuration such as network, timezone, portage (package manager) base profile and servers, etc., compiling and installing a kernel and then rebooting into the new system.Then you get to play with /etc/portage/make.conf which is the root configuration of the package manager. You get to set CPU instruction sets (CPU_FLAGS), gcc CFLAGS flags, MAKE flags, video card targets, acceptable package licenses, global USE flags (those are simplified ./configure arguments that usually apply to several packages), which Apache modules get built, which qemu targets get built, etc. These are all env vars that portage (the package manager) uses to build packages for your system.The more you use Gentoo, the more features of make.conf you discover. Never ending fun.Then, you start installing packages and updates (same procedure):1) You start the update by reviewing USE flags for each added/updated package - several screens of dense text.For example, PHP has these USE flags: https://packages.gentoo.org/packages/dev-lang/php - mouse hover to see what they do. You get to play with them in /etc/portage/package.use and there's no end to tweaking them.If you have any form of OCD, stay away from Gentoo or this will be your poison forever!2) Then the compilation begins and that takes hours or days depending on what you install and uses a lot of CPU and either storage I/O or memory (if you have lots of memory, you can compile in a tmpfs a lot faster).I'm not sure it is OK to compile the updates on a live server, especially during busy hours, but Gentoo has alternatives, including binary packages (recently added, but must match your USE flags with theirs), building packages remotely on another system (distcc), even on a different arch (crossdev). You could run an ARM server and build packages for it on a x86 workstation. I didn't use \"steve\", so I can't tell you what wonderful things that tool can do, yet.3) Depending on architecture, some less used packages may fail to compile. You get to manually debug that and submit bug reports. You can also add patches to /etc/portage/patches/<package> that will automatically be applied when the package is built, and that includes the kernel.I recommend you to run emerge with --keep-going to have the package manager continue after an error with the remaining packages.4) When each package is done compiling, it's installed automatically. There are no automatic reboots or anything. The files are replaced live, both executables and libraries. Running services continue to use old files from memory until you restart them or reboot manually - they will appear red/yellow in htop until you do.There were a few times, very very few, when I had crashes in new packages that were succesfuly built. It only happened on armv7, which is a practically abandoned platform everywhere. In those cases you can revert to the old ones and mask the bugged version to prevent it from being updated to next time.5) Last step is to review the config changes. dispatch-conf will present a diff of all proposed changes to .ini and .cfg files for all updated packages. You get to review, accept, reject the changes or manually edit the files.That's all. Simple. :)",

While the binary distributions were wrestling with the logistical nightmare of splitting repositories and figuring out the /lib64 vs /lib standard, Gentoo users just changed their CHOST, bootstrapped and were running 64-bit native. You nailed the psychology of it, too. The speed marketing was always a bit of a red herring. The ability to say \"I do not want LDAP support in my mail client\" and have the package manager actually respect that is cool. It respects the user's intelligence rather than abstracting it away.Since you've been on the ride since '04, I'm curious to hear your thoughts. How do you feel the maintenance burden compares today versus the GCC 3.x era? With the modern binhost fallback and the improvements in portage, I feel like we now spend less time fighting rebuild loops than back then? But I wonder if long time users feel the same.",

This is the wiki article [1] I used to set up most the portage side of things, it covers NFS as well.I use NFS to mount the container's /etc/portage to /mnt/portage and symlink the files to the Thinkpad's /etc/portage so I can cherry pick what I want to keep in sync with the build container. Don't have to mess with repos.conf either because portage will look to /var/cache/binpkgs by default.make.conf is a directory on both machines and has files like 01-common-flags.conf and 02-binhost-flags.conf. The Thinkpad has 01-common-flags.conf and 03-target-flags.conf with EMERGE_DEFAULT_OPTS=\"--with-bdeps=n --usepkgonly\" set, so running emerge -avuDN on the Thinkpad will only update with binaries from the mounted /var/cache/binpkgs. I keep the software in sync by using /etc/portage/sets instead of the world file. Then all the package.* dirs are symlinks as well.The Thinkpad binhost is a znver3, so the build container has CFLAGS=\"--march=x86-64-v3 --mtune=alderlake\" set. There's some SIMD extensions that two don't have in common and it has to build code that runs on both machines, otherwise you could use the target architecture in --march. Using the --mtune option in my case apparently sets the L2 cache size of the produced code to that of the Intel chip.Systemd-nspawn containers are super easy to spin up, as you basically install Gentoo from stage3 and it works like a chroot but with a full init. I run updates irregularly, there's still some manual effort for maintenance, but it's mostly just kicking off emerge and letting it build in a tmux session.[1] https://wiki.gentoo.org/wiki/Binary_package_guide",

It is a strange place politically.I find it wild that the BBC never mentioned the most glaring underbelly of this:New Brunswicks most significant employer for the past 100 years is Irving Oil & Irving Paper and Irving Forestry. They are different arms of a privately held family-run business, run by the descendants of the original founder (whose records are not as public as a traded company), in charge of the main industries of the province. They owned every newspaper in the province, and are known to be adversarial to any community paper, starting new papers just to drive out of business the small upstarts they don't own -- I've seen it play out in my community. People are literally afraid to criticize this family publicly, because they fund SO MUCH of the nonprofit sector. If you are trying to get a project off the ground, you can't look sideways at them or your project will be buried. And their papers certainly won't speak kindly of your criticism.And most glaringly, one of their ex-Vice Presidents was premier of the province during this time.So there is an extra level of concern that some locals have about the optics of the province shutting down the research.The Irving family is highly manipulative of political affairs, and imho have held the province back for decades (e.g. influencing what schools get funded/built, to create the working stock that support their businesses, etc)",

A confident diagnosis can be made only after examining brain tissue under a microscope.Prions are an unusual type of mis-folded protein that induce other proteins to take on a similar mis-folded shape when they come into contact with them. The mis-folded shape of the prion itself is what causes the mis-folding in adjacent proteins. It’s a chemical-bonding thing at the molecular level. It’s the shape of the prion that causes other proteins to take on a similar shape and become prions, etc.Some prion diseases occur spontaneously (when a protein takes on a mis-folded configuration due to mis-transcription or random energetic impulses) and some are transmitted, typically by eating some part of an animal that contains prions, which then end up in your own body, inducing proteins in your body to take on prion configurations.Prion diseases are the only known transmissible diseases that do not involve the replication of a pathogen’s genetic material in a host cell. The only known prion diseases affect nervous tissues, and in humans the only known prion diseases affect brain tissues.I’m not an expert on prion diseases, but I’ve had a bit of a fascination with them since having to report on a bunch of USDA surveillance lectures on mad-cow disease (bovine spongiform encephalopathy, BSE) and to summarize a bunch of symposia on prion diseases in a previous life. The symptoms reported in the article sound very much like a  prion disease, and the tests for CJD indicate that the doctors in the region suspect as much.But we simply don’t have good tests for prion diseases in vivo. And prion diseases are not well understood in general, so it wouldn’t be surprising that a new one would present as something of a mystery.It is also the case that I know very little about New Brunswick, but I will mention that prion diseases in humans are thought to be far more commonly acquired than spontaneous. The most common cause of acquisition is  eating animals with endemic prion diseases; this is most often nervous tissue of venison, but rarely nervous tissue of cattle infected with BSE, which is present in Canada more than anywhere else (by a small margin).It is also possible (but not likely) that a prion disease can arise de novo.0. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prion_disease",

They arrived in a taxi that was blanked for the day (it turned out the man was a cab driver) and after looking the place over and liking it visibly the woman said 'oh, we really like it, but there is one more thing, I am allergic to electromagnetic radiation so let me verify that' (eye roll by the man at this point). She went to the car and came back with a box with a dial on it that she had bought online (a pretty basic field strength meter, set to the most sensitive part of the range) and started walking around muttering to herself and waving the box around like a modern day dowser.After a while of this she came to me and said she was really sorry but she had to drop her interest because the house was absolutely infested with EM fields. In Amsterdam, where they lived, they had turned their whole apartment into a cage of Faraday with copper mesh nailed against every surface (it turned out they lived right opposite the KPN microwave tower next to the RAI so maybe she even had a point, that thing featured multiple RF links beaming 100's of Watts on tight beam links between other such towers, at some point in the past these carried our long distance phone calls before fiber came along).I asked if I could see her box for a second and pointed it at the sun: the needle pegged instantly and she was most surprised, so I explained that what she is measuring is real, but so faint that the chances of any kind of interaction with her body are most likely delusional.Here the conversation abruptly ended...As for TFA: prions, the agents responsible for CJD are remarkably resilient and annoying and can make it through the foodchain across the digestive barrier and into the brain and even a single one of them can cause CJD.https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/creutzfeldt-jakob-disease-cjd/",

Naturally that also occurs with other sources of infection, and factors including intoxication due to drugs (prescribed or otherwise) and a host of others. Vulnerability to such decompensation is greater among those already functioning marginally. As such accurate diagnosis can be hard to establish particularly when multiple factors are implicated, hardly a rare circumstance. (At least in my physician-practice that's  frequently been the case.)I appreciate your comment pointing to the importance of carefully evaluating individuals manifesting new onset delusional ideation or other \"mental\" disturbance. It might be associated with an obscure condition, but likely enough it's the result of common maladies. The worst error is thinking one knows what's going on before (or not at all) thoroughly investigating the possibilities.",

I love fly-replay combined with super fast start-up.I've been thinking a lot about how to run agents (and skills) securely while giving them a lot of powerful capabilities.I recently used their macaroons library to turn arbitrary API keys (e.g. for stripe's API) into macaroons. I route requests for an upstream host (like stripe) through Envoy as a mitm proxy which injects the real creds after verifying the macaroon.It is such a powerful pattern. I'm always worried about leaking sensitive keys through prompt injection attacks (or just sending them to anthropic), but in this model you can attenuate the keys (both capabilities & validity window) client side. The Envoy proxy lives inside my flycast network so it can't be accessed externally.It would be so cool if fly built something like this into sprites.dev (though I can see how it would be spooky to have fly install their own certs for stripe, etc...)",

I’m not really aware of what everyone else is doing with sandboxes etc.But the bit at the end with the MDM server made it click for me. I’ve started generating tiny iOS apps for personal software stuff, because they solve data storage better than the web (at least on iOS). A database on some other server seems like a bad fit/overkill for this stuff, client side storage is too flaky because Safari. But iOS apps are limiting in their own annoying ways compared to web apps.This looks like a really interesting solution, I can just store the data on a sprite with SQLite or whatever. Visit its URL to use my app, then does it go away on its own after a short time? I could have done that before with a server with storage, but this seems easier/probably cheaper.If this works well/the way I’m hoping it might be the sweet spot for simple personal software that needs persistent data and you want to run anywhere.One feature that would make this really nice is if it could have something like Vercel preview environments, where I need to auth my fly account to view the URL.

Would be interesting to hear more about the underlying design choices and trade-offs.Edit: from their website, \"Since it's just ext4, you won't run into weird edge cases like you might with NFS or FUSE mounts. You can happily use shared memory files, for example, so you can run SQLite in all its modes.\" So it's a virtio block device supporting discard that's exposed to the VM.

Usual caveats, and I'm only running them on my own phone. I ask Claude (not code) to help me with the spec, I give it some bullet points and it asks a bunch of clarifying questions then gives me a spec.

Given AI's peak demand is extremely spiky they end up with low utilization numbers for API support.Your subscription is supposed to use that free capacity. Hence, the token costs are not that high, hence you could buy that. But it needs careful management that you dont overload the system. There is a claude code telemetry which identifies the request as lower priority than API (and probably decide on queueing + caching too). If your harness makes 10 parallel calls everytime you query, and not manage context as well as claude code, its overwhelming the system, degrading the performance for others too. And if everyone just wants to use subscription and you have no api takers, the price of subscription is not sustainable anyway. In a way you are relying on others' generosity for the cheap usage you get.Its reasonable for a company to unilaterally decide how they monetize their extra capacity, and its not unjustified to care.

But it needs careful management that you dont overload the system. There is a claude code telemetry which identifies the request as lower priority than API (and probably decide on queueing + caching too). If your harness makes 10 parallel calls everytime you query, and not manage context as well as claude code, its overwhelming the system, degrading the performance for others too. And if everyone just wants to use subscription and you have no api takers, the price of subscription is not sustainable anyway. In a way you are relying on others' generosity for the cheap usage you get.I understand what you mean but outright removing the ability for other agents to use the claude code subscription is still really harshIf telemetry really is a reason (Note: I doubt it is, I think the marketing/lock-ins aspect might matter more but for the sake of discussion, lets assume so that telemetry is in fact the reason)Then, they could've simply just worked with co-ordination with OpenCode or other agent providers.

Extraordinary claims require extraordinary proof.Ars cites this China Daily article[0], which gives no specifics and simply states:  >A LiDAR unit, for instance, used to cost 30,000 yuan (about $4,100), but now it costs only around 1,000 yuan (about $138) — a dramatic decrease, said Li.\n\nHow good are these $138 LiDARs? Who knows, because this article gives no information.This article[1] from around the same time gives more specifics, listing under \"1000 yuan LiDARs\" the RoboSense MX, Hesai Technology ATX, Zvision Technologies ZVISION EZ5, and the VanJee Technology WLR-760.The RoboSense MX is selling for $2,000-3,000, so it's not exactly $138. It was going to be added to XPENG cars, before they switched away from LiDAR. Yikes.The ATX is $1400, the EZ5 isn't available, and the WLR-760 is $3500. So the press release claims of sub-$200 never really materialized.Furthermore, all of these are low beam count LiDARs with a limited FOV. These are 120°x20°, whereas Waymo sensors cover 360°x95° (and it still needs 4 of them).It seems my initial skepticism was well placed.  >if you had to choose one or the other for cost you’d be insane to choose vision over lidar\n\nGood luck with that.

Create situations in a lab or take recordings from real drives, label them with the high-level information contained in them and train your models to extract it.

The whole library cost about £10.* Topics are organised into a tree structure using recursive Leiden partitioning and LLM labels. This gives a high-level sense of the themes.* There are several ways to browse. The most useful are embedding similarity, topic tree siblings, and topics cooccurring within a chunk window.* Everything is stored in SQLite and manipulated using a set of CLI tools.I wrote more about the process here: https://pieterma.es/syntopic-reading-claude/I’m curious if this way of reading resonates for anyone else - LLM-mediated or not.",

Then I simply averaged all chunks for a doc and wrote that single vector back to postgresql. Then I used UMAP + HDBScan to perform dimensionality reduction and clustering. I ended up with a 2D data set that I can plot with plotly to see my clusters. It is very cool to play with this. It takes hours to import 100 pdf files but I can take one folder that contains a mix of programming titles, self-help, math, science fiction etc. After the fully automated analysis you can clearly see the different topic clusters.I just spent time getting it all running on docker compose and moved my web ui from express js to flask.

I wish now I could remember the title and author. :(Anyway, it introduced me to the idea of using computational methods in the humanities, including literature. I found it really interesting at the time!One of the the terms it introduced me to is \"distant reading\", whose name mirrors that of a technique you may have studied in your gen eds if you went to university ('close reading\"). The idea is that rather than zooming in on some tiny piece of text to examine very subtle or nuanced meanings, you zoom out to hundreds or thousands of texts, using computers to search them for insights that only emerge from large bodies of work as wholes. The book argued that there are likely some questions that it is only feasible to ask this way.An old friend of mine used techniques like this for dissertation in rhetoric, learning enough Python along the way to write the code needed for the analyses she wanted to do. I thought it was pretty cool!I imagine LLMs are probably positioned now to push distant reading forward in an number of ways: enabling new techniques, allowing old techniques to be used without writing code, and helping novices get started with writing some code. (A lot of the maintainability issues that come with LLM code generation happily don't apply to research projects like this.)Anyway, if you're interested in other computational techniques you can use to enrich this kind of reading, you might enjoy looking into \"distant reading\": https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Distant_reading",

So, I thought, what if I had an LLM look through a list of kids books published in the 1990s and categorize \"is this a portal fantasy?\" and \"which category is the portal?\"I would 1. possibly find my book and 2. possibly find dozens of books I could add to the lists.

This would fit well with \"about a decade ago.\"2. *\"Graphs, Maps, Trees: Abstract Models for Literary History\"* (2005) — His earlier and very influential work that laid out the quantitative, computational approach to literary analysis, even if it didn't use \"distant reading\" as prominently in the title.Moretti, who founded the Stanford Literary Lab, was the major proponent of the idea that we should analyze literature not just through careful reading of individual canonical texts, but through large-scale computational analysis of hundreds or thousands of works—looking at trends in genre evolution, plot structures, title lengths, and other patterns that only emerge at scale.Given that the commenter specifically remembers learning the term \"distant reading\" from the book, my best guess is *\"Distant Reading\" (2013)*, though \"Graphs, Maps, Trees\" is also a strong possibility if their memory of \"a decade\" is approximate.",

When resizing the page, leave some flag of how it was allocated. This tagging is commonly done as the always 0 bits in size or address fields to save space.2. Since the pool is a known size of contiguous memory, check if the memory to be freed is within that range3. Make the size immutable.

This means Rust cares that for any value V of type T, Rust can see that we did not destroy V twice (or more often).With Linear Types the compiler checks that you destroyed V exactly once, not less and not more.However, one reason I don't end up caring about Leak Safety of this sort is that in fact users do not care that you didn't \"leak\" data in this nerd sense. In this nerd sense what matters is only leaks where we lost all reference to the heap data. But from a user's perspective it's just as bad if we did have the reference but we forgot - or even decided explicitly not - to throw it away and get back the RAM.The obvious way to make this mistake \"by accident\" in Rust is to have two things which keep each other alive via reference counting and yet have been disconnected and forgotten by the rest of the system. A typical garbage collected language would notice that these are garbage and destroy them both, but Rust isn't a GC language of course. Calling Box::leak isn't likely to happen by accident (though you might mistakenly believe you will call it only once but actually use it much more often)I think the main part of Ghostty's design mentioned here that - as a Rust programmer - I think is probably a mistake is the choice to use a linked list. To me this looks exactly like it needs VecDeque, a circular buffer backed by a growable array type. Their \"clever\" typical case where you emit more text and so your oldest page is scrapped and re-used to form your newest page, works very nicely in VecDeque, and it seems like they never want the esoteric fast things a linked list can do, nor do they need multi-writer concurrency like the guts of an OS kernel, they want O(1) pop & push from opposite ends. Zig's Deque is probably that same thing but in Zig.",

Looking at the memorypool, I think you're right that my assumption of it being a simple contiguous array was incorrect.ETA: I think I'm actually very wrong for #2.

      "abstract": "该HackerNews帖子围绕“毒药喷泉”这一概念展开讨论，核心话题是少量恶意样本能否污染大型语言模型的训练数据，以及“模型崩溃”是否构成现实威胁。讨论中提到，有用户认为模型崩溃被过度炒作，前沿实验室通过严格的数据筛选和后期强化学习已有效应对此问题，且当前大模型性能提升主要依赖训练后优化而非单纯扩大预训练数据。也有用户指出，公开“毒药”数据可能迫使研究者开发更先进的数据净化技术，反而推动AI发展。分歧点在于对数据污染风险的实际评估：一方认为主流实验室通过精细的数据策展和代理模型测试已能防范污染；另一方则担忧模型若持续使用合成数据或未经净化的网络数据，可能陷入错误放大的恶性循环。此外，有用户质疑相关报道的时效性，认为其未能反映当前业界的实际应对能力。讨论中普遍认同的是，数据质量管理和过滤技术对模型健康发展至关重要。",

The models are being fed on their own AI slop and synthetic data in an error-magnifying doom-loop known as \"model collapse.\"Model collapse is a meme that assumes zero agency on the part of the researchers.I'm unsure how you can have this conclusion when trying any of the new models. In the frontier size bracket we have models like Opus 4.5 that are significantly better at writing code and using tools independently. In the mid tier Gemini 3.0 flash is absurdly good and is crushing the previous baseline for some of my (visual) data extraction projects. And small models are much better overall than they used to be.",

Yes, model developers filter data... but poorly. Several examples showed trash data can make the cut into production and break something on the way.2. To be fair, filtering data poisons can be extremely challenging, even impossible. Simply because one cannot know how updating a model's weights influence its behaviour on all possible inputs.Once people will understand that even a tiny amount of data can slightly change models and still greatly change their behaviour, there will be a shift in AI security.",

Basically exactly what we expected for when we purchased premium support.We stuck with them when they brought their support back to the US. Each tech person wanted to make a career out of each ticket. We couldn't get broken hardware fixed without screaming and begging.Keep in mind, we always bought the best hardware with the most expensive support level. Precision laptops. Precision desktops.

Also standby actually works.We had done an initial batch of Dell Pro 16 laptops and with 16gb of ram + the 255h (now 258v) it's over $1100 a laptop.

The upgrade to 32gb of RAM moves the price to $1500+ each, they also recently swapped to soldered RAM for both Intel and AMD, so we are forced to the $1500+ option with a faster CPU.Initial reactions have been overwhelmingly positive, about 50% of them are new to Macs and have figured it out, additionally they all love the battery life and performance (most are switching from 11th and 12th gen Intel).Our more tech savvy members have mentioned the better screen, webcam and audio as positives.I am considering switching our call center (~200 members) to Mac mini's, the same price as our Lenovo mini PCs and will last a long time, the Core Ultra 210 is not great.

I'm not sure I can agree with all of the \"Dell computers are bad/dying\" arguments.I think they went through a huge quality slump from ~2020-2023, as did most things, but so far my experience has been that they're quite good now. I haven't had any standby issues (or issues of any kind, really) using Windows. Windows 11 is Windows 11 but Tahoe is also Tahoe so that's a net medium. A little bit of Group Policy tweaking to remove the junkware and a little wince when hit with new-Notepad aside, it's good enough. I also tried running Linux on it and everything was straightforward except for the webcam (most modern Intel laptops use a new Intel thing where the CPU has the ISP on it and the camera is attached over CSI, and the kernel support is quite bleeding-edge) and the usual Nvidia graphics switching and arcane Linux power management problems, but I really got it for Windows anyway.My only beefs are the terrible virtual function bar (this was stupid the first time vendors tried it, and trying it again in 2025 is a really incredible choice, I'm glad they backed down on this ludicrous idea) and that the OLED model only comes in touchscreen form and the digitizer is ever-so-slightly visible. Otherwise I like it as well as my M2 MacBook Pro; the screen is square and notchless, the performance-to-dollar ratio was far superior, and the physical build quality is quite good. The \"infinity\" touchpad that's not really infinite is a stupid gimmick on paper but overall I don't notice it at all - it works just as well as any non-Apple touchpad I've used, which is to say about 85% as well as an Apple one.",

I imagine that the casino versions of poker are not TXHT.By contrast, roulette is simply a game where the casino wins eventually with a fixed profit (thanks to 0 and a possible 00).

I came out £90 up, which was nice and my \"advisor\" came out £95 up (eventually, after being £200 down at one point).  Sadly my \"advisor\" ended up bankrupt a year later.So, how do you play a LLM?

          "content": "> How much of a session is based on \"reading players\" vs \"playing the odds\"?Several good answers here, but I will add my own take.“Playing the odds” is basically playing good, fundamental poker. This is a baseline that most players will use when sitting down at a table of unknown players. This is often called a “balanced” strategy (note some people erroneously call this “GTO strategy, assuming the balance, which is not actually what GTO is).“Reading players” is a thing, but it can be broken up into (at least) two categories: 1) physical tells, and 2) player habits.Physical tells is not a big thing. Some people give off a lot of tells, but some folks are also decent (not good) at giving reverse tells. Honestly, you can be a wildly successful poker player while knowing nothing about physical tells.(Side note: One of the most reliable tells is bet timing tells. This can sometimes even be a tell online, especially when people are taking shots at higher stakes or are deep in a tournament. It can also be faked, but some folks are super reliable with timing tells, and they don’t realize it.)The second kind of tell is player tendencies — things like when players play too many hands or when they play too few (e.g., fold too often).One very reliable way for good players to smooth out their earnings curve is figure out which players fold too often and in which spots. Once they’ve figured that out, they try to set up that spot and basically print low-risk (sometimes even no-risk) chips.Taking advantage of these tendencies is called an “exploitative” strategy (as opposed to the “balanced” strategy mentioned above).Really good players can take rec players on a journey through a series of emotions (and accompanying predictable gameplay) such that the good player can read the rec player like a book. The odds tip heavily in favor of the good player at this point.Pro player and strong amateur players are so far ahead of recs in ways that the recs don’t even realize.",

Perhaps in part due to modern engines being off-the-shelf ready to render high quality assets and assets being so available, either internally or from an asset store. It helped push developers into putting high quality assets into games from the start, skipping the \"grey box\" steps.I've had it on a number of projects now where high quality assets were pushed into early builds causing execs eyes to light up as they feel like they're seeing a near final product, blind to the issues and under developed systems below. This can start projects off on bad footing because expectations can quickly become skewed and focus can go to the wrong places.At one studio there was a running joke about trees swaying because someone had decorated an outdoor level with simulated trees. During an early test the execs got so distracted by how much they swayed and if it was too much or too little that they completely ignored the gameplay and content that was supposed to be under review. This issue repeated itself a number of times to the point where meetings would begin with someone declaring \"We are not here to review the trees, ignore the trees!\"I've brought this issue up more recently with the advent of AI, which with things like Sora, the act of creating video clips can be stitched together can look like subjectively exciting movie trailers. This now has people declaring that AI movies are around the corner. To me this looks like the similar level of excitement as seeing the trees sway.

Some terminal emulators get it right nearly all the time (e.g. Ghostty, which has had a lot of thought and effort put into getting it right) and yet there are still open issues in the Ghostty repo about inconsistent character width. There are just so many corner cases that it's hard.That said, the edge alignment is, I believe, caused by the fact that LLMs are involved in the process. Because the LLMs never \"see\" the final visual representation that humans see. Their \"view\" of the world is text-based, and in the text file, those columns line up because they have the same number of UTF-8 codepoints in the row. So the LLMs do not realize that the right edges are misaligned visually. (And since the workflow described is for an LLM to take that text file as input and produce an output in React/Vue/Svelte/whatever, the visual alignment of the text file needs to stay LLM-oriented for it to work properly. I assume, of course, since I haven't tried this myself).",

          "content": "> More of this, less AIThe comment was great without this part.I'm sorry I'm going to go on a rant, but seeing this day in and day out really gets to me.I'm a filmmaker. AI is an incredible tool that is making VFX affordable to those of us with budgets.My friends and I are already using it in roto/comp workflows:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tii9uF0nAx4https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tj-dJvGVb-whttps://drive.google.com/file/d/1m6eUR5V55QXA9p6SLuCM8LdFMBq... (NSFW, bloody/gory - the effects look bad because we did this for a \"film hackathon\" and had an extremely short amount of time with no chance to fix the editing, script, lack of locations, etc. Under four hours for the VFX work.)Corridor Crew are making incredible stuff and teaching people how to do it:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DSRrSO7QhXYhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GVT3WUa-48Yhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iq5JaG53dhoThere's so much use by actual artists. I don't have a list in front of me, but I'll start compiling that to share next time this comes up.I am really salty about this because I am receiving hate and death threats because of this. I've had a film of mine booed in a live theater because I worked on a Blender + Mocap + AnimateDiff short film. I'm deep in the Atlanta film scene. I know a lot of the people that were in the audience personally. This was fresh off of the strikes, and the looming AI fears had people worried, so I understood the apprehension. But it still sucks to have your hard work and labor shunned like that in person. In any case, I won an award for that film. A year later, I did the same thing and everyone clapped. (It's not in my portfolio. I left a link in one of my previous comments if you care to dig.)It's super easy to say \"AI sucks\", \"AI bros\", \"kill AI artist\", etc., but it misses all of the hard work being done by those using the tools.I one day hope to have our small studio making high fantasy and science fiction films. I covet the art direction of Denis Villeneuve and Peter Jackson. I always have. My director friends that went to film school hoped to make films like that when they were younger, as I did I. The industry is very pyramid shaped, and unless you get really lucky or have nepo baby connections, you'll never get the chance to helm a project like that.Tens of thousands of students go to film school every year, yet most of their dreams wither on the vine. That's incredibly sad. We only get a small slice of human creativity, and what we do see is usually pretty generic.We have our Arris - that part has been democratized for a while. We have distribution. But we could never afford a $100 million VFX budget. AI changes the game and gives us so much hope that we can finally tell the stories we really want to tell in the way that we want to tell them.Instead of thinking of AI as \"just prompting\", think of it as an exoskeleton for practitioners. One analogy is that cameras can be used by anyone to make all kinds of junk - selfies, food pics, \"butt dialed\" accidental shots. Yet professional photographers are capable of making incredibly captivating art and immortalizing Pulitzer Prize winning moments.There are AI coding assistants for people who can't code (and I think this is awesome for accessibility and letting people act on their dreams - it's a gateway!), and there are AI coding models for full-time engineers. It's a lot like that.I've made a lot of experiments in this space. Huge ComfyUI workflows, custom trained models frankensteined from stitched together modules, a lot of Unreal and Blender-inspired work.I'm currently working on this [1] to enhance my own work. My desire right now is making it really fast to visually mold starting frames (which are like a director and DP blocking out scenes before shooting) and to precisely get the image you want before generating it.This year I'm going to make full AI animations as well as a bunch of rotoscoped human + AI films this year. This stuff is going to be amazing for horror, sci-fi, and fantasy with live human actors. Those low-budget Blumhouse films are about to get real, and we're going to start seeing Lovecraftian horrors and actually good dinosaur movies soon. I'm really excited for this.So I guess to return to my point, please please please don't hate all AI or especially insult people using it. This technology isn't distributed evenly, and in some pockets it's literally the most magical thing to have happened to the space. I wish I had this when I was much younger - my career would have looked a lot different. I'm really happy for the kids that get to grow up using this.--Anyway, I came to this article because I love Smash. It's a fantastic article and the author did an amazing job compiling this. I mostly play \"no items\", but I did see these on rare occasions. It's funny how nostalgia can be triggered by low resolution billboard textures from Melee.Sakurai, director of the game, is bullish on AI for game development [2]. I think he's thinking the same way we are - this is a creative exoskeleton letting us do more and achieve more of our vision against the friction of constraints.Invariably the comments (probably from non-artist consumers?) is full of hate. Many artists want to use this, yet we're bullied and hated for it.This one, jeez:> Dude's a hack and hasn't made a good game since Melee.This is the same bullshit I'm getting on a daily basis. \nThe hate we get online is unreal. You have to see it to believe it. I'm talking death threats on a regularly recurring basis. I should blog about it.So please internalize this plea. Whenever you see attacks like this, please say something to remind the other person that we're all human and that real artists are using these tools to make real art.[1] https://github.com/storytold/artcraft[2] https://www.resetera.com/threads/masahiro-sakurai-believes-g...",

Developers want to know where they should focus their time and where they can afford to skim over the documentation.

The more clearly the user understands the documentation the more useful the documentation will be during the time where the user is experiencing the most confusion.The danger is the temptation to simplify the information contained within the documentation to such an extent that the user is left with a large amount of missing information and no method for seeking assistance with incomplete information.What situations have you encountered where the information contained within short technical documentation has been more helpful than official technical documentation? ~",

          "content": "I looked into this a bit and I am also skeptical about the leak narrative.I just checked, and Instagram’s password reset flow allows requesting a reset using an email address, a phone number, or even the username [1]. The username is public information, so triggering password reset emails is relatively easy. At scale you would need IP rotation and some basic automation, but it is not particularly hard to generate a large volume of reset emails and create confusion.From an attacker’s perspective, this does not grant access to accounts or sensitive data. It mainly causes users to receive unexpected reset emails and possibly panic or change their passwords. That aligns more with nuisance or malice than with a meaningful breach.I do not have definitive proof, but based on this behavior it seems plausible that the reported wave of reset emails could be explained without any large scale data leak.[1] https://www.instagram.com/accounts/password/reset/ (screenshot: https://imgur.com/a/4x5HPLx)",

Probably because for a security company it's a quick win finding such a \"breach\" you can generate publicity with and/or scare clueless executives into buying your solution/consultancy services. I think there was a similar \"breach\" at Twitter where it turns out it was all publicly-available data users themselves put on their public profile that was scraped.I've personally had people argue with me that disclosing whether an account was registered was a major breach and do \"something\" about it, yet refuse to change the registration form to also not disclose that fact (since otherwise we'd have to move the registration process behind an emailed link and ask the user to wait for the confirmation email to continue, killing conversion rates).The \"something\" was done, and of course the bad guys promptly moved onto the signup form.

          "content": "One thing I'm curious about is I hear stories about people getting hacked and losing their FB/IG/Tiktok accouts then fighting to get them back. You never hear details but I can only assume they're reusing passwords or they're using guessable passwords. For reference, anything 10 characters or less has to be viewed as guessable in this day and age.I've long-viewed password managers are mandatory. Every site get its own 20+ character randomly generated password. I don't care if the hash gets leaked. It's not getting cracked. For years this has been 1Password. Initially it was LastPass but 1Password is just more slick.The annoyance is all the arbitrary rules sites create about you have to use special characters or you can't or they have different, non-overlapping requirements on password length or the absolute worst is forced password rotation.I don't generally try and get non-tech friends and family use password managers however because it's still kinda clunky to use and generate. Passkeys are kinda better I guess? But they're far from universal and I don't expect them ever to be.Anyway, this kind of leak from Meta kinda surprises me. Leaking information that ties a physical address to an email address? That's a massive breach and not normally one you expect form a company employing thousands of engineers.I will say this: IG operates as its own domain within Meta and AFAIK they still use a completely separate code base in Python/Django. Facebook proper is in Hack (almost entirely) and has excellent tooling and systems to detect weak endpoints and PII leaks of this sort such that leaky endpoints (or however this information leaked; I didn't see any details in the article) really just don't happen.This has long been a point of friction within Meta engineerings. It's defensible to say it's not worth rewriting but IG are constantly playing catch up with what the rest of the company gets for \"free\". How many billion+ dollar settlements does it take before this equation changes?And yes I believe that leaking physical addresses is going to cost th ecompany more than a billion dollars. It may get people killed. That's how serious this is.",

I don't know the password reset process for Instagram, but maybe a similar thing could be happening that people assumed is behind the Amazon wave:Amazon sends you a 6-digit code to reset your password. The code is valid for five minutes before a new one is generated. I don't know what the rate limit is, but even if you can just try five times within those five minutes, your chance of guessing it right would be 1 in 200,000. Now assume the attackers are running this on several million accounts in parallel, and you can assume they'd be able to steal a few accounts just with lucky guesses.It worried me enough that I removed my phone number from my account, through which the password reset requests were initiated. The absolute risk for each user may be low, but overall it seems like a terrible system with regards to security.",

Much of the science about lighting, physics, and rendering we take for granted today was mostly unknown; developers just did the best they could with the basic tech that was available. Back then, just the fact that we could put thousands of hardware accelerated textured polygons on the screen was a miracle to us.While Max Payne was cutting-edge, a lot of what made the visuals appear impressive was due to hand-tweaking by a team of highly skilled artists and designers, who were probably using ridiculously primitive tooling. Pretty much every realistic 3D game of this era had to make do with low-res diffuse textures, prebaked lighting, mostly fixed-function rendering, pre-scripted interactions, and particle dynamics that were basically just a few lines of C++. Other early-2000's games like Serious Sam, Halo, and Metroid Prime also managed to create immersive visuals with very limited tech, using the same techniques as Max Payne.",

I had not had a console since the Nintendo 64 came out. I booted Halo and was literally mesmerized when I came out of a tunnel onto the Halo and saw the sky and the landmass. I can still remember that afternoon 20+ years later. Bought an Xbox the next morning.Current game devs, especially in the AAA space, spend a lot of time and effort looking for hyper realism and embracing new tech to achieve accurate PBR. I wonder whether the limitations of the older hardware force a more artistic stance on everyone, even down to technical artists, to embrace an art style and art direction and work to achieve attractiveness vs realism. Or I could just be seeing my early 20’s through rose-tinted glasses.",

The fact that there are still polygonal barrels is likely mostly about what things to prioritize.The Holy Grail of real-time rendering is probably micropolygons – the ability to render the whole scene using polygons a fraction of the size of a single output pixel, something that off-line renderers like Pixar's RenderMan have done since the early 90s. There are reasons why GPUs are not very good at rendering a lot of extremely small polygons, leading to approaches such as Epic's Nanite virtualized geometry in Unreal Engine 5 which basically implements a software renderer running on GPU compute shaders.",

Is it done by the same person in a tight loop or did it involve hand-ofs, etc.The excellence of the result is down to a lot of tasteful choices in how to blend these techniques, achieved either from experience or iteration.As programmers we tend to focus a lot on the raw rendering techniques, but there's a whole systematic practice around art direction and how to achieve and maintain quality in it that feels I guess softer and less deterministic but is still worth talking at length about.This especially struck me when the reviewer here recommended using multiple stacked texture planes and parallax mapping to improve things. I know a handful of games that have done this, and unless used exceedingly sparingly (e.g. mesh fence over pipes or something, where the foreground isn't expected to have a lot of depth) in my experience it very quickly gives away the illusion and looks very hokey. Humans are good at telling it's planes sliding over each other and doesn't correspond to their experience with depth perception. It also makes a scene a lot busier as the camera is moved, firing \"something is changing here!\" perceptual sinals all over the screen (note how all the lavish particle effects are about feedback instead), and is not the atmosphere Max Payne was trying to achieve.In other words, sometimes it's about knowing what possible thing not to do, too.

They only recently added support for foliage. So you'd use SDF / Nanite for your \"infinite detail\" / kit-bashing individual pebbles all the way to the horizon, and then draw polygon characters and props on top of that.In fact I was surprised to see that Nanite flipped from triangle supremacy to using voxels in their new foliage tech.

But having used coding agents for complex software work, and games being one of the most complex software tasks in the industry, I just don't see it happening quite that easily.I also think the outcome would be shit, pure and simple. The development of a game is usually the stylistic input of dozens to thousands of humans over the course of years. They are not trivial pursuits.

It’s harder because the distance evaluations get much more expensive when you attach a hierarchy of warps and transforms, and there are typically a lot of distance evaluations when doing ray-marching. This project reduces the cost by using a voxel cache, but animated stuff thwarts the caching, so you have to limit the amount of animation.  Another reason it’s more difficult to rig & animate SDFs is because you only get a limited set of shapes that have analytic distance functions, or you have primitives and blending and warping that break Lipschitz conditions in your distance field, which is a fancy way of saying it’s easy to break the SDF and there are only limited and expensive ways to fix it.
