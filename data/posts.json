      "abstract": "该讨论围绕Cloudflare因意大利罚款事件引发的争议展开。核心话题是Cloudflare CEO对意大利罚款的回应，包括威胁退出意大利市场并停止提供免费网络安全服务。社区观点呈现明显分歧。\n\n有人认为意大利法律定义模糊，但也指出美国视角存在问题，认为当前互联网自由言论体系导致了有害内容的泛滥。有用户批评CEO向JD Vance求助的做法，认为这暴露了其商业模式类似“保护费”性质，并提及过去与安全研究员的不愉快事件。讨论中提到，部分用户对CEO在罚款后才抱怨法律表示不满，认为其立场不够真诚。\n\n也有用户指出，CEO讨好美国政府的姿态可能适得其反，会加剧欧洲对Cloudflare的反感。同时，有观点认为Cloudflare退出意大利可能有利于欧盟数字主权，但讽刺地指出其作为TLS终端服务商实则为美国情报机构提供了便利。关于罚款原因，讨论中提到这可能与打击非法体育直播（尤其是足球）有关，类似情况在西班牙等国也存在。\n\n共识方面，多数用户对CEO的处理方式和政治表态持批评态度，但对其提出的法律争议本身未形成统一看法。",

In Europe we are under daily attack from Russian accounts that spread massive amounts of desinformation, deep fakes, just emotional appeals with the goal of destroying liberal democracy. The US government is actively trying to support them by fighting against any kind of European rules and spreading their part of desinformation.This is not about normal politics, Europe is under siege.",

Its not the first time he does this, and certainly it won't be the last. This communication style gets old fast, and IMO this actually hurts the company - I'm a free tier user and would never subscribe any paid products. I think their tech is amazing, they surely have great engineers, but I don't feel comfortable financing a company that thinks it is above the law.The icing on the cake is the plea for a free internet; You know what a free internet looks like? A network that doesn't make half its content inaccessible because someone in a major company did a mistake on a SQL query. Or a network that isn't controlled by a company that basically just said \"we're tight with the US government, so f** your laws\".",

He is applying whatever pressure that Cloudflare can apply on its own (not much), and he mentions Vance as a way to call for US administration help at a time when the US is entering an open economic conflict with Europe.

I support CF’s fight to keep the internet open against encroaching EU regulation while also acknowledging that the US has been a recurring bad actor here.

For context, the \"Piracy Shield\" mentioned in the order is basically a legislative hacksaw authorized by the regulator (AGCOM) primarily to protect Serie A football rights.

It’s infamous locally for false positives—it has previously taken down Google Drive nodes and random legitimate CDNs just because they shared an IP with a pirate stream.The NUCLEAR threat regarding the 2026 Winter Olympics (Milano-Cortina) is the real leverage here. He’s bypassing the regulator and putting a gun to the government’s head regarding national prestige and infrastructure security.My personal take idea likely outcome: Cloudflare wins.EU Law: The order almost certainly violates the Digital Services Act (DSA) regarding general monitoring obligations and country-of-origin principles.\nRealpolitik: The Italian government can't risk the Olympics infrastructure getting DDoS'd into oblivion because AGCOM picked a fight they can't win.

Given that phones are the default computing device for most people these days and how (relatively) easily secrets can be extracted from rooted devices, blanket-banning them makes a lot of sense.Nonetheless, modern Android is just as locked down as modern iOS, with a few exceptions (like adb access) and without the awesome hardware and software optimizations for that hardware that make video recording fast and web browsing even faster.

Oh, and conveniently, they charge a fee for developers to use this \"service,\" and take a percentage of what the developer earns by selling software on their \"service.\" And somehow in the late 2000s early 2010s, it just became normalized, and somehow the term for being able to install software on a device you supposedly own became a scary term, \"jailbreak.\"Granted, jailbreaking was often used for piracy, but the fact that there needed to be a process at all confounds me.My mom has an iPhone and she manages to install a bunch of weird things on her phone, like anti-virus software that almost certainly don't scan for viruses, but are all too happy to take your money to make your phone more secure. These are things that the App Store \"service\" should have guarded against if they were indeed doing their jobs and protecting consumers from bad software.And, I wouldn't be surprised if she'd be locked out of her banking app eventually because [insert entity here] deems her phone too old to update her banking app. She's \"following the rules\" and still getting screwed over.",

Back then, cars were central identitarian elements to the post-war, western promise of salvation. Whole cities were torn down and rebuild to fit the car. The car had ideological significance. I think, identitarian attachment to the car is actually less today, but due to the historic importance and focus, cars have become unconditional necessities in many places.I think the reason, you frequently see \"old cars as tools\" in southern Europe still, is the fact most regions there only started industrialization after 1970 and were/are still greatly underdeveloped/relatively poor, compared to eg. early industrialized nations like Germany, which are super car-centric. They suffered less car adaptation at the time and as a consequence e.g. SUVs would be rather impractical in some places with extremely narrow streets. Additionally, (remaining) farmers in e.g. Germany are almost exclusively rather rich entrepreneurs managing industrialized food production on flat, boring lands, than \"poor peasants\" caring for traditional farms in remote villages living off tourism somewhere pretty.Probably less due to zeitgeist/mentality, but rather geography, historic economic abilities and availability.",

But when we talk about cars that are made for the consumer, all sanity goes out the window, we get these near-caricatures that would be hilarious if they weren't real. The craziness can only be somewhat tamed by government restrictions, depending on where you live, but the peak of this design results in huge, elevated flat boxes for engine compartments, mounted as high as possible. It doesn't matter that the driver has a blind spot in every direction, what matters is showing off how HUGE your 18L V32 engine must surely be under that hood, how powerful it must be to draw air through that chrome grille that's half a person's height, and most importantly, how much of an imposing heroic warrior one must be to own that tank.",

Many have commercial versions of their vehicles, especially trucks and vans, that are stripped down.The stripped down base models don't sell well.Remember how the internet was clamoring for an iPhone Mini? Whenever there were complaints about modern cell phones, you could find what looked like unanimous agreement that a smaller iPhone would be the golden ticket. Then Apple made an iPhone Mini, and it did not sell well.The same happens with vehicles. Whenever you find threads complaining about modern vehicles it seems unanimous that modern vehicles have too many things consumers don't want and we'd be better off with simple base models. Yet simple base models do exist already and they don't sell well. Real consumers look at their $20,000 Nissan Versa and realize that spending an extra $1-2K on amenities isn't going to change their monthly payment much.There is a lot of precedent for this. The Tata Nano was an Indian micro car that was small, low-power, and had bare minimum amenities.

          "content": "I've been running desktop Linux for about eighteen years, though I did take a break and run a Macbook for about four years.It's a little upsetting that Windows has gotten so terrible, because I think in a lot of ways the NT Kernel is a better piece of software than the Linux kernel.   Drivers are simply easier to install and they generally don't require a reboot and they don't require messing with kernel modules, IO is non-blocking by default, and a bunch of other things that are cool and arguably better than Linux.The problem is that, while the kernel is an important part of an operating system, it's not the only part.  Even if the NT kernel were the objectively best piece of software ever to be written by humans, that still doesn't change the fact that Windows has become a pretty awful mess. They have loaded the OS with so much crap (and ads now!), the Windows Update tool routinely breaks your computer, their recovery/repair tools simply do not work, their filesystem is geriatric and has been been left behind compared to stuff like ZFS, btrfs, and APFS, and they don't really seem determined to fix any of this stuff.Even if the Linux kernel were to be slightly worse, it's still good enough.  Even if you do have to muck with kernel modules it's not that hard now with DKMS. Even if the IO is blocking by default epoll has been around for decades and works fine.So at that point, if the kernel is good enough, and if we can get userland decent enough, then desktop Linux is better than Windows. Linux is good enough, without ads, with recovery tools that actually work, and performs comparably or better than Windows.",

I buy nearly every native Linux game I can find that is reasonably priced and sounds remotely interesting.

I only have anecdotal evidence, but I have my dad who is very non-tech savvy who after about a day with gnome actually said it's the first desktop environment that he liked more than Windows 95. There has been one time in 5 years that he had to reach out for technical assistance. It turned out that he had been misled by a prompt to buy Ubuntu pro and had gotten into a weird state. I blame that one solely on canonical, not on Linux in general. After that I switched him to Fedora, and he's been running that now for a few years and didn't even realize I had changed his underlying OS. He is able to install anything he wants from the graphical storefront, and same with updates. In the early days we did have some trouble getting his printer to work, though once we switched him to Fedora everything on that printer worked out of the box. When my sister came over to his house with her MacBook, she had to mess with the Mac to get the printer working for over an hour, and it was still pretty hit or miss. It would lose half the jobs she tried to send to it. It truly is remarkable how usable Linux is for the average person now. For people that have to run software that only runs on Windows or Linux, excluding games of course since steam and other game managers handle those wonderfully now, there is definitely still a bit of pain. But for people who can get by with cloud-based or Linux friendly software, it's really quite good.",

For someone well versed in the technicalities, yes. For a layman, probably not.Now, that said, it was the only problem I had in 4 years. It has been very smooth sailing besides that.My experience with Windows prior to that was always horrible. Yearly clean installs because after a while the computer felt extremely sluggish.

Change for change's sake, needless shifting in settings/config menus.  Weird \"we tried to make this similar to mobile\" themes in some places but not others.  Overly complex os navigation, without clear goals or direction.Frankly - the OS apple is producing for their traditional computers feels like garbage.  I use Arch/Gnome on my personal hardware and I feel like some time in the last 5ish years my opinion swapped - I used to think Gnome was mostly copying Apple design choices, but slightly worse.  Now I think Gnome is just a more clear, more usable DE than what Apple is releasing.  I moved my wife to Arch/Gnome on her personal laptop last year, and the sure sign was that she hasn't really had any problems with it.All that said... I still keep a laptop around with Windows 11 on it, because I have a couple of legacy tools (CNCs, solar inverters) that still want it, and holy shit is modern Windows just absolute trash.  I grew up on Windows, from windows 3.1 to windows 10, and it's the worst of the 3 by a good distance right now.You know something's gone wrong with commercial tech companies when the only OS that actually feels like it's intentionally designed for users is the free product.",

          "content": "Something I learned on HN years ago was the principle that often something that is riding to the top of the hyper curve is usually not a good product, but a good feature in another product.At CES this year, one of the things that was noted was that \"AI\" was not being pushed so much as the product, but \"things with AI\" or \"things powered by AI\".This change in messaging seems to be aligning with other macro movements around AI in the public zeitgeist (as AI continues to later phases of the hyper curve) that the companies' who've gone all-in on AI are struggling to adapt to.The end-state is to be seen, but it's clear that the present technology around AI has utility, but doesn't seem to have enough utility to lift off the hype curve on an continuously upward slope.Dell is figuring this out, Microsoft is seeing it in their own metrics, Apple and AWS has more or less dipped toes in the pool...I'd wager that we'll see some wild things in the next few years as these big bets unravel into more prosaic approaches that are more realistically aligned with the utility AI is actually providing.",

LLM models _do not_ fit into 4MB of SRAM :).And LLM inference is heavily memory bandwidth bound (reading input tokens isn't though - so it _could_ be useful for this in theory, but usually on device prompts are very short).So if you are memory bandwidth bound anyway and the NPU doesn't provide any speedup on that front, it's going to be no faster. But has loads of other gotchas so no real \"SDK\" format for them.Note the idea isn't bad per se, it has real efficiencies when you do start getting compute bound (eg doing multiple parallel batches of inference at once), this is basically what TPUs do (but with far higher memory bandwidth).",

And in fact highlights what's wrong with AI product development nowadays.AI as a tool is wildly popular. Almost everyone in the world uses ChatGPT or knows someone who does. Here's the thing about tools - you use them in a predictable way and they give you a predictable result. I ask a question, I get an answer. The thing doesn't randomly interject when I'm doing other things and I asked it nothing. I swing a hammer, it drives a nail. The hammer doesn't decide that the thing it's swinging at is vaguely thumb-shaped and self-destruct.Too many product managers nowadays want AI to not just be a tool, they want it to be magic. But magic is distracting, and unpredictable, and frequently gets things wrong because it doesn't understand the human's intent. That's why people mostly find AI integrations confusing and aggravating, despite the popularity of AI-as-a-tool.",

It does this if the comment is a 2 page essay or \"asdfasdf\". Ideally the alert would only happen if the comment seemed important but it would readily discard short or nonsensical input. That is really difficult to do in traditional software but is something an LLM could do with low effort. The end result is I only have to deal with that annoying popup when I really am glad it is there.The funny thing is that this exact example could also be used by AI skeptics.  It's forcing an LLM into a product with questionable utility, causing it to cost more to develop, be more resource intensive to run, and behave in a manner that isn't consistent or reliable.  Meanwhile, if there was an incentive to tweak that alert based off likelihood of its usefulness, there could have always just been a check on the length of the text.

There are alternatives. Heck, I'm not a fan of Apple either but at this point I'd recommend a MacBook for anyone wanting to get away from Windows and not comfortable with Linux or a Chromebook.",

The only exceptions tends to be mobile and game developers. Collectively cloud+web, mobile, and games account for like 98% of all new devs it seems. Nobody learns anything else.The web is going to become the desktop UI in the future for this reason alone. It's going to be slower and much more bloated than almost any other alternative, but it's got the critical mass of adoption behind it and that's what determines core technologies in the industry. Technical merit is a distant second or third.This is frustrating but it's not surprising to one who has studied biology and evolution. In evolution this is called \"path dependence,\" and it's why we have weird things like a man's testicles hanging in a bag below his body. A previous evolutionary path optimized the sperm production process to run at a lower temperature than the rest of the body, so then evolution's hack for this is to put them in a bag outside the body. Ticket closed with \"resolved.\" The pathways taken through a complex solution space determine the outcome and the outcome is often bizarre and \"hacky\" for this reason. The key is that it's very hard to back-track. Once a path has been taken, it's very hard to un-take it.Large industries and markets are essentially \"biological,\" not rationally designed, so you get the same kinds of phenomena.It could be much worse. If Linux+HTML+JS had not taken over, we might have the Microsoft Enterprise Web(tm) where Visual Basic (not VB.NET, OG Visual Basic) is the main language and each service or site would require an NT license for every node and an IIS license for every web hostname. UIs might be written in ActiveX or desktop ones in Microsoft C/C++ with OLE and similar horrors. It might be just as slow and infinitely uglier and more expensive and less open. Apple would be dead and open source would much more marginalized than it is today. The net would basically be a total MS monopoly. If you didn't live through the 90s: this nearly happened.",

I believe that's what happened here.- Once a proof is formalized into Lean (assuming you have formalized the statement correctly), there is no doubt that the proof is correct. This is the core of our approach: you can do a lot of (AI-driven) search, and once you find the answer you are certain it's correct no matter how complex the solution is.Happy to answer any questions!",

Issues with possible solutions, errors, and unresolved history.AI did not \\\\\"solve\\\\\" any issues on its own, but what stood out to me was the speed at which concepts could be rewritten, restructured and tested for stress.A mental model that has been useful to me is that AI is not particularly good at providing the first answer, however, it is very good at providing the second, third, and tenth versions of the answer, especially when the first answer has already been identified as weak by a human.In these instances, the progress seemed to stem from the AI being able to: Quickly reword and restate a given argument. Convert implicit assumptions into explicit ones. Identify small gaps in logic before they became large.What I have been grappling with is how to differentiate when AI is just clarifying versus when it is silently hallucinating structure. Is the output of AI being treated as a draft, a reviewer, a rubber duck, or some combination? When is the output so fast that the rigor of thought is compromised? I am interested in how others are using AI for hard thinking and not just for writing cleanup.",

Of course, that will require a lot of human expertise too: even this one was only \"solved more or less autonomously by AI (after some feedback from an initial attempt)\".People are still going to be moving the goalposts on this and claiming it's not all that impressive or that the solution must have been in the training data or something, but at this point that's kind of dubiously close to arguing that Terence Tao doesn't know what he's talking about, which to say the least is a rather perilous position.At this point, I think I'm making a belated New Years resolution to stop arguing with people who are still staying that LLMs are stochastic parrots that just remix their training data and can never come up with anything novel. I think that discussion is now dead. There are lots of fascinating issues to work out with how we can best apply LLMs to interesting problems (or get them to write good code), but to even start solving those issues you have to at least accept that they are at least somewhat capable of doing novel things.In 2023 I would have bet hard against us getting to this point (\"there's no way chatbots can actually reason their way through novel math!\"), but here we are are three years later.

We have proofs that are gigabytes (I believe even terabytes in some cases) in size, but we know they are correct because they check in Lean.This particular pattern of using state of the art work in two different areas (LLMs and theorem proving) absolutely has the potentially to fundamentally change how mathematics is done. There's a great picture on pp 381 of Type Theory and Formal Proof where you can easily see how LLMs can be placed in two of the most tricky parts of that diagram to solve.Because the work is formally verified we can throw out entire classes of LLM problems (like hallucinations).Personally I think strongly typed language, with powerful type systems are also the long term ideal coding with LLMs (but I'm less optimistic about devs following this path).",

          "content": "Tao has a comment relevant to that question:\"I doubt that anything resembling genuine \"artificial general intelligence\" is within reach of current #AI tools.  However, I think a weaker, but still quite valuable, type of \"artificial general cleverness\" is becoming a reality in various ways.By \"general cleverness\", I mean the ability to solve broad classes of complex problems via somewhat ad hoc means.  These means may be stochastic or the result of brute force computation; they may be ungrounded or fallible; and they may be either uninterpretable, or traceable back to similar tricks found in an AI's training data.  So they would not qualify as the result of any true \"intelligence\".  And yet, they can have a non-trivial success rate at achieving an increasingly wide spectrum of tasks, particularly when coupled with stringent verification procedures to filter out incorrect or unpromising approaches, at scales beyond what individual humans could achieve.This results in the somewhat unintuitive combination of a technology that can be very useful and impressive, while simultaneously being fundamentally unsatisfying and disappointing - somewhat akin to how one's awe at an amazingly clever magic trick can dissipate (or transform to technical respect) once one learns how the trick was performed.But perhaps this can be resolved by the realization that while cleverness and intelligence are somewhat correlated traits for humans, they are much more decoupled for AI tools (which are often optimized for cleverness), and viewing the current generation of such tools primarily as a stochastic generator of sometimes clever - and often useful - thoughts and outputs may be a more productive perspective when trying to use them to solve difficult problems.\"This comment was made on Dec. 15, so I'm not entirely confident he still holds it?https://mathstodon.xyz/@tao/115722360006034040",

Turns out: Since NodeJS and Python were installed, it found a good idea to print the respective versions. I could not care less about those versions. The other part was that it thought that I would like to see my AWS region. Well, I mean, I have built something with AWS a few years back, and the config file for that still exists, but no, I don't want to see that region every time I open a shell. Finally, the default is to have the prompt in a new line. I think when you have a long prompt that makes sense, and it might also be a taste thing. However, the documentation has this example at the beginning about newlines:  # Inserts a blank line between shell prompts\n  add_newline = true\n\nSo I thought `add_newline = false` should do the trick, but it didn't.Luckily, the AI (GPT-5.2) was pretty good at explaining and giving instructions for changing things.

We saw it happen in 1989 with the astonishing fall of the USSR. Conversely, those systems which best take into account the complex, frail, brilliance of human nature and build in flexibility, checks and balances, and tolerance tend to survive beyond all hopes.Markdown is an 'improvement' over HTML, makes it even more flexible and tolerant and easier to write without using tags.",

The Markdown syntax for tables might look pretty when you read it, but the only time I've ever bothered to produce it has been with the help of a WYSIWYG Markdown editor (e.g. Typora). And I actively recoil from the idea of modifying one (since that could potentially change the width of a column, requiring carefully adding/removing spaces from the other cells in the column... ugh.)Meanwhile, I've been hand-rolling + hand-modifying HTML tables with ease since the HTML4 days. HTML tables do not emit ugh-fields. (With the tradeoff that they do not visually read as tables in their source-code representation. But they still do read as cells grouped into records — and for most cases, that's almost as good.)And yeah, sure, for embedding wholly-plaintext data tables, you could just drop some lines of CSV in a quote-fenced code block. But that doesn't work if you want that table to render with MD semantics itself, such that you can style the contents of the cells using MD syntax. Think \"links to additional resources in Github READMEs.\"IMHO, a format that's mostly just Markdown, but which deprecates MD's existing table syntax in favor of a much-simpler-to-write \"sigil-annotated list-of-lists\" syntax, would be a big hit.(And, now that I think about it, would also probably make it simple for LLMs to spit actual headered tables at you, rather than relying on endless hierarchical bulleted lists.)",

Additionally CSS was supposed to let users choose how all this was displayed.All of this failed - or rather, was undone and cancelled by the \"modernization\" of the Web. Namely the arrival of for-profit companies on the Web, be it Facebook of the press like the New York Times.It was a boon as they brought valuable content, but they brought it with their own rules. The first set of which is the ads-supported model, which is by definition the opposite of free content; an ad-supported website is not free in a very sneaky way, and it's not just about privacy and manipulative practices (targeted ads, as if ads were not already manipulative enough). Users are actively prevented from consuming the content the way the want.The situation today is that very few browsers offer out-of-the-box a way to apply a personal CSS, and I think none will generate a ToC from the headers of a HTML page.And the \"semantic\" part - far from specialized and more accurate semantic markup frameworks that were considered - is being completely taken over by LLMs; an insanely expensive brute-force solution IMHO.The web has already be reinvented mostly the way you suggest, see for instance the Gopher and Gemini protocols, but they'll stay forever \"niche\" networks.

You have firefox (gecko) and fifty flavors of chromium. Webkit on Linux has essentially been relegated to embedded devices or the GNOME epiphany browser, which I'll admit while is a noble effort, lags a bit in the stability and power-user features department. Big reason for that is that it lacks the commercial backing to keep up with the modern web standards rat race.Kagi bringing orion to Linux changes the calculus. It introduces a third commercially incentivized, consumer-grade engine to the platform. Even if you never use orion, you want this to succeed because it forces WebKitGTK upstream to get better, which benefits the entire open source ecosystem.The sticking point like always will be media playback (read: DRM/widevine). That is the graveyard where Linux browsers go to die. If Kagi can legally and technically solve the widevine integration on a non-standard Linux webkit build, they win. If not, it will be a secondary browser.",

We've had them on macOS in various forms over the years (with OmniWeb being the original), but for a long time the only browsers built to integrate well with Linux desktops were minimal and light on features (like the WebKit version of GNOME Web/Epiphany).It probably matters less to Linux users who do the minimal tiling WM thing, but as someone more drawn to traditional floating DEs it's always bothered me how alien the browsers one might actually want to use feel running in a GTK or Qt DE. Themes can help reduce the gap, but it never disappears — that last 10-20% always remains as an unavoidable side effect of how the big browsers are built, with it being particularly pronounced with Firefox and derivatives.Of course a GTK based browser like Orion isn't going to feel the best under a Qt desktop like KDE, but GTK themed to match Plasma is a good deal closer than the bespoke UI found in e.g. Firefox or Chrome.",

Honestly, the arguments made by the founder (I believe he's the founder anyway. I may be wrong) in the related feedback thread kind of soured me a little bit on Kagi. The arguments were essentially:1. It's a lot of work to maintain an open source project accepting community contributions. Absolutely true, but that's not what's being asked for. Providing a tarball under an open source license doesn't add any significant work.\n2. No one has asked for the Kagi backends to be open sourced, so why is the browser different? Obviously because I run the browser on my machine. Your backend runs on your machine.\n3. We need to protect our IP. Then release it under a copyleft license. Or if you absolutely must, release your proprietary bit under a non-open source license.\n4. You don't need the source because we send 0 telemetry, which you can verify using a network proxy. That's hardly the only thing to be worried about with a binary blob. Even if you kept the code completely closed source, by just releasing a tarball with the source under a proprietary license, I can build my own binary from source and eliminate this threat.",

It being built the way it is was a boon back when extensions were capable of radically changing the browser's UI, but now it simply puts a (unfortunately low) hard cap on how excellent its UI can be.Funny enough, Epiphany used to be a more power user oriented browser, and it used to be powered by none other than Gecko. Unfortunately, Mozilla killed embedding in Gecko and that (along with related projects like Camino and K-Meleon) came to a screeching halt and Gecko became hard coupled with Mozilla's UI decisions.",

The issue is also the distinction between widevine L1, i.e hardware-backed DRM and L3 (the software backed one).Correct me if I'm wrong but to stream 4K, studios require a hardware root of trust and a verified media path. They need a guarantee that the video frames are decrypted inside a trusted execution environment  and sent directly to the display without the OS kernel or user space being able to read the raw buffer.AFAIK Windows and macOS provide this pipeline at the OS level. OTOH, ChromeOS gets 1080p/4K not because it has massive market share but cause the hardware and boot chain are locked down by the almighty Google.On desktop Linux, where you have root access and can modify the kernel or compositor to inspect memory, there is technically no way to guarantee that secure path to the studios' satisfaction. Am I right in this assumption?Unless the DRM providers change their threat model, which sounds unlikely to me. Or distros start shipping signed and locked-down kernel modules that prevent the user from being root, which is again unacceptable to most (me included), we will likely be capped at 720p for some time now.",

Orion isn't open source yet primarily because we're a 5-person team that spent 6+ years building this and created significant IP doing so, and we're not in a position to defend our work against a well-funded company using it as a base (we care very much about the business model of the browser surviving). Restrictive licenses help in theory but enforcing them against a company with a larger legal budget doesn't.We also see limited upside from community contributions - the number of people who can meaningfully work on a WebKit browser is small (from our experience hiring), and most of them already work at Apple or Kagi. Meanwhile, managing an open source codebase of this size would add real strain to our small team.The plan is however to open source when Orion is self-sufficient (business model of Orion is you are the customer and can pay for it - like we used to pay for browsers 20 years ago before advertisers started paying for our browsing), meaning it can sustain its own development independent of Kagi Search. I want to take the opportunity to thank all people who supported the Orion browser vision  [1]. We're not there yet but recent 1.0 launch and expanding to Linux are steps in that direction. And on Jan 1st this year we began development of Orion for Windows (HN exclusive yay!).I understand this is unsatisfying to people who want source access now.

The rest (like accepting patches or supporting external developers) is customary but by no means obligatory. You don’t have a capacity for it - don’t do it, easy. There are thousands of developers who do that - they just dump whatever they have under a nice license and that’s it.Unless you’re saying your legal department doesn’t have capacity to handle licensing concerns, especially if you’re using or potentially using non-FLOSS third party components. That I can totally understand, it could be pretty gnarly.Please don’t be mistaken: Free Software is a purely legal matter of what you allow  users to do with your work - not some operating principles or way of organizing processes.Note: All this said, I can understand that you may not want to grant some freedoms to the end users, particularly the freedom to redistribute copies, because this could affect your plans of selling the licenses.

As we go through the daily grind of life, we forget how privileged we are to be alive.I found the following two paragraphs truly incredible.> All of us begin in the same place. Whether sinner or saint, we are not owed our life. Our existence is an unnecessary extravagance, a wild gesture, an unearned gift. Not just at birth. The eternal surprise is being funneled to us daily, hourly, minute by minute, every second. As you read these words, you are rinsed with the gift of time. Yet, we are terrible recipients. We are no good at being helpless, humble, or indebted. Being needy is not celebrated on day-time TV shows, or in self-help books. We make lousy kindees.> I’ve slowly changed my mind about spiritual faith. I once thought it was chiefly about believing in an unseen reality; that it had a lot in common with hope. But after many years of examining the lives of the people whose spiritual character I most respect, I’ve come to see that their faith rests on gratitude, rather than hope. The beings I admire exude a sense of knowing they are indebted, of resting upon a state thankfulness. They recognize they are at the receiving end of an ongoing lucky ticket called being alive. When the truly faithful worry, it’s not about doubt (which they have); it’s about how they might not maximize the tremendous gift given them. How they might be ungrateful by squandering their ride. The faithful I admire are not certain about much except this: that this state of being embodied, inflated with life, brimming with possibilities, is so over-the-top unlikely, so extravagant, so unconditional, so far out beyond physical entropy, that is it indistinguishable from love. And most amazing of all, like my hitchhiking rides, this love gift is an extravagant gesture you can count on. This is the meta-miracle: that the miracle of gifts is so dependable. No matter how bad the weather, soiled the past, broken the heart, hellish the war – all that is behind the universe is conspiring to help you – if you will let it.",

Nikki had great holidays, mostly because her adult daughter was here for a week. Nadine (\"Shh.\") has decided she's going to retire at the end of the month but hasn't yet told anyone at the store.Raffy, the UPS delivery guy I see maybe five times a year?

They like it here, but think job opportunities will be better back home.I'm sure many here are familiar with \"This is Water,\" the commencement speech given by David Foster Wallace. Many often cite his line, \"Everybody worships,\" his observation that we all hold aspects of life in reverence, whether religious things or otherwise. It's a valid, pithy point, but I always thought the key part to his speech comes later and has been widely overlooked:And the so-called real world will not discourage you from operating on your default settings, because the so-called real world of men and money and power hums merrily along in a pool of fear and anger and frustration and craving and worship of self. Our own present culture has harnessed these forces in ways that have yielded extraordinary wealth and comfort and personal freedom. The freedom all to be lords of our tiny skull-sized kingdoms, alone at the centre of all creation. This kind of freedom has much to recommend it. But of course there are all different kinds of freedom, and the kind that is most precious you will not hear much talk about much in the great outside world of wanting and achieving.... The really important kind of freedom involves attention and awareness and discipline, and being able truly to care about other people and to sacrifice for them over and over in myriad petty, unsexy ways every day.He delivered that speech in 2005. Before the modern smartphone. All those people I mentioned earlier were strangers. That's no longer the case because all of us chose to interrupt what we were doing and open up a little to someone unfamiliar. It's a choice.

          "content": "I see others expressing this point, but I'll add my two cents: this essay really bothered me.1. The writer describes hitchhiking to work every day, presumably for months or years. He doesn't describe in any way how he paid back that kindness, either to the people he rode with directly, or just by paying it forward.2. The writer describes traveling in Asia for 8 years, and many of the instances of kindness he describe imply very strongly that he intentionally put himself at risk, where others were faced with the choice to help him or let him suffer consequences. It's one thing to get caught in a rip current and need assistance; it's another entirely to swim out past where you are safe, and then wait for someone to rescue you -- and to do that repeatedly for eight years. Further, it is obvious from the language used that he was traveling rough by choice, with the privilege and economic security of his background, and yet repeatedly accepting -- I would argue demanding -- the help of people from a poorer background than himself. He was cosplaying poverty and repeatedly being assisted by people living it for real.3. The backyard idea seems similarly pushy. He says he was never turned away, not once. So he believes that no one, given an actual free choice, would rather not have a stranger camp in their backyard. He ignores the possibility that people would feel uncomfortable about rejecting someone presenting as having no place to stay, and rather believes that everyone he asked woke up that day thinking about how happy they'd be to do a favor for a stranger. And he couches the whole process as him doing them a favor.4. He lists multiple instances where people less well-off than him went to great lengths to help him, without ever thinking about why they might feel obligated, and through it all admitting that not only doesn't he engage in such kindness himself, he can't imagine that he would.5. And through it all he characterizes what he very nearly describes as him pushing himself on people as \"willingness to be helped\" -- as some sort of saintliness.And of course each of these people only saw him once, for a short while. Reading this essay we see how it is a pattern: how he is essentially a traveling con man, moving from mark to mark, letting each of them believe that he just happens to need help this one time, so they put good out into the universe. But in reality he is taking, taking, taking, abusing the world's willingness to help -- if everyone did what he did, the world would swiftly become a meaner, poorer place.",

One incident I always remember is how the front wheels of my car went into a ditch and got completely stuck while trying to pull out of a shopfront parking lot. I was fairly new to driving and was at a complete loss as to what to do next. Within seconds, a crowd of men gathered, some from the bus stop nearby, others from the restaurant in front of the parking spot. \"Get back in and reverse when we tell you\", said one person. Then a group of about 5 men literally lifted the front of my car and placed the wheels back on terra firma. I reversed out of the ditch, parked the car and got out to thank them, but they had dispersed as rapidly as they had assembled. I always thought my people a bit brusque in social interactions -- we don't greet shopkeepers or supermarket cashiers; we don't smile randomly at each other; we don't often say thank you.

Many religions try to square these: Buddhisms central focus is to \"stop grasping\" your desires, Christianity wants you to \"surrender\" and put your faith in god. And then you also have articles like this that have a vague spiritual bent but mostly preach mindfulness and gratitude as a balm to our general dissatisfaction. Do we still need constant anxiety around our safety, do we still need to feel dissatisfied with each achievement and constantly want more? Or were those just useful imperatives for an animal 50,000 years ago but useless to us today?In my personal life I have momentary success being mindful/grateful, but the bare reality is we are the product of millions of years of life being a short cruel struggle, fraught with danger. Does modern society give us the right to throw all that away and pretend we get to float around observing the beauty of the world? Or is our life supposed to be a battle?",

He immediately remembered me, invited me to his home, and talked to me, again, for an hour or so, about AI, optimism, and how to change the world.To be frank, I never emailed him thank you, and I still feel guilty about that, but now I feel like it was never needed or asked for.

The discomfort so many people in this thread feel with receiving kindness and the devaluing of the gift of companionship, gratitude, and a good story is a testament to how far off human norms our society is these days.I struggle with this a lot myself - I've had to overcome deep feelings of inadequacy and insecurity because I never valued what I offered people just by being present and because I always felt like I had to \"square the books\" - that every interaction or relationship was an exchange that needed to square its ledgers. The best thing for my mental health has been to become comfortable just being with people and accepting their continued presence and return to my company as something that doesn't require an exchange - that human companionship and kindness are things we enjoy as people, not services to be itemized and accounted for.One interesting note on this is that it's not just an \"old world\" phenomenon - if you look at many old farmhouses across the midwest, they've got a separate covered section that's accessible from outside the house - the assumption was that travelers passing by could and would spend the night there, and often the owners would have supplies of oatcakes or other durable foodstuffs for travelers, because everyone who traveled needed somewhere to stay or something to eat at some point, and reciprocity could be assumed when the homeowner traveled themselves in the future.",

When I suggested that might not be a good idea, his reply was something like \"no, you don't understand, the universe will give me everything I need\". I understood why a lot of old hippies end up as forest hermits or sticking to a small group: the burn-outs, mooches, and grifters wear out their welcome very quickly.That said, I think there's something about going out into a world on a wandering 'quest' that appeals to human nature on a deep level. I'd hesitate to call the author a con man, since you wouldn't call a mendicant or pilgrim a con man. If his motivation was just to squat in people's backyards and mooch free meals until he gets kicked out and then wander around until he finds a new host, I'd agree. But if people want to help him on his personal project of experiencing the kindness of he world, I wouldn't call that taking advantage of people who offer their help freely.The difference between a spiritual pilgrim and a vagabond freeloader depends on how much of a romantic one is, and if you admire Don Quixote or not.",

Because he never describes paying it forward, in fact quite the opposite.And again, he repeated describes never failing to get the help he seeks. Either he is taking advantage of people, or he is the luckiest person on the planet.Interestingly, I have some similar incidents in my past: I took the Amtrak to Crescent City, then bicycled south along the coast of California. On the train up I met someone from Eureka, who invited me to stay at their place when I got there the second night, and I did. It's been so long I had forgotten the situation until just now, and I don't remember the conversation leading up to that. I don't think I was pushing for a place to stay; I stayed at a hostel in Crescent City the night before, and another somewhere near Leggett the night after, and I never slept indoors for free on the rest of the trip.Later, when I was looking for a public trash can in a small town, I asked someone if there were any. They said no, and just to toss whatever I wanted to get rid of into the back of their pickup, and they'd drop it at the dump the next time they went.My knees got extremely painful by the time I reached San Francisco. At a hostel near Muir Beach(?) I ran into a guy from San Diego (where I lived) who took half my gear (lightening the load) and gave me a Mueller knee brace he happened to have with him to wear for the rest of the trip. That act definitely saved my trip.Still later on the trip, camping at a park I ran into a guy who was also bicycling, homeless by choice -- he said he was divorced and living without an address to deny his ex her alimony. He said to never go into a grocery store without checking the dumpster out back first, and handed me an over-date yogurt :-)But I can very confidently state that I wasn't asking for any favors. Maybe that makes me not \"open\" to the world looking to help me?At first I questioned whether I was being judgmental. But writing it out as I did convinced me I was not. If people are helping him at every turn, even people far less well off than he is, that is clearly him pressing the world's \"kindness\" button -- hard.\"We ended up sleeping like sardines under a single home-woven blanket while snow fell.\" -- how would he have kept warm if they didn't share the blanket with him? Did they have any option but to share their blanket or feel like they were leaving an innocent to freeze?Actually, I have an experience for that as well. When I was prepping for the California ride I rode through the Cuyamaca mountains east of San Diego. I brought no clothing but a bike jersey and shorts. It dropped well below freezing that night. I spent the entire night huddled in a bad K-Mart sleeping bag, dozing, shivering, and cursing how long it was until dawn. I suppose I could have knocked on any van or RV at the site, but I didn't even think to, even though I was legitimately freezing. Again, maybe I'm not \"open\" enough, but I made a stupid decision to not bring better gear, or at least a jacket -- I earned that consequence, and I paid for it in full. :-)And I tell that story all the time. At this point I don't think it's a better or worse story/memory than the one I would have if I had asked someone for help and received it.I've received help many times in my life. But again, it rubs me the wrong way if someone purposefully and repeatedly throws themself into deep water, expecting others to rescue them. And to me at least, it seems clear that's what he's done.",

Ex: Plan mode is basically bootstrapping how that TODO list gets seeded and how todos ground themselves when they get reached, and user interactions are how you realign the todo lists. The todolist is subtle but was a big shift in coding tools, and many seem to be surprised when we discuss it -- most seem to focus on whether to use plan mode or not, but todo lists will still be active. I ran a fun experiment last month on how well claude code solves CTFs, and disabling the TodoList tool and planning is 1-2 grade jumps: https://media.ccc.de/v/39c3-breaking-bots-cheating-at-blue-t... .Fwiw, I found it funny how the article stuffs \"smarter context management\" into a breeze-y TODO bullet point at the end for going production-grade. I've been noticing a lot of NIH/DIY types believing they can do a good job of this and then, when forced to have results/evals that don't suck in production, losing the rest of the year on that step.

The differentiator is the harness, CLI, IDE extension, sandbox policies, filesystem ops (grep/sed/find). But what separates effective agents from the rest is context engineering.

If you are receiving inputs via webhooks (like from a Slack bot), then what do you do? It's not rocket science but it's also not trivial to do right. What about hooks (guardrails) and approvals? Should you halt execution mid-loop and wait or implement it as an async Task feature like Claude Code and the MCP spec? If you do it async then how do you wake the agent back up?

I built a persistent Python REPL subprocess as an MCP tool for CC, it worked so insanely well that I decided to go all the way. I already had an agentic framework built around tool calling (agentlib), so I adapted it for this new paradigm and code agent was born.The agent \"boots up\" inside the REPL. Here's the beginning of the system prompt:  >>> help(assistant)\n\n  You are an interactive coding assistant operating within a Python REPL.\n  Your responses ARE Python code—no markdown blocks, no prose preamble.\n  The code you write is executed directly.\n\n  >>> how_this_works()\n\n  1. You write Python code as your response\n  2. The code executes in a persistent REPL environment\n  3. Output is shown back to you IN YOUR NEXT TURN\n  4. Call `respond(text)` ...\n\nYou get the idea. No need for custom file editing tools--Python has all that built in and Claude knows it perfectly. No JSON marshaling or schema overhead. Tools are just Python functions injected into the REPL, zero context bloat.I also built a browser control plugin that puts Claude directly into the heart of a live browser session. It can inject element pickers so I can click around and show it what I'm talking about. It can render prototype code before committing to disk, killing the annoying build-fix loop. I can even SSH in from my phone and use TTS instead of typing, surprisingly great for frontend design work. Knocked out a website for my father-in-law's law firm (gresksingleton.com) in a few hours that would've taken 10X that a couple years ago, and it was super fun.The big win: complexity. CC has been a disaster on my bookkeeping system, there's a threshold past which Claude loses the forest for the trees and makes the same mistakes over and over.

That was (as far as I know) the first of these articles making the point that the core of a coding agent is actually quite simple (and all the deep complexity is in the LLM). Reading it was a light-bulb moment for me.FWIW, I agree with other commenters here that you do need quite a bit of additional scaffolding (like TODOs and much more) to make modern agents work well. And Claude Code itself is a fairly complex piece of software with a lot of settings, hooks, plugins, UI features, etc. Although I would add that once you have a minimal coding agent loop in place, you can get it to bootstrap its own code and add those things! That is a fun and slightly weird thing to try.(By the way, the \"January 2025\" date on this article is clearly a typo for 2026, as Claude Code didn't exist a year ago and it includes use of the claude-sonnet-4-20250514 model from May.)Edit: and if you're interested in diving deeper into what Claude Code itself is doing under the hood, a good tool to understand it is \"claude-trace\" (https://github.com/badlogic/lemmy/tree/main/apps/claude-trac...). You can use it to see the whole dance with tool calls and the LLM: every call out to the LLM and the LLM's responses, the LLM's tool call invocations and the responses from the agent to the LLM when tools run, etc. When Claude Skills came out I used this to confirm my guess about how they worked (they're a tool call with all the short skill descriptions stuffed into the tool description base prompt). Reading the base prompt is also interesting. (Among other things, they explicitly tell it not to use emoji, which tracks as when I wrote my own agent it was indeed very emoji-prone.)",

Having said that, it's not clear how much that really matters at all for making the Claude Code CLI specifically better-performing than other coding agents using the same LLM (the tool calls are fairly generic and the LLMs are good at plenty of tool calls they weren't RLVRed on too).The other advantage Anthropic have is just that they can sell CC subscriptions at lower cost because they own the models. But that's a separate set of questions that don't really relate to technical capabilities.Anyhow, to follow up on your point, I do find it surprising that Claude Code is still (it seems?) definitively leading the pack in terms of coding agents. I've tried Gemini CLI and Codex and they feel distinctly less good, but I'm surprised we haven't seen too many alternatives from small startups or open source projects rise to the top as well.

The models are trained around immutable conversation ledgers with user/tool/assistant blocks, but there are compelling reasons to manipulate both sides at runtime and add synthetic exchanges. Priming with a synthetic failure and recovery is often more effective than a larger, more explicit system message. Same with memory, we just haven't figured out what works best.For code agents specifically, I found myself wanting old style completion models without the structured turn training--doesn't exist for frontier models. Talking to Claude about its understanding of the input token stream was fascinating; it compared it to my visual cortex and said it'd be unreasonable to ask me to comment on raw optic nerve data.\"Tell it to reread it again\"-exactly the problem. My bookkeeping/decision engine has so much documentation I'm running out of context, and every bit is necessary due to interconnected dependencies. Telling it to reread content already in the window feels wrong, that's when I refine the docs or adjust the framework. I've also found myself adding way more docstrings and inline docs than I'd ever write for myself. I prefer minimal, self-documenting code, so it's a learning process.There's definitely an art to prompts, and it varies wildly by model, completely different edge cases across the leading ones.

      "abstract": "该讨论围绕“AI是否构成商业模式的压力测试”展开。有用户认为AI如同地震，本身不摧毁企业，而是暴露其商业模式的脆弱性，例如Tailwind Labs因AI能快速生成定制化代码而面临困境。讨论中提到，部分人将AI比作电灯泡取代蜡烛，认为这是技术进步带来的必然变革，而非单纯的“压力测试”。也有用户指出，AI正在将可明确指定的工作商品化，但无法替代需要持续运维和实际执行的任务，如保障系统稳定与安全。分歧在于如何看待AI的影响：有人认为它迫使企业重新思考价值所在，即从“指定需求”转向“实际交付”；也有用户质疑将商业模式挑战归咎于AI是否合理，强调企业本就需随环境变化而调整。共识是AI正深刻改变软件行业的价值分配，但对其具体定位仍存在不同解读。",

Given that most of the \"open source product with premium hosting\" models are just reselling hyperscaler compute at a huge markup, the customers are going to realize pretty quickly that they can use an LLM to setup some basic devops and get the same uptime. Most of these companies are offering a middleman service that becomes a bad deal the moment the customer has access to expertise they previously lacked.I also think he's glossing over the fact that one of the reasons why companies choose to pay for \"ops\" to run their software for them is because it's built by amateurs or amateurs-playing-professional and runs like shit. I happen to know this first hand from years of working at a company selling hosting and ops for the exact same CMS that Dries' business hosts (Drupal, a PHP-based CMS) and the absolute garbage that some people are able to put together in frameworks like Wordpress and Drupal is truly astounding. I'm not even talking about the janky local businesses where their nephew who was handy with computers made them a Wordpress site - big multinational companies have sites in these frameworks that can barely handle 1x their normal traffic and more or less explode at 1.5x.The business of hosting these customers' poorly optimized garbage remains a big business. But we're entering into an era where the people who produce poorly optimized software have a different path to take rather than throwing it to a SaaS platform that can through sheer force of will make their lead-weight airplane fly. They can spend orders of magnitude less money to pay an LLM to make the software actually just not run like shit in the first place. Throwing scaling at the problem of 99.95% is a blunt instrument that only works if the person paying doesn't have the time, money, or knowledge to do it themselves.Companies like these (including the one I work for currently) are absolutely going to get squeezed from both directions. The ceiling is coming down as more realize they can do their own devops, and the floor is rising as customer code quality gets better.

LLMs get a lot of value from that work, but they also break the loop that used to send value back to the people and companies who created it.The Tailwind CSS situation is a good example. They built something genuinely useful, adoption exploded, and in the past that would have meant more traffic, more visibility, and more revenue. Now the usage still explodes, but the traffic disappears because people get answers directly from LLMs. The value is clearly there, but the money never reaches the source. That is less a moral problem and more an economic one.Ideas like GPL-style licensing point at the right tension, but they are hard to apply after the fact. These models were built during a massive spending phase, financed by huge amounts of capital and debt, and they are not even profitable yet. Figuring out royalties on top of that, while the infrastructure is already in place and rolling out at scale, is extremely hard.That is why this feels like a much bigger governance problem.

I actually think CSS (and SQL or other “perfectly functional” interfaces) hold some kind of special power when it comes to AI.I still feel that the main revolution of AI/LLMs will be in authoring text for such “perfectly functional”-text bases interfaces.For example, building a “powerful and rich” query experience for any product I worked on was always an exercise in frustration. You know all the data is there, and you know SQL is infinitely capable. But you have to figure out the right UI and the right functions for that UI to call to run the right SQL query to get the right data back to the user.Asking the user to write the SQL query is a non-starter. You either build some “UI” for it based on what you think is the main usecases, or go all in and invent a new “query language“ that you think (or hope) makes sense to your user. Now you can ask your user to blurb whatever they feel like, and hope your LLM can look at that and your db schema, and come up with the “right” SQL query for it.",

(Not that you could do 'negative' testing well in AOP, but even positive testing is annoyingly difficult with CSS.)EDIT: Just to add.

I worked with a certified trainer/rehab professional for many years and built a program to keep me as pain-free as possible. I rebuilt the entire thing with ChatGPT/Gemini about 6 weeks ago, and I've had less pain than at any other point in my life. I spent at least 12 hours working with AI to test and research every exercise, and I've got some knowledge to help guide me, but I was amazed by how far it has come in 12 months. I ran the results by a trainer to double-check it was well thought out.)",

          "content_cn": "ChatGPT显著提升了我理解健康问题、解读检测报告以及与医生有效沟通的能力。昨晚我和妻子还在讨论它在2025年给我们带来的巨大帮助。希望它能持续保持这样的水准。我期待监管机构能持续关注并制定明智的法规。我不希望它消失，因为它对我的生活具有不可估量的价值。（举个例子：我因背部损伤进行康复治疗已近十年，曾与持证训练师/康复专家长期合作制定了一套疼痛管理方案。六周前我借助ChatGPT/Gemini重构了整个方案，现在疼痛感已降至人生最低水平。我花费至少12小时与AI测试研究每个训练动作，虽然具备一定专业知识进行引导，但它在12个月内的进步速度令我惊叹。最终我还请训练师核验了方案以确保其严谨性。）"

In fact, ChatGPT could also help operate the clinical trials which is a highly paperwork intensive business, and therefore something that AI could add value to.Ultimately pharmaceutical companies pay up to $100,000 per participant to hospital networks these charges must be itemized as expenses from the hospital on the most part (bounties are illegal usually.) open AI would provide a cheap way in for pharmaceutical companies to identify participants given that OpenAI has an incredible perspective into the physical and psychological state of their users. Imagine how much more is shared with OpenAI compared to a clinical trial coordinator at a hospital when a psychiatric drug is being tested.This would also give OpenAI leverage in partnering with pharmaceutical companies. OpenAI executives have stated this is a goal, but otherwise they’ve made little progress on it.It’s wild to imagine - someone with borderline personality disorder having delusional conversations with an AI chat Bot for six months, receiving an offer to participate in a clinical trial, and then having their subsequent AI conversations used as evidence to analyze the efficacy of the drug. The ironic thing is if that person had delusions about hidden forces listening to them…they’d be RIGHT!",

Not making the same mistake again.I know it's the panel, because I have an office BenQ 21 inch with technology called sth like EyeCare on the side as the second monitor. Compared to the gaming one - it's a balm on my eyes. Sometimes I'd put a document or LLM window there even when the main screen is empty, just because of how nice it feels on the eyes.Except for few situations where the poor man's HDR does help me see more details in the dark (small edge in multiplayer), I believe that I would be better off with a monitor engineered for office work.Think about it, I got lured by all the gaming hype, but what I really needed is a monitor that is 80% office and 20% gaming, not 100% gaming. And I believe that's the case with others complaining about the eye strain.Moisturizing eye drops and Safeeyes (eye exercising Linux app) help a lot though. Safeeyes has an alternative on Mac called EyeLeo (but never used that). Recommend them both to everyone in this thread. Take care of your eyes. They are the most suspectable to drying part of our body - eye exercises help for that. And they are fed with only a miniscule artery, eye exercises help keep a good throughput on that too.",

          "content": "During the pandemic, we had a natural experiment at my previous company. Our org had started an org wise auto ‘meeting starts 5 minute past’ while others had the traditional meetings start on the hour.Also conveniently, we also had the calendar data for internal meetings, internal VC software (not zoom) db that logs the participants when they join and leave meetings and employee function db.I was serendipitously the lead DS for analyzing the effectiveness of the ‘starting 5 minutes past’. After joining and cleaning a lot of the data, the data showed:1) at the start of the trial, meetings ended on time. Then after few weeks it slip to ending late, negating the usefulness. Other orgs did not see meetings running late.\n2) ICs tend to stick around and over run meetings, while managers tend to leave meetings on time.\n3) if I remember right, we had a survey data that showed pretty clearly that managers prefer the ‘starting 5 minutes past’ while ICs do not care or have negative sentiment.The biggest predictor for people who prefer starting late is how crowded their schedules are. Managers tend to have very crowded schedules which means they want a break between meetings, while ICs prefer not having to waste time waiting.In the end we reverted back to normal schedule. It was just easier for busy people to bounce early.",

          "content": "In my experience, the recipe for having meetings interface smoothly with the time that surrounds them is twofold:1. Constrain the meeting duration to a slighly smaller blocks than natural time.2. Be diligent and efficient in managing time within the meeting.That means, for 60 minutes of natural time, 50 minutes of meetings.You start on time, you end on time.The first few minutes are for pleasantries (important!) and getting everyone focused on the topic and goals of the meeting. This gives people the possibility of running slightly late without missing anything too important, but they still come into an ongoing meeting and are noticeably late.But: you quickly move on to the meat of the meeting, even if people are still missing, and keep things moving while having an eye on time. (Sometimes, you can even start without key people there and at least get everyone else synced and thinking about the topic.)Once you get close to the end (that is, 40 out of 50 minutes of runtime for an \"hour\"-long meeting, but depending on subject and people), you make sure to come to a conclusion and wrap things up by the 50 minute mark. If it's clear that's not enough time, you move to wrapping things up enough and discuss how you will keep the discussion going after the meeting time runs out. In any case, you have some time for parting pleasantries, while the meeing is officially over on time and people are free to leave.This leaves a bit of slack, while people expect to start and end on time, and it crucially gives everybody enough time to move between meetings with some breaks, even those unfortunate folks whose jobs consist of lots of back-to-back meetings.Starting on the (half) hour and ending after 50 (25) minutes works well, in my experience, and syncs well with the calendars of external meeting participants.I know this works, because I have been in meetings like this, and I have run meetings like this. Of course, this will not work in 100% of all meetings, but it can go a long way in making a lot of them much better.",

Most calendar applications cannot clearly display 5 minutes past, and the meeting appears to start on the hour visually. One of the attendees ends up dialling in at the hour, and then everyone gets a notification that the meeting has started.Half of the people who get the notification click \"join\" without checking. This ends up with a half-populated meeting room. The issue becomes obvious, and somebody says, \"Let's dial back in 5 mins\", and drops off. Half of the people like the idea and drop off, while the rest decide to stay and chat.Meanwhile, some of those who dropped off see this as a great opportunity to grab a brew. That inadvertently triggers some water-cooler, kettle-corner chats, and they end up running late for the 5-past. The rest usually get engaged in something else to make use of 5 minutes, and miss 5-past since no new notifications are issued due to the people already chatting in the meeting :)",

It’s best to do this while it’s fresh and between people that can “talk shop” at a granular level (whatever that means for your org/team). It’s actually a good thing your ICs want to collaborate or align separate from management. If you’re a manager and you could technically continue on the meeting, consider opting out to give them space as peers.

It starts exactly on time. Every item has a designated number of minutes.

When that bell rung, you could finish the thought, but the meeting would break at the 25 minute mark.  If you didn’t accomplish the agenda, another meeting could be set, but it needed to be at least 2 hours after the one that just broke.  Even meetings without him had to follow the rule.  He also had a request that were were supposed to follow if we could, which was to allow ourselves to only schedule one meeting in an hour.Obviously it was pretty chaotic at first and I recall us being pretty brutal in our assessment of his “crazy meeting quirk”.  However after a few weeks something pretty interesting happened:- Brevity and productive discussion became common.  People usually went with their best opinion- we usually finished the agenda (probably because we set reasonable agendas for 22 mis) and rarely needed that rollover meeting- we spent more time at our desks actually doing instead of just talking about doing.  I recall that team being really productive overall.Later when I moved into leadership roles I attempted to bring this methodology but my own leadership generally was not supportive enough to allow me to be as rigid and I didn’t see the same success with the method…but to this day 32+ years later I still think it had merit.I had asked him where he had learned it.  My recollection is that he formulated it after reading that the average person’s attention span in a meeting was 27 minutes and he figured no one was productive after that, so he decided it was pointless to go longer.",

The right amount of meetings is probably always going to be more than ICs want, and less than managers want.

We didn’t have the power to change the whole org, but we could control team meetings to create space before other meetings. Since the whole team was on board with this, there was always someone who would call out that it was time for the meeting to end, to prevent them running long.At the same time, we had a rule that meetings would start when they say they start. This was after being incredibly frustrated by a guy on another team who would schedule his meetings to start on the hour, but then display a message that said we’d start at 5 after, to give people time to join, assuming other meetings would run long. This felt like he was wasting everyone’s time who showed up on time, and had the net effect of everyone showing up late to his meetings. If people learned they should show up late to his meetings, they can learn to show up on time to our meetings. Then we can stop waiting around hoping that everyone shows up. When someone shows up late to a meeting that’s already well underway, that sends a strong signal that they should be on time for the next one.",

Most users probably, like me, spend a lot of time (hours every day) in various org-mode documents, staring at what is essentially the raw mark-up. Org-mode in Emacs makes only a few minor changes to how the text is displayed, like hiding link targets, so you rarely look at the output. I export less than 1% of my org documents, so usually I don't care at all about what formatting renders like, as long as I get the mark-up correct enough that org-mode itself is functional (links can be followed, sections collapsed etc). The few documents I do want to export I can imagine using workarounds like the zero-width spaces, but it is not like there is often a need to have things looking like org-mode mark-up in the output.For me at least, worrying about escaping mark-up would be too distracting and just add noise, as the raw mark-up is what I will read anyway.

This has been a killer feature for me, because there are many places where I want /specific/ HTML, and neither org-export nor pandoc will compile org plaintext the way I want (not unless I invest inordinate amounts of time futzing with templating systems). So I just hand-code HTML using those export blocks, and I'm /fine/.There are also a couple of places where I use org-babel to call a shell script that updates an exported HTML block in-line. I use this trick to tweak a common HTML fragment (like email form) in one place and expand it into custom HTML, wherever I need to.Ditto LaTeX, although I confess, I'm not a heavy user, so I almost certainly haven't faced the troubles you have.

Like showing a vertical line graph rather than discrete bars, with the lows inbetween days.

But after reading this article I can't help but be bugged off that the information density in the main page is significantly worse here than in Dark Sky.\nDark Sky showed hourly forecast with a 2h resolution. This is a negligible difference in precision IMHO (weather predictions are inherently imprecise anyway - and a more precise graph could be - is - one tap away), but it allows to show a time range that is twice as wide! On my screen, breezy weather is able to show me the forecast for the next 5h until I scroll - this is OK, but it's annoying. The hours are very spaced apart, and there is a 1h resolution. With tighter spacing and 2h resolution, 12 or 16 hours could be displayed at once - which is far more likely to cover the time I am going to spend outside, which as the article states, is the main reason why I might want to check an hourly forecast anyway.All the other android apps mentioned here have the same issue.I might try to open an issue in their GH, or even a PR... A toggle for \"denser graphs\" and a setting for hourly resolution could do wonders.",

I haven't moved either.And just anecdotally, Dark Sky was a delight to use. Apple Maps makes it a chore to extract the same utility from their app.",

That alone scared microsoft so much that it backed offAfter the backing off is when Companies like google, heck Apple was directly invested to be saved by microsoft just so that they dont get threatened by the govt as monopoly and amazon.In a way people mention so why couldn't Microsoft create their own engine but its also the fact that blink/chromium is based on fork of webkit which itself is a fork of KHTML from the kde team but webkit added many features (from what I could tell) and is a really complex software in it of itselfThis was created by apple and apple as we know it would not have been able to exist without Microsoft backing off themMy point here is that in previous times, Microsoft was a large curtain blocking any innovation if they wanted but after it was feared by even a threat like monopoly, they took it very seriously and thus we have the cultural innovation in many ways that we haveNow the monopoly question was a genuine question still launched by the government.Today the landscape is different, Google and these large tech companies would buy things and the meta strategy has become to sell, its a very cynical point of things which really just ends up screwing the customers in the end.The government doesn't care, it might slap some 1% fine and there is a quote that if crime's punishment becomes only fines, then crime becomes legal and the fines compared to company are so small and they got legal structure so high that they strech it for as much as possibleOverall, the govt.'s being really lobbied by these tech giants and they stiffle tech innovation in the endIn the end all of them are the same, they all kind of want to be a microsoft pre monopoly era.Govt's lack of understanding of the matters around the world is the reason why tech feels so intrusive. This has real consequences to you and me, now I don't trust the govt will be able to improve if its gets lobbied or corrupted and that's a seperate matter and might take new laws all around the world to prevent such corruption / lobbying but right now, the other best thing is to showcase support by being the minor fraction of the population who supports/donates to open source / msme businesses",

          "content": "Mobile is a massive chicken-and-egg problem. The main purpose of a smartphone these days is to run apps. Nobody is going to buy a smartphone which can't run the apps they need in their day-to-day life. On the other hand, no company is going to write apps for a platform with basically zero users.OpenMoko & friends are selling devices which basically only run Firefox, and sometimes make calls as well. The only people interested in that are diehard FLOSS enthusiasts, which means they have to use ancient hardware because new stuff doesn't have open drivers, which means that even if you ignore the app ecosystem they compare incredibly poorly to mainstream smartphones. No wonder they keep failing.Interestingly, the desktop/laptop market is heading the other way. The move to cloud SaaS products means a decent number of people now only need a browser. What's keeping a lot of people on Windows is often literally one or two applications. Valve's push for Proton is the perfect example of this: the Steam Deck is providing a huge incentive to fix those last few bugs keeping a game from running on Linux, and with the way Microsoft is screwing up W11 it is now ironically the gamers who are moving to Linux.What you are seeing in \"regular computer stores\" is mostly irrelevant. That market is basically dead. Corporate gets its machines directly from Dell/HP/Lenovo, PC enthusiasts mostly get custom builds, and casual people stick with smartphones and tablets. In-store PC sales is now reduced to a university student's Google Docs machine - and Microsoft is doing a pretty good job bribing the manufacturers to push Windows there.",

Modern colonisation began after the arrival of Hans Egede in 1721, acting with the support of what was then Denmark-Norway. During the second world war, when Denmark was occupied by Germany, Greenland was occupied by the US and was returned to Denmark in 1945.It became part of the kingdom of Denmark in 1953, and in 1979 home rule was introduced. But Denmark still controls Greenland’s foreign and security policy. It has its own parliament, Inatsisartut, and two MPs in the Danish parliament, Folketing. But calls for independence have been growing.Tensions have escalated significantly between Greenland and Denmark in recent years. There is intense anger in Greenland over investigations into the forced contraceptive (IUD) scandal of the 1960s and 70s, prompting the former Greenlandic prime minister to accuse Denmark of genocide. There have also been protests in Copenhagen and Nuuk over the separation of Greenlandic children from their parents.\nDenmark has banned the use of highly controversial “parenting competency” tests on Greenlandic people that have resulted in Greenlandic mothers being separated from their children. In September, after years of failing to acknowledge the violations, Denmark officially apologised to the victims of the IUD scandal, in which thousands of Greenlandic women and girls were forcibly fitted with contraceptive coils without their knowledge or consent. And in December, victims won a legal fight with the Danish government to receive compensation.In recent years there has been growing support for Greenlandic independence. But amid the spectre of Trump’s threat, Greenland in March formed a new four-party coalition government in a show of national unity, with the first page of the coalition agreement stating: “Greenland belongs to us.” The pro-independence party, Naleraq, which is the most US- and Trump-friendly party, came second in the election and is now in opposition.\nAccording to a 2009 agreement with Denmark, Greenland must hold a successful referendum before declaring independence.[1] https://www.theguardian.com/world/2026/jan/06/why-is-donald-...",

Winner takes all. You may have been voted by 50% + 1 (even less) citizens but the other half is totally not represented like in a parliament.2. No parliament/party that you need to have backing of. In a parliamentary democracy the prime minister won't just lose opposition's votes, but has to govern in a way that its own party won't boot you.3. Single person can claim popular mandate. Often in opposition to the parliament/senate whatever. So you end up in situations like the disaster in Poland where government and president are from different parties and the government gets vetoed everything.4. Extremely hard to remove. A prime minister is a vote of no confidence away from losing its seat. The president can ask them to resign in extreme situations. A president? Removing them is beyond difficult.Honestly this is such an obvious disaster to have people vote for a president rather than a parliamentary prime minister.The last parliamentary democracy to turn authoritarian has been Sri Lanka 50+ years ago. It's very hard to get so bad so fast in parliamentary republics.Honestly I can't comprehend Americans thinking their constitution is some holy grail. It's old and has been written centuries ago without all the experience we have in modern democracies. Eastern Europe too has made very bad choices with similar setups and democratically elected presidents.Say what you want but Germany or Italy have built in way more resilience to these absurdities by having the parliament elect the president which forces them to elect mostly neutral unbiased figures that will support and oversee whoever ends up being in government.",

It also probably goes with the fact that it is a very big country sharing one culture, and it is easy to not spend too much time looking at what other countries are doing.> presidential democracies where presidents are elected by popular vote are a disasterI would like to add France to the examples supporting your case: in the first round, Macron got less than 20% of the votes, and a non-negligible part of those was already trying to be \"efficient\". As in, the people would have voted for someone else, but they voted for Macron because it seemed more likely that he could win against Le Pen, the far-right candidate.This means that less than 20% of the people (those who voted of course) wanted Macron. On his first day, more than 80% didn't want him. Still he behaves like if the French people wanted him.> by having the parliament elect the presidentAn example I like is Switzerland: they don't have a president at all. They elect their parliament, and the parliament elects the Federal Council made of 7 people from the main parties.What this means is that the executive power is a consensus by construction, and most of the people is represented (because the Federal Council is made of the major parties, which represent the majority of the people and go from left to right).Feeling represented is very important: when the people does not feel represented, they take out to the street and protest.

It would be nice if user input immediately cut out the example piece",

Also they don't even show up properly in the sheet.As the melodies get longer and longer with each win, this devolves quickly into a memory game. I'd like to keep playing ear training, but I struggle with remembering what sequence of notes came at steps 8+.This is somewhat aggravated by completely resetting the current level and replaying the whole melody after a single mistake. If I keep making a mistake in note 10, I get all the notes over and over again, which is a bit maddening.",

So if you push middle C, it might look like this:NOTE_ON 60 (middle C) 98 (velocity),\nNOTE_OFF 60Some keyboards never send NOTE_OFF events, instead they send NOTE_ON with velocity 0. On these keyboards, pressing middle C looks like this:NOTE_ON 60 98,\nNOTE_ON 60 0Both are valid MIDI streams, and all stream processors should react appropriately to both. This app likely does not correctly map zero velocity NOTE_ON events to NOTE_OFF with the same pitch.",

Here's a fun little factoid: Lexipol is a company which sells various pre-written policies to police departments, including an ALPR policy; Lexipol is also a parent company of Police1, which helps police departments find public grant money to purchase Flock subscriptions, and Flock in turn is heavily featured on Police1.So, if you're a police department, you go to Police1 (Lexipol) for news and product info, they pitch you on Flock, you fill out a form, you sign a contract, and then later you need an actual ALPR policy for your department, and Lexipol sells you that, too. The policy of course is extremely friendly towards vendors like Flock.Flock exerts a lot of influence with the police departments that subscribe to their platform. We've repeatedly had to respond to the same talking points from PDs (and some city officials) that are very clearly getting all of their info from Flock, and in some cases coached by them.And YCombinator startup Flock Safety is extremely misleading in many of their product, service, and business statements.",

Maps tend to have to be widely shared within government and engineering, and if you know what you're looking for, it's remarkably straightforward to find ways to access layers you would normally have to pay for.  It's a consequence of the need to share data widely for a variety of purposes -- everything from zoning debates within a local county to maps for broadband funding across an entire country create a public need to share mapping information.  Keys don't get revoked once projects end as that would result in all the previously published links becoming stale, which makes life harder for everyone doing research and planning new projects.Moreover, university students in programs like architecture are given access to many map layers as part of the school's agreements with the organizations publishing the data.  Without that access, students wouldn't be able to pick up the skills needed to do the work they will eventually be hired for.  And if students can get data, then it's pretty much public.Privacy is becoming (or already is) nearly impossible in the 21st century.",

The analog (film) part protects against deepfakes and serves as proof if you need it (for the source and final product alike).There various solutions out there after the leaks that keep happening where documents and confidential information is served/staged in a way that will reveal the person with who it is shared.

Off-the-shelf printers are of course a big no-no.If all else fails, that analog picture technique works best for exfil, but the final thing you share will still track back to you.

Experienced, capable and qualified. Or at least an earnest attempt at thinking about something and explaining the discoveries in the ways that thinking was done before ChatGPT. For some reason I find myself using phrases involving the hands (etc. hands-on, handmade, hand-spun) as a metaphor for work done without the use of LLMs.I emphasize insight because I feel like the series of work on the Snowden documents by libroot is wanting in that. I expressed as much the last time their writing hit the front page: <https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46236672>.These are summaries. I don't think that it yields information that can't  otherwise be pointed out and made mention of by others; presumably known and reputable. With as high-profile of an event that this is I'd expect someone covering it almost 16 years later to tell us beyond what when judged on the merit of its import amounts to a motivated section of the ‘Snowden disclosures’ Wikipedia entry.The discussion that this series invites typically is centered around people's thoughts about the story of the Snowden documents in general, and in this case exchanges about technical aspects like how PDF documents work and can be manipulated in general. The one comment that I feel addresses the actual tension embedded in the article—\"Who edited the documents?\"—leads to accusations that the documents were tampered with by the media: <https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46566372>. I don't think that that's an implausible claim but I find issue with it being made with such confidence by the anonymous source behind the investigations (I'm withholding ironically putting \"investigations\" in...nevermind).If the author actually provided something that advanced to the reader why this information is significant, what to do with or think about it and how they came about discovering the answers to the aforementioned 'why' and ‘what’ and additionally why they’re word ought to matter to us at all, I'd be less inclined to speculate that this is just someone vibe sleuthing their way through documents that on the surface are only significant to the public as the claim \"the government is spying on you\" is.This particular post uncovers some nice information. It's a great find. I'm in no position to investigate whether it was already known. But what are we supposed to learn from it aside from \"one of the documents were changed before it was made public\". What's significant about the redaction? Is Ryan Gallagher responsible? Or does he know who is. Is he at all obliged to explain this to a presumably anonymous inquirer?

They're good socially but for education in the age of AI I can't imagine university even being worth it anymore outside of the absolutely most prestigious ones there are.Certainly not your run-of-the-mill UC school except maybe UCLA or Berkeley and only then for very specific majors.I went to a UC and graduated 14 years ago. I basically had to teach myself everything with the other students once I got into my major. And this school has done notable research in my field. But the quality of education was just terrible. Nobody could teach us multi-threading, compilers, theory of computation, networking, or algorithms properly. Like not at all. The students had to help each other the best they can and the most experienced or smartest individuals were just the ones that actually were able to do those subjects competently. But everyone else was pretty much shorted on their education, just like the poor math education throughout the country. It's pretty irritating how much it costs versus the quality you get. No way is it worth it.And since I've graduated I learned that none of these topics is IQ-limited at all whatsoever. Math is completely intuitively if taught properly. ANYONE can learn it to a high level with good analogies and demonstrations and applicative knowledge. I developed competence with linear algebra and vector math not in school but doing game programming after I graduated. That's what actually made it \"make sense\".I tutored several students since I graduated and I think I helped them for $30 an hour learning fundamentals and how to program and I think I did a significantly better job one-on-one for these students at a way cheaper rate than they would have to pay in school. It's sad.I imagine LLMs could do a better job for many things than research professors that just throw slides on the board and barely elaborate on anything.

Firstly, the recharging will only work with AC lines, and there's currently a lot of hype around UHVDC lines which are not compatible. Secondly, the AC lines must carry substantial current (ideally thousands of amps) for the recharging to not take forever. You can of course carry a much larger transformer on the drone to compensate, but this will in turn severely limit your flight time (ours was 1kg on a drone of 4.5kg and we could charge with 50W from 300A line current). You also have to account for significant daily fluctuations in the line current. It'll be interesting to see how the tech evolves, and I'll definitely be following these startups closely.",

It's pretty fucked up that bycatch at this rate is just accepted because it surely is going to lead the species to extinction. Humans are pretty fucking arrogant.If these sharks were not caught at this rate then I would agree that they shouldn't be studied in ways that require killing them, but since they are, I think it is better to at least get some knowledge out of it and possibly raise awareness of the problem.Edit: read the article, and it actually says it was caught by the scientists and not as bycatch.

It wasn't an ideal setup, but I didn't care. In fact, I thought it was a cool hack to play games at the time without forking out a lot of money to build a gaming PC.Maybe there are probably better options now to game than attaching a dedicated GPU with whatever hardware you already have, but I can verify that external GPUs are really cool and useful (though a 5090 is definitely not needed).

The problem here is that drawing can become an option or a requirement based on information that this representation doesn't capture.First the simpler version of this problem. After 50 full moves without a capture or pawn move, a draw MAY be claimed. After 75 moves, a draw MUST be claimed. This requires a count to be kept that may require up to 7 more bits.The bigger problem is draw by repetition. If a position repeats exactly (same castling and en passant options) for a third time, then a draw MAY be claimed. If it repeats exactly for a fifth time, then a draw MUST be claimed. (Usually it is claimed on the third time, but you don't have to.) Applying this rule correctly requires not just knowing the current position, but what positions have occurred previously, and how often. Back to the last pawn move, capture, or change in potential castling status. This may require (per the first rule) knowing what up to 75 different past positions were.The best way to store this history is almost certainly not as a list of positions, but as a history of moves. But, even if done efficiently, we will need more bytes for that history than we needed for the position.",

The worst case is that we need 32 of these pairs, which requires 24 bytes. That brings us to a worst case of 28.How can we eliminate two bytes?We can more cleverly encode the mask so that two bytes are used to express the all-pieces-present, and certain other cases. A fully decoded mask is only used for boards that have too few pieces to break over 26 bytes.For instance suppose we have a two-bit header encoding several cases:00 - no piece are missing (32 six-bit coordinates follow)01 - one piece is missing, followed by 5 bit ID of that piece10 - two pieces are missing, followed by two 5 bit IDs of the two pieces11 - three or more pieces missing, full mask follows.In case 11, we need a 32 bit mask, followed by as many as 29 coordinate pairs.So 2 + 32 + 6 * 29 = 208 bits.And hey look, by dumb luck, 208 / 8 = 26.I will check the article later.",

In both cases, you get the full position, plus who to move, plus full information on future castling and en-passant possibilities. This is the FEN state of the board, minus the two counts. It's more than the information you get from a published chess diagram in a book or magazine. Although in a book or magazine inevitably \"who to move\" is represented somehow, castling and en-passant possibilities are not usually.Method 1: Lichess method; 64 bit header, 1 bit per square indicating occupied squares, then (up to) 32 4 bit codes for the 32 occupied squares. So 24 bytes worst case!Method 2: My own method a list of 2 bit codes, one of the 4 codes indicates empty square, the other three codes are prefixes for a second 2 bit code. Three prefixes applied to one of 4 code values gives a total of 12 possibilities corresponding to any possible chess piece. Worst case 32x2 bits plus 32x4 bits = 24 bytes.In each case there is sufficient entropy to create tricks to add the supplementary information (who to move etc.), similar tricks are in the original article.I mention my own method from my Tarrasch Chess GUI https://github.com/billforsternz/tarrasch-chess-gui only for completeness. If I had known about method 1 I would have used that, it is simpler and better and there is much more entropy available making the tricks easier.I would urge commentators to keep clear the difference between compressing a chess position (this challenge), a chess move and a chess game. A chess move needs far less bits of course. A complete chess game is always encoded as a list of moves, not positions, for this reason.Edit: I should have mentioned that the chief advantage of method 1 over method 2 is average bits required. An empty board is 64x1 bits = 8 bytes for method 1 and 64x2 bits = 16 bytes for method 2.Edit 2: I am going to describe my tricks, just because they are fun. Two kings the same colour means Black to move. Two White kings means the first king is white, two black kings means the first king is black. Otherwise White to move. A friendly pawn on the first rank means an enpassant vulnerable pawn. Swap it with the 4th rank square to get the actual contents of both squares. A hostile pawn on the first rank is an unmoved rook or king, establishing all castling rights. The castling and en-passant tricks can be combined in a pleasant and harmonious way.",

For \"chess board\", we don't consider any castling, en-passant or similar. We might store a bit for \"who goes next\". This is useful for chess puzzles where state shenanigans are rare (I think).But if we store castling state, I think we are already trying to store the whole game state, and this is representable only by full history because of move repeating rules.So, I think storing board state as a sequence of moves is more interesting. I would estimate that a number of possible actions on average is closer to 8 than to 16, so it would give as 3 bits for half-move and 6 bits for full move. 24-move game could be represented with 18 bytes, which is considerably lower than 26 bytes!You can get close to average bit per move, if you reuse \"spare\" places for the next move. So, for instance, first move have 20 possibilities, which is representable by 5 bits, but you can reuse \"spare\" 32-20=12 possibilities as a bit for the next move.This is a representation assuming you use only \"move validator\" thing that returns a list of possible moves.

I did find myself wondering where the tipping point is between using a slightly less efficient storage method vs. computational overhead.For example, you technically don't need to track castling availability. If you're storing the entire match as a set of positions, you can deduct that by replaying the previous positions. A quick search seems to indicate that an average chess match runs for about 40 moves, so replaying all previous positions isn't that bad, on average.If you need to store millions of chess matches, being able to store them in ~1kb each might be more important, compared the overhead of unpacking each state. If you need to query for certain positions across all those matches, maybe less \"compression\" is desired.I always enjoy articles about how people store data and how they think of capturing states, but I also like to know the context and how that data is use or queried.",

That’s surprising to me because I’ve only heard of the well-ordering theorem by Zermelo, which is a fundamental theorem in set theory, stating that any set has a well-ordering assuming the axiom of choice. It’s amazing and mind-bending in its own right (imagine a well-ordering for reals), but is clearly not very relevant to computer science.I find the well-ordering principle slightly bewildering. It seems to presuppose the existence of an ordering on natural numbers and then prove this principle. But I’ve never been taught things this way; you always construct the natural numbers from Peano and define the ordering first, then you can actually prove the well-ordering principle rather than leaving it as an axiom.",

Almost everything is in the format:    eval(unescape(escape`<<97 wide characters>>`.replace(/u../g,'')))\n\nCan't they just have the same agreement that Ford Prefect had with Mr Prosser? \"So, assuming I'm going to use this lossless compression technique to fit 194 characters into a 140 character tweet... how about you just show the 194 characters and say that I fitted into 140 characters?\"I suppose you could make the same argument about size-based competitions at demo parties; the limit is strictly 4096 bytes but everyone + their dog is using Crinkler to compress a 12-20KB executable down to that size. In fact, part of the effort is in aligning data and tweaking constants with Crinkler's algorithm in mind, to make the raw data more amenable to compression! But at least then, it's not a constant compression (turning any 194 ASCII characters into 97 Unicode characters which with embedded decoder makes exactly 140 characters)",

The solution of https://beta.dwitter.net/  mitigates the lack of accessibility of the encoding, while keeping the fixed target at the same time introducing a new practical target.The Math.sin css color encoder were concessions to practicality, there has been much discussion as to whether a Dwitter 2 should simply include additional characters required to the same preconfig and let people do it themselves, and let them use the characters for something else if they can think of something.I'd like something like this just to see how creative people get in doing that.

      "abstract": "该讨论围绕Ghostty终端应用的内存泄漏修复展开。核心话题是开发者通过深入分析定位并解决了因滚动缓冲区管理不当导致的内存泄漏问题，相关技术细节在博客文章中有详细说明。\n\n社区普遍赞赏开发团队的快速响应和详尽的技术分析，许多用户表示从中学到了有价值的调试方法。有人认为这类底层内存管理问题凸显了系统编程的复杂性，也有用户指出此类问题若使用Rust等内存安全语言可能更容易避免。讨论中提到部分用户对修复方案的实施时间有不同看法，有人期待立即发布补丁，而开发者计划将其纳入后续功能更新。此外，有用户对终端应用是否需要自定义内存分配器表示疑虑，同时也有技术性探讨涉及滚动缓冲区是否可采用环形缓冲区等替代设计。整体而言，社区肯定开发者的专业态度，但也在技术选型和问题预防方面存在不同观点。",

It was a problem noted by users in a thread here just last week, https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46460319While Claude Code might have been the reason this bug became triggered by more people, there are some of us who were hitting it without ever having used Claude Code at all.  Maybe the assumption about what makes a page non-standard, isn't as black-and-white as presumed.  And I wonder if the leak would have been triggered more often for people who use scrollback-limit = 0, or something very small.Probably not a huge deal, but it does seem the fix will needlessly delete and recreate non-standard pages in the case where the new page needs to be non-standard, and the oldest one (that needs to be pruned) already is non-standard and could be reused.",

If you think I'm wrong enough to down vote, please reply why.I don't understand why that is the preferred fix. I would have solved it other ways:1. When resizing the page, leave some flag of how it was allocated. This tagging is commonly done as the always 0 bits in size or address fields to save space.2. Since the pool is a known size of contiguous memory, check if the memory to be freed is within that range3. Make the size immutable. If you want to realloc, go for it, and have the memory manager handle that boundary for you.Both of those not only maintain functionality which seems to have been lost with the feature reduction but also are more future proof to any other changes in size.",

This is because our initBuf below would change the underlying\n// memory length which would break our memory free outside the pool.\n// It is easiest in this case to prune the node. \n```https://github.com/ghostty-org/ghostty/commit/17da13840dc71b...#3, it seems, would require making a broader change. The size effectively is immutable now (assuming I'm understanding your comment correctly): non-standard pages never change size, they get discarded without trying to change their size.#2 is interesting, but I think it won't work because the implementation of MemoryPool doesn't seem like it would make it easy to test ownership:https://github.com/ghostty-org/ghostty/blob/17da13840dc71ba3...You'd have to make some changes to be able to check the arena buffers, and that check would be far slower than the simple comparison.",

There was a desync in information where the underlying assumption is that size tells you where the data came from and that the size of the metadata and the size of the allocation move in tandem across that boundary.#1 and #2 are fixes for breaking that implicit trust. #1 still trusts the metadata, #2 is what I'd consider the most robust solution is that not only is it ideally trivial (just compare if a pointer is within a range, assuming zig can do that) but it doesn't rely on metadata being correct. #3 prevents the desync.I really don't understand the code base enough to say definitively that my ways work, which is I guess what I'm really looking for feedback on. Looking at the memorypool, I think you're right that my assumption of it being a simple contiguous array was incorrect.ETA: I think I'm actually very wrong for #2.

This means Rust cares that for any value V of type T, Rust can see that we did not destroy V twice (or more often).With Linear Types the compiler checks that you destroyed V exactly once, not less and not more.However, one reason I don't end up caring about Leak Safety of this sort is that in fact users do not care that you didn't \"leak\" data in this nerd sense. In this nerd sense what matters is only leaks where we lost all reference to the heap data. But from a user's perspective it's just as bad if we did have the reference but we forgot - or even decided explicitly not - to throw it away and get back the RAM.The obvious way to make this mistake \"by accident\" in Rust is to have two things which keep each other alive via reference counting and yet have been disconnected and forgotten by the rest of the system. A typical garbage collected language would notice that these are garbage and destroy them both, but Rust isn't a GC language of course. Calling Box::leak isn't likely to happen by accident (though you might mistakenly believe you will call it only once but actually use it much more often)I think the main part of Ghostty's design mentioned here that - as a Rust programmer - I think is probably a mistake is the choice to use a linked list. To me this looks exactly like it needs VecDeque, a circular buffer backed by a growable array type. Their \"clever\" typical case where you emit more text and so your oldest page is scrapped and re-used to form your newest page, works very nicely in VecDeque, and it seems like they never want the esoteric fast things a linked list can do, nor do they need multi-writer concurrency like the guts of an OS kernel, they want O(1) pop & push from opposite ends.

The whole library cost about £10.* Topics are organised into a tree structure using recursive Leiden partitioning and LLM labels. This gives a high-level sense of the themes.* There are several ways to browse. The most useful are embedding similarity, topic tree siblings, and topics cooccurring within a chunk window.* Everything is stored in SQLite and manipulated using a set of CLI tools.I wrote more about the process here: https://pieterma.es/syntopic-reading-claude/I’m curious if this way of reading resonates for anyone else - LLM-mediated or not.",

It takes hours to import 100 pdf files but I can take one folder that contains a mix of programming titles, self-help, math, science fiction etc. After the fully automated analysis you can clearly see the different topic clusters.I just spent time getting it all running on docker compose and moved my web ui from express js to flask.

The idea is that rather than zooming in on some tiny piece of text to examine very subtle or nuanced meanings, you zoom out to hundreds or thousands of texts, using computers to search them for insights that only emerge from large bodies of work as wholes. The book argued that there are likely some questions that it is only feasible to ask this way.An old friend of mine used techniques like this for dissertation in rhetoric, learning enough Python along the way to write the code needed for the analyses she wanted to do. I thought it was pretty cool!I imagine LLMs are probably positioned now to push distant reading forward in an number of ways: enabling new techniques, allowing old techniques to be used without writing code, and helping novices get started with writing some code. (A lot of the maintainability issues that come with LLM code generation happily don't apply to research projects like this.)Anyway, if you're interested in other computational techniques you can use to enrich this kind of reading, you might enjoy looking into \"distant reading\": https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Distant_reading",

I route requests for an upstream host (like stripe) through Envoy as a mitm proxy which injects the real creds after verifying the macaroon.It is such a powerful pattern. I'm always worried about leaking sensitive keys through prompt injection attacks (or just sending them to anthropic), but in this model you can attenuate the keys (both capabilities & validity window) client side. The Envoy proxy lives inside my flycast network so it can't be accessed externally.It would be so cool if fly built something like this into sprites.dev (though I can see how it would be spooky to have fly install their own certs for stripe, etc...)",

Our own company workspace has skills that have scoped access to fly, stripe, gmail, etc. We're definitely drinking the file-over-app personal-software-for-teams Kool-Aid, so the problem space for us includes access control and auditing.Love your work :)",
