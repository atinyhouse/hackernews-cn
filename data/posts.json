      "abstract": "该讨论围绕OpenAI新发布的Codex应用展开。核心话题聚焦于AI辅助编程工具的实际表现、技术实现方式及其市场定位。社区观点呈现明显分歧：部分用户对Codex的编程能力表示赞赏，认为其虽然存在错误但整体表现令人惊喜；也有用户严厉批评其反应迟钝、逻辑混乱且经常无视指令，甚至引发使用者的愤怒情绪。技术层面存在争议，有用户指出其基于Electron框架开发并质疑AI巨头为何不开发真正原生应用，但随即有反驳观点认为Electron完全能调用原生API，争论本质在于UI实现策略。产品策略方面，多位用户批评其仅支持Mac平台的做法显示出开发团队与主流市场的脱节。讨论中还提到该应用与Claude等竞品的相似性，以及其短期免费策略可能对编程代理市场产生的影响。整体而言，社区对AI编程工具的实际效用和技术路线尚未形成共识。",

          "content": "It is baffling how these AI companies, with billions of dollars, cannot build native applications, even with the help of AI. From a UI perspective, these are mostly just chat apps, which are not particularly difficult to code from scratch. Before the usual excuses come about how it is impossible to build a custom UI, consider software that is orders of magnitude more complex, such as raddbg, 10x, Superluminal, Blender, Godot, Unity, and UE5, or any video game with a UI. On top of that, programs like Claude Cowork or Codex should, by design, integrate as deeply with the OS as possible. This requires calling native APIs (e.g., Win32), which is not feasible from Electron.",

          "content": "I had been procrastinating putting in the effort to find a decent web designer to redesign our company’s website because I couldn’t stomach the hours I would need to put in to educate them about our messaging and to slowly go around and around iteratively to get the design nailed.Last week, I decided to try building the site myself using Codex (the terminal one). I chose Astro as the framework because I wanted to learn about it. I fed it some marketing framework materials (positioning statements and whatnot) and showed it some website designs that we like. I then asked it to produce a first cut and it one-shotted a pretty decent bit of output.AGI is definitely a few more years away, because I’ve since invested probably 30 hours of iteration to make the site into something that is closer to what I eventually want to launch. But here’s the thing: I never intended for Codex to produce THE final website. But now I’m thinking, “maybe we can?” On my team, we have just enough expertise and design know-how to at least know what looks good and we are developers so we definitely know what good code looks like. And Codex is nailing it on both those fronts.As I said, we’re far from AGI. There’s no way I can one-shot something like this. It requires iteration with humans who have years of “context” built up. But maybe the days of hiring a designer and just praying that they somehow get it right are behind us.",

          "content": "People's mileage may vary, but in my instance, this was so bad that I actually got angry while trying to use it.It's slow and stupid. It does not do proper research. It does not follow instructions. It randomly decides to stop being agentic, and instead just dumps the code for me to paste. It has the extremely annoying habit of just doing stuff without understanding what I meant, making a mess, then claiming everything is fine. The outdated training data is extremely annoying when working with Nuxt 4+. It is not creative at solving problems. It dosent show the thinking. The Undo code does not give proper feedback on the diff and if it actually did \"undo.\" And I hate the personality. It HAS to be better than it comes off for me because I am actually in a bad mood after having worked with it. I would rather YOLO code with Gemini 3 flash, since it's actually smarter in my assessment, and at least I can iterate faster, and it feels like it has better common sense.Just as an example, I found an old, terrible app I made years ago for our firm that handles room reservations. I told it to update from Bootstrap to Flowbite UI. Codex just took forever to make a mess, installed version 2.7 when 4.0.1 is the latest, even when I explicitly stated that it should use the absolute latest version. Then it tried to install it and failed, so it reverted to the outdated CDN.I gave the same task to Claude Code. Same prompt. It one-shotted it quickly. Then I asked it to swap out ALL the fetch logic to have SPA-like functionality with the new beta 4 version of HTMX, and it one-shot that too in the time Codex spent just trying to read a few files in the project.This reminds me of the feeling I had when I got the Nokia N800. It was so promising on paper, but the product was so bad and terrible to use that I knew Nokia was done for. If this was their take on what an acceptable smartphone could be, it proves that the whole foundation is doomed. If this is OpenAI's take on what an agentic coding assistant should be—something that can run by itself and iterate until it completes its task in an intelligent and creative way.... OpenAI is doomed.",

The browsers, on the other hand, use the same language, same rendering model, same layout system, and same accessibility layer everywhere, which is a massive abstraction win.You don't casually give up massive abstraction wins just to say \"it's native\".

Just create a command in .claude/commands that references an agent in .claude/agents. You can also just call parallel default Task agents to work concurrently.Using slash commands and agents has been a game changer for me for anything from creating and executing on plans to following proper CI/CD policies when I commit changes.To Codex more generally, I love it for surgical changes or whenever Claude chases its tail. It's also very, very good at finding Claude's blindspots on plans. Using AI tools adversarially is another big win in terms of getting things 90% right the first time. Once you get the right execution plan with the right code snippets, Claude is essentially a very fast typer. That's how I prefer to do AI-assisted development personally.That said, I agree with the comments on tokens. I can use Codex until the sun goes down on $20/month. I use the $200/month pro plan with Claude and have only maxxed out a couple times, but I do find the volume to quality to be better with Claude. So far it's worth the money.",

In order to have the same measurable outcome you'd need to perhaps use Codex in a plan state (there's experimental settings - not recommended) or other means (explicit detailed -reusable- prompt for planning a change). It's a missing feature if your preference is planning in CLI (I do not prefer this).You are correct in that this mode isn't \"out of the box\" as it is with Claude (but I don't use it in Claude either).My preference is to have smart models generate a plan with provided source. I wrote (with AI) a simple python tool that'll filter a codebase and let me select all files or just a subset. I then attach that as context and have a smart model with large context (usually Opus, GPT-5.2, and Gemini 3 Pro in parallel), give me their version of a plan. I then take the best parts of each plan, slap it into a single markdown and have Codex execute in a phased manner. I usually specify that the plan should be phased.I prefer out-of-CLI planning because frankly it doesn't matter how good Codex or Claude Code dive in, they always miss something unless they read every single file and config. And if they do that, they tip over. Doing it out of band with specialized tools, I can ensure they give me a high quality plan that aligns with the code and expectations, in a single shot (much faster).Then Claude/Codex/Gemini implement the phased plan - either all at once - or stepwise with me testing the app at each stage.But yeah, it's not a skill issue on your part if you're used to Plan -> Implement within Claude Code. The Experimental /collab feature does this but it's not supported and more experimental than even the experimental settings.",

The US corporations are forced by law to always prioritize whoever represents the current US government, and the current US government will remain hostile as long as it is in charge; but even afterwards it is quite logical to assume that any follow-up government will prioritize US interests over European interests. So it makes no sense to pay for outsiders who would work against you.France does a few things right; scandinavian countries too (I include The Netherlands here, though they are not really scandiavians but in their decision-making, they are often a bit like a hybrid between France and Denmark or Sweden). Spain and Italy lag behind but sometimes, surprisingly, also do the right thing. The real troublemaker is ... Germany. For a reason nobody understands, Germany is like an US satellite in everything it does, but only ... half-hearted. Naturally, \"the economy\" is one reason (export centric country so it is readily blackmailable by the USA here) but even then you have to ask why german politicians have absolutely no pride at all. France has pride - that's good and bad but good in this context. (UK is more an US colony really after Brexit anyway, with Farage probably going to win - and cause more damage.

It suggests that an enforcement agency believes that there is evidence of a crime at the offices.As a former IT/operations guy I'd guess they want on-prem servers with things like email and shared storage, stuff that would hold internal discussions about the thing they were interested in, but that is just my guess based on the article saying this is related to the earlier complaint that Grok was generating CSAM on demand.",

It’s solid for scripting and small projects.I tried it on a mid-size codebase (~50k LOC), and the context window filled up almost immediately, making it basically unusable unless you’re extremely explicit about which files to touch. I tested it with a 8k context window but will try again with 32k and see if it becomes more practical.I think the main blocker for using local coding models more is the context window. A lot of work is going into making small models “smarter,” but for agentic coding that only gets you so far. No matter how smart the model is, an agent will blow through the context as soon as it reads a handful of files.",

Mine is \"local network\". so call it the \"LAN model\" until we come up with something better. \"Self-host\" exists but this usually means more \"open-weights\" as opposed to clamping the performance of the model.It should be defined as ~sub-$10k, using Steve Jobs megapenny unit.Essentially classify things as how many megapennies of spend a machine is that won't OOM on it.That's what I mean when I say local: running inference for 'free' somewhere on hardware I control that's at most single digit thousands of dollars.

There's plenty of \"good enough\" models out there for a large category of every day tasks, now I want to find out what runs the bestTake a gen6 thinkpad P14s/macbook pro and a 5090/mac studio, run the benchmark and then we can say something like \"time-to-first-token/token-per-second/memory-used/total-time-of-test\" and rate this as independent from how accurate the model was.",

It's definitely useful for smaller project, scaffolding, basic bug fixes, extra UI tweaks etc.I don't think \"usable\" a binary thing though. I know you write lot about this, but it'd be interesting to understand what you're asking the local models to do, and what is it about what they do that you consider unusable on a relative monster of a laptop?",

Most cost comparisons assume perfect execution, but tool-calling agents fail parsing, need validation retries, etc. I've seen retry rates push effective costs 40-60% above baseline projections.Local models trading 50x slower inference for $0 marginal cost start looking very attractive for high-volume, latency-tolerant workloads.",

Third parties are running these models and you are just sending them all your code...with a code of conduct promise from OpenRouter?I also don't think there needs to be a huge improvement in models. Opus feels somewhat close to the reasonable limit: useful, still outputs nonsense, misses things sometimes...there are open models that can reach the same 95th percentile but the median is just the model outputting complete nonsense and trying to wipe your file system.The day for open models will come but it still feels so close and so far.",

You can't just pipe heat out into the atmosphere or build a heat exchanger. You can't exchange heat with vacuum.  You can only radiate heat into it.Heat is going to limit the compute that can be done in a satellite data centre and radiative cooling solutions are going to massively increase weight. It makes far more sense to build data centers in the arctic.Musk is up to something here.  This could be another hyperloop (i.e. A distracting promise meant to sabotage competition).

Most of advertised savings come not from placing the data centre in space, but the fact that advocates have argued away the need for absolutely everything that modern data centres are designed to supply, except for the compute.If they can really build a space data centre satellite for as cheap as they claim, why launch it? Just drive it out into the middle of the desert and dump it there. It can access the internet via starlink, and already has solar panels for power and radiators for cooling. IMO, If it can cool itself in direct sunlight in space, it can cool itself in the desert.The main thing that space gains you over setting up the same satellite in the desert is ~23 hours of power, vs the ~12 hours of power on the ground. And you suddenly gain the ability to repair the satellite. The cost of the launch would have to be extremely cheap before the extra 11ish hours of runtime per day outweighed the cost of a launch; Just build twice as many \"ground satellites\".And that's with a space optimised design. We can gain even more cost savings by designing proper distributed datacenter elements. You don't need lightweight materials, just use steel. You can get rid of the large radiators and become more reliant on air cooling. You can built each element bigger, because you don't have to fit the rocket dimensions. You could even add a wind turbine, so your daily runtime isn't dependant on daylight hours. Might even be worth getting rid of solar and optimising for wind power instead.An actual ground optimised design should be able to deliver the same functionality as the space data centre, for much cheaper costs. And it's this ground optimised distributed design that space data centres should be compared to, not today's datacenter which are hyper-optimised for pre-AI use cases.-------------------Space data centres are nothing more than a cool Sci-Fi solution looking for a problem. There have been mumblings for years, but they were never viable (even bitcoin mining was a bit too latency sensitive). Space data centre advocates have been handed a massive win with this recent AI boom, it's the perfect problem for their favourite solution to solve.But because it's a solution looking for a problem, they are completely blind to other solutions that might be an even better fit.",

This means if you are not careful with the surface of a satellite it can end up being very slowly cooked by sunlight alone not including running any higher heat producing component (as it absorbs more heat from sunlight then it emits, there is a reason satellites are mostly white, silver or reflective gold in color). Sure better surface materials fix that, but not to a point where you would want to run any heavy compute on it.3. zero repair-ability, most long running satellites have a lot of redundancy. Also at least if you are bulk buying Nvidea GPGPUs on single digit Million Euro basis it's not rare that 30% have some level of defect. Not necessary \"fully broken\" but \"performs less good then it should/compared to other units\" kind of broken.4. radiation/solar wind protections are a huge problem.

I think Starlink has been using Si cells instead of III-V-based ones, but in addition to lower output they also tend to degrade faster under radiation. I guess that's ok if the GPU is going to be toast in a few years anyway so you might as well de-orbit the whole thing. But that same solar cell on Earth will happily be producing for 40+ years.Also the same issue with radiative cooling pops up for space solar cells - they tend to run way hotter than on Earth and that lowers their efficiency relative to what you could get terrestrially.",

I do not have a CS degree. I learned via MIT OCW in a hospital hallway to pay for my wife's delivery bills. That night, code became my survival mechanism.Why I am an Outlier:The \"Revenge\" Build (Why I built my own IaC SDK) I applied to Pulumi. They loved my technical manifesto but rejected me due to \"Wrong Region.\" I did not give up. I built reactor-dev from scratch in 2-3 months (Drift detection, K8s reconcile loops).The Validation: A major EV Tech Giant rejected me (no degree), yet they cloned my private repo 13 times to study the architecture. Engineers validated the code, even if HR rejected the person.Frugal Engineering (The $5 vs $500 Mindset) I am building a social graph backend (DNA Platform) solo. I have no VC money for Cloud DBs.Solution: I architected a custom Kvrocks + RAMDisk engine with UUIDv7 sorting.Result: Reduced infra costs from ~$500/mo to $5/mo (100x reduction). 1000 retries dropped to 0.Resilience I have been rejected by WorldQuant, Nvidia, and Zalo purely for \"No Degree.\" Yet, I continue to ship production-grade distributed systems.What I am looking for: I am not looking for a \"stable job\" to hide in. I am looking for a Founder/CTO who values execution over credentials. If you need an engineer who treats your infrastructure budget like their own grocery money, let's talk.",

If there's no ability to trace a drone or robot, god only knows what could happen.Kidnappings, murders, terrorism. It seems like this might become \"easy\".How hard is it going to be to kill off political opponents in the future? Putin, for instance, enjoys relative freedom of movement because it's hard to get close to him.Once you can throw a drone into a field or rooftop and have it \"sleep\" for months until some \"awake\" command, then it operates entirely autonomously - that's cheap, easy to plan, and potentially impossible to track.Some disgruntled guy buys some fertilizer, a used van, and comma.ai?We potentially have a very, very different world coming soon.",

Actually, building a functional FCU that can strike a bullet primer, or a barrel that can be used once is not difficult at all and if you look around you can find videos of people that have tested that with a mixture of 3d printing and rudimentary metal working skills. The major issues on designing those parts are reliability and safety.

Much as I think we should regulate firearms, I despise how the Constitution’s interstate commerce clause has been horribly abused to cover intrastate ownership. See, by making your own gun, you didn’t import one from another state, so therefore the Feds should be involved because it involves interstate commerce now.For example[0]:> Filburn was penalized under the Act. He argued that the extra wheat that he had produced in violation of the law had been used for his own use and thus had no effect on interstate commerce, since it never had been on the market. In his view, this meant that he had not violated the law because the additional wheat was not subject to regulation under the Commerce Clause.…> The Court reasoned that Congress could regulate activity within a single state under the Commerce Clause, even if each individual activity had a trivial effect on interstate commerce, as long as the intrastate activity viewed in the aggregate would have a substantial effect on interstate commerce.So don’t assume that just because it never crosses state lines that it escapes federal law, however utterly freaking ridiculous that may be.0: https://www.oyez.org/cases/1940-1955/317us111",

Forces generally beyond your access will demand that your code is able to conform to platform standards. The demand this places can be very variable and depends more on the platform than you. (Windows has low platform churn since it's possible to futz with compat features, Linux is extremely variable on your codebase, MacOS is fairly constant and from what I know about mobile phones, you're basically signing up to forever maintenance duty).The latter is much more common; sure, sudo still gets updates but most of those won't be new features. Specification wise, sudo is \"done\". It does what it needs to, it's interface is defined and there aren't going to be any strange surprises when I run sudo between any system made in the past 10 years or so.The problem is that when you're selling software, demanding compensation for the former is a hard sell since it's things customers won't see or necessarily care about.

Mind blowingly hard to understand the source code but I credit my efforts then with later  finding AWK so easy and logical. IBM had also just brought out the baby System36 which looked like a PC beige box but was actually a minified s/36  if I recall correctly. Didn't sell well. Then there was RPG for DOS which I heard of but didn't use.If the authors client had been using an RPG accounting system for 40 years then it might be BPCS and there were tools out there to convert RPG to other less traumatic languages.But fascinating article nonetheless and brought back memories of being an apps programmer. I also remember those dongles.  Really fun when you had multiple apps with their own dongles and only one port.",

The reason why this is not more common is because the more iterations you do, the harder is to create those iterations, which means you add a lot of time to create the protection which means that you need to have a finished code, and code is always modified by production team, so managers see this overtime unnecessary.",

Unlike the assembly trick, this requires 0 programming expertise beyond the ability to type `strings` on the command line.This works because some programs use a hashing algorithm to calculate the key based on the name, do a strcmp, and pop a messagebox if the keys don't match, without zeroizing the valid key buffer first. If the key buffers are on the stack (or if the two mallocs just happen to use the same region in memory), it is often easy to find a valid key if you know where the invalid one is.I guess software that derives keys this way is far less common than it once was, but I know of somebody who cracked something using this method just a few years ago, so it still pops up from time to time.",

It is fair and reasonable to demand that environmental regulation justify its existence with hard, scientifically verifiable data or else get chopped. Clearly, banning leaded gasoline has that kind of justification, and therefore I'm strongly in favor of maintaining that ban and extending it wherever it isn't in place yet.

For example antitrust enforcement harms shareholders and some employees of very large firms, but it helps many employees and arguably improves the landscape for competition between many smaller firms.

There's some vaporized lead, most if it will move downrange and some of it won't. Airborne lead is potentially more of a problem at an indoor range.Copper, polymer-coated, or total metal jacket rounds will also result in less lead on the firearm, I'd think, and less on the user's hands.

I proposed[0] \"kitribytes\", \"metribytes\", \"gitribytes\", etc. Just because \"kilo\" has a meaning in one context doesn't mean we're stuck with it in others. It's not as though the ancient Greeks originally meant \"kilo\" to mean \"exactly 1,000\". \"Giga\" just meant \"giant\". \"Tera\" is just \"monster\". SI doesn't have sole ownership for words meaning \"much bigger than we can possibly count at a glance\".Donald Knuth himself said[1]:> The members of those committees deserve credit for raising an important issue, but when I heard their proposal it seemed dead on arrival --- who would voluntarily want to use MiB for a maybe-byte?! So I came up with the suggestion above, and mentioned it on page 94 of my Introduction to MMIX. Now to my astonishment, I learn that the committee proposals have actually become an international standard. Still, I am extremely reluctant to adopt such funny-sounding terms; Jeffrey Harrow says \"we're going to have to learn to love (and pronounce)\" the new coinages, but he seems to assume that standards are automatically adopted just because they are there.If Gordon Bell and Gene Amdahl used binary sizes -- and they did -- and Knuth thinks the new terms from the pre-existing units sound funny -- and they do -- then I feel like I'm in good company on this one.0: https://honeypot.net/2017/06/11/introducing-metric-quantity....1: https://www-cs-faculty.stanford.edu/~knuth/news99.html",

This product catalog [0] from 1979 shows them marketing the corresponding disks as \"100 million bytes\" or \"200 million bytes\" (3336 mdl 1 and 3336 mdl 11, respectively). By 1984, those same disks were marketed in the \"IBM Input/Output Device Summary\"[1] (which was intended for a customer audience) as \"100MB\" and \"200MB\"0: (PDF page 281) \"IBM 3330 DISK STORAGE\" http://electronicsandbooks.com/edt/manual/Hardware/I/IBM%20w...1: (PDF page 38, labeled page 2-7, Fig 2-4) http://electronicsandbooks.com/edt/manual/Hardware/I/IBM%20w...Also, hats off to http://electronicsandbooks.com/ for keeping such incredible records available for the internet to browse.-------Edit: The below is wrong. Older experience has corrected me - there has always been ambiguity (perhaps bifurcated between CPU/OS and storage domains). \"And that with such great confidence!\", indeed.-------The article presents wishful thinking. The wish is for \"kilobyte\" to have one meaning. For the majority of its existence, it had only one meaning - 1024 bytes. Now it has an ambiguous meaning. People wish for an unambiguous term for 1000 bits, however that word does not exist. People also might wish that others use kibibyte any time they reference 1024 bytes, but that is also wishful thinking.The author's wishful thinking is falsely presented as fact.I think kilobyte was the wrong word to ever use for 1024 bytes, and I'd love to go back in time to tell computer scientists that they needed to invent a new prefix to mean \"1,024\" / \"2^10\" of something, which kilo- never meant before kilobit / kilobyte were invented. Kibi- is fine, the phonetics sound slightly silly to native English speakers, but the 'bi' indicates binary and I think that's reasonable.I'm just not going to fool myself with wishful thinking. If, in arrogance or self-righteousness, one simply assumes that every time they see \"kilobyte\" it means 1,000 bytes - then they will make many, many failures. We will always have to take care to verify whether \"kilobyte\" means 1,000 or 1,024 bytes before implementing something which relies on that for correctness.",

But for quantity, binary seems better.

This doesn't mean we tweak the meter to conform to observational results as we'd all be happier if light really was 300 000KM/s instead of ~299 792km/s.Then there's the problem of not mixing different measurement units. SI was designed to conform all measurements to the same base 10 exponents (cm, m, km versus feet inches and yards) But the authors attempt to resolve this matter doesn't even conform to standardised SI units as we would expect them to.What is a byte? Well, 8 bits, sometimes.\nWhat is a kilobit? 1000 Bits\nWhat is a kilobyte? 1000 Bytes, or 1024 Bytes.Now we've already mixed units based on what a bit or a byte even is and the addition of the 8 multiplier in addition to the exponent of 1000 or 1024.And if you think, hey, at least the bit is the least divisible unit of information, That's not even correct. If there Should* be a reformalisation of information units, you would agree that the amount of \"0\"'s is the least divisible unit of information. A kilo of zero's, would be 1000. A 'byte' would be defined as containing up to 256 zero's. A Megazero would contain up to a million zero's.It wouldn't make any intuitive sense for anyone to count 0's, which would automatically convert your information back to base 10, but it does prove that the most sensible unit of information is already what we've had before, that is, you're not mixing bytes (powers of 2) with SI-defined units of 1000",

Early diskettes always used 1000, only when the 8 bit home computer era started was the 1024 convention firmly established.Before that it made no sense to talk about kilo as 1024. Earlier computers measured space in records and words, and I guess you can see how in 1960, no one would use kilo to mean 1024 for a 13 bit computer with 40 byte records. A kiloword was, naturally, 1000 words, so why would a kilobyte be 1024?1024 bearing near ubiquitous was only the case in the 90s or so - except for drive manufacturing and signal processing. Binary prefixes didn't invent the confusion, they were a partial solution.

Crude oil is traded in barrels but gasoline is dispensed in gallons. Everyone thinks their usage of units and numbers is intuitive and optimal, and everyone refuses to change.In the metric(ish) world, I still see many tensions. The micron is a common alternate name for the micrometre, yet why don't we have a millin or nanon or picon? The solution is to eliminate the micron. I've seen the angstrom (0.1 nm) in spectroscopy and in the discussion of CPU transistor sizes, yet it diverts attention away from the picometre. The bar (100 kPa) is popular in talking about things like tire pressure because it's nearly 1 atmosphere. The mmHg is a unit of pressure that sounds metric but is not; the correct unit is pascal. No one in astronomy uses mega/giga/tera/peta/etc.-metres; instead they use AU and parsec and (thousand, million, billion) light-years. Particle physics use eV/keV/MeV instead of some units around the picojoule.Having a grab bag of units and domains that don't talk to each other is indeed the natural state of things. To put your foot down and say no, your industry does not get its own special snowflake unit, stop that nonsense and use the standardized unit - that takes real effort to achieve.",

Because humans.Binary addressing made sense for RAM.  Especially since it makes decoding address lines into chip selects (or slabs of core, or whatever) a piece of cake, having chips be a round number in binary made life easier for everyone.Then early DOS systems (CP/M comes to mind particularly) mapped disk sectors to RAM regions, so to enable this shortcut, disk sectors became RAM-shaped.  The 512-byte sector was born.  File sizes can be written in bytes, but what actually matters is how many sectors they take up.  So file sizing inherited this shortcut.But these shortcuts never affected \"real computers\", only the hamstrung crap people were running at home.So today we have multiple ecosystems.

Just enough to answer \"is this relevant?\" You can inject all glances into every prompt because they're tiny. The LLM scans them like a table of contents.CARD.yml is the interface layer, 50-200 lines. No implementation, just what the skill offers Capability advertisements, activation conditions, scoring, what it composes with. Think of it like The Sims \"advertisement\" system or CLOS generic function dispatch. The LLM sniffs this to decide whether to load the full SKILL.md implementation.SKILL.md is the Anthropic-style skill file, 200-1000 lines. The actual instructions, the how. Only loaded when the skill is activated.README.md is the largest, 500+ lines, and it's for humans. History, design rationale, examples. The LLM can dive in when developing the skill or when curious, but it's not burned on every invocation.Reading rule: never load a lower level without first loading the level above.

A skill can wrap a sister-script that IS the documentation. A Python script with argparse defines the CLI once, readable by both humans (--help) and LLMs (sniff the top of the python file). No separate docs to maintain, no drift between what the code does and what the docs claim.sister-script: https://github.com/SimHacker/moollm/blob/main/skills/sister-...Sniffable-python structures code so the API is visible in the first 50 lines. Imports, constants, CLI structure up front. Implementation below the fold. The LLM can decide relevance and understand the API without reading the whole file. Single source of truth, progressive disclosure, don't repeat yourself.sniffable-python README.md: https://github.com/SimHacker/moollm/blob/main/skills/sniffab...sniffable-python SKILL.md: https://github.com/SimHacker/moollm/blob/main/skills/sniffab...",

Everything more specific is in a skill, which is mostly some very light touch instructions for how to use various tools we have (scripts, apis and mcps).I have found that people very often add _way_ to much information into claude.md's and skills.  Claude knows a lot of stuff already!  Keep your information to things specific whatever you are working on that it doesn't already know.  If your internal processes and house style are super complicated to explain to claude and it keeps making mistakes, you might want to adapt to claude instead of the other way around.

Placing the AI functionality on the left sidebar makes no sense; all the other tools on the left are project management; the \"let me run weird functions and interact with stuff\" UIs like terminal, debug and logs are in the bottom panel. Or maybe a new tab in the main workspace area?The SwiftUI preview canvas can't be floated as a separate window, making it all but useless on anything smaller than a 16\" MBP (and only barely usable there). In fact, I think it might be impossible to use Xcode in multiple screens altogether…?Old simulator versions and cache files hang around forever, you need a third-party app like DevCleaner just to keep your storage from filling with nonsense. Cryptic messages like \"copying symbols to device\"… clear-cache that doesn't seem to clear-cache, that stupid list UI for info.plist…I never thought I'd have anything nice to say about PNPM package management, but you can always just delete `node_modules` and reinstall and count on things working. Swift package management is a cryptic mess, and their insistence on using a GUI instead of a basic JSON manifest just compounds it. Like the info.plist thing, a lot of Xcode is based on a developer UI philosophy from the Mac Classic days that has mostly been abandoned by the rest of the world.Mostly, I think the vitriol surrounding Xcode is that Apple seems to think they're doing a good job; meanwhile their most ardent and adept users are insisting that they are not.

Not only is the property panel missing half of options we now take for granted everywhere else (like corner radius), it also randomly won't read fonts in the current project, will crash the entire IDE if you Cmd-Z a big change (things like unembedding a view) and half the UI is still not rendered the way it will be on the phone. Yes, Swift UI exists, but most bigger apps are still XIBs and Storyboards and it's going to remain that way for quite some time.- Autocomplete is a hit or miss. Very much like the mid-90s Microsoft IDEs where you'd get totally useless results until you've typed the whole line out already. It can be done well, look at AppCode.- Syntax highlighting feels pretty much the same. Randomly flashes on and off, often doesn't highlight until return is pressed, takes a long time to load on large files etc.- Git integration is by far the worst I've seen out of any IDE and I've seen many. I'd go as far as to say that SourceSafe integration in VB6 was done better. Just the whole layout, modal-on-modal returning to the first modal on an error in the second and so on. It's crashed when rebasing a few times too, I don't trust it with larger operations since.- Documentation browser is this annoying little window with semi-useful search. But don't worry, the docs in there are useless anyways. I could go on and on about their approach to docs but maybe next time.Don't even get me started on performance. Things like switching file tabs should be instant by now but there are still noticeable delays for larger files and IB screens.

This problem seems to go back to the ancient times, but it gets worse and worse the bloatier macOS UI processes become (e.g. the more system frameworks they load at start).The debugger variable view panel is so bare bones that it looks like it's ripped out straight from an 80's home computer monitor program.When debug-stepping, the debugger frontend is quite often stuck for 10s of seconds at completely unpredictable places waiting for the debugger to respond (it feels like a timeout).Step-debugging in general feels sluggish even compared to VSCode with lldb.For comparison, VS2026 isn't exactly a lightweight IDE either, but debugging sessions start instantly, debug-stepping is immediate, and the CPU debugger is much more feature rich than Xcode's.

Then I had to learn XCode for a mobile app.It was a surreal experience, like going back ten years in UX, while at the same time dealing with a myriad of modern but artificial limitations and breaking changes that meant the app needed frequent housekeeping even when its features remained unchanged.For a company that gets a huge part of its revenue on its oversized App Store tax, developers, and their tooling, should be one of their highest priorities IMO. Instead, we get Kafkaesque situations like \"my app doesn't compile today... oh, I need to open my Apple Developer account in the browser and accept a new little change in their kilometric EULA that I always pretend I've read carefully\". Things like this could be handled better.Edit: I also had to learn Android Studio for another app, and the experience had less friction overall, but that could mean that I've also learned to work around the shortcomings of JetBrains IDEs.

Take something most of your audience already agrees with, triple down on some reductionist caricature of it, and smother it in pithy glibness. The shorter the better.

It's a reflexive style of engagement for many, and HN is not immune to it.I aim to avoid it these days, with varying degrees of success. I don't need fictitious internet points, I want to hear other people's genuine thoughts on a subject of interest. Or sometimes just to share something I thought was neat.But since all social media are Pavlovian conditioning for points, you rarely get any fruitful exchange. And it seems to be getting rarer and rarer, sadly.I wonder how one would structure social media to avoid it. HN is good, but the karma system is a double edged sword. Would it increase the quality of the discussion to retain the use of points for ranking posts, but hide point counts completely? Perhaps they could be represented by words: \"Positive response\", \"negative response\", but only past -3 and +3, with no changes in wording beyond that score?",

I feel like a lot of people have some great ideas to expand upon & I feel like they should play around with clickhouse playground for themselves! Highly recommended (also the reason why I referenced them in the website a lot)Also, another point, but the data's not completely 1:1 but pretty close, I think the HN comments references till 6 january 2026 when I had run a date like query on it, but pretty close if you ask me & Clickhouse updates their database a lot from what I can feel like.A bit of a backstory but I first wanted to try it with algolia api. Found the 10_000 requests per ip per hour to be really restricting. Then thought of using the big query data but it was really hard to play with that & I really couldn't understand how to really use it (a bit of skill issue), I also tried looking at firebase api of HN itself but found that it also had rate limits from what I can tell which wouldn't have been so useful.I then found a HN comment about someone from clickhouse when searching to find that they had the play.clickhouse feature and then I remembered playing with that/being familiar with it from some time ago as well so decided to build on top of it.The most interesting part was that when I was running it on browser & it ran. I felt like it would be a huge job to create an api. (I was thinking of having a puppeeter instance on my netcup vps) but then I simply took the request from network and pasted it in gemini to simplify it (remove all the browser things so that it can work in curl as when I pasted it directly in curl, it had issues) and it gave me a curl command which when I ran actually gave just the table itself. I wasn't really expecting this but it made the whole process even smoother and was thus capable of being able to run on github pages.Clickhouse's pretty awesome from what I can tell :] (Wish I was sponsored xD)Honestly, Tried to find if clickhouse has any merch but couldn't find any. Oh well, I might as well still print a sticker of clickhouse and paste it on my mac because I found it really cool for olap.

Almost all the largest and best open source projects out there have substantial involvement from commercial interests.I do think though that from a structural/governance perspective it's not a good idea for Anki to be owned by AnkiHub. Anki is a community project, not a corporate product, and while it sounds like the license will continue to reflect that, I personally think it would be best if the corporate structure did too. If Anki were spun out as an independent foundation (like Blender, Linux, etc) receiving most of its support and development work from AnkiHub, rather than owned outright, I think that would allow a much more robust governance structure than just having everything be under AnkiHub's direct control with some pinky promises about listening to the community.",

If you've been a part of the /r/medicalschoolanki subreddit, you know exactly what I mean. It's been hollowed out completely.In the post, AnkiHub mentions how Anki is \"sacred\" to them. Yet, they have had no qualms entrenching themselves into Anki's settings menu as the only third-party ever to do so. [1] I am sure more is to come. And the language used in their post almost never helps their case, especially in the pricing and OSS sections.I understand why Damien felt he was being a bottleneck in Anki's development. This is similar to what was happening with Bram and Vim. Ultimately, the community forked and built Neovim. Gorhill had also similarly transferred uBlock, but then came back and built uBlock Origin. So the precedents are there for a successful community-run or leader-run spinoff.Syncing is sure to become a paid feature, and access to shared decks too.Creating a fork pointed to a hosted version of Sync Server [2], and an alternative hub where people can share decks other than AnkiWeb [3] is paramount. As well as saving and preserving all of the decks there, as they are sure to go behind a paywall.I, and I am sure many other HNers, would be willing to support that with our time and financially.[0] https://www.ankihub.net/about-us\n[1] https://github.com/ankitects/anki/pull/3232\n[2] https://docs.ankiweb.net/sync-server.html\n[3] https://ankiweb.net/shared/decks",

It is good to be able to practice known words less often, obviously, but that can be achieved using a very basic system already.If changing their SPS or the promises about an SPS motivate the learner, then great, they're putting in the work and time to learn, but I doubt that the effect of changing the SPS is as large as some people claim.For example I used a tool that supposedly uses FSPS, but it did have a low maximum for the duration you don't have to practice a word, and no way for me to \"ban\" a word, so that it asks me in 6 months or something, and simple words kept coming back, especially after not learning for a few days.

First of all, processing HTML with regex can be perfectly acceptable depending on what you're trying to do. Yes, this doesn't include full-blown \"parsing\" of arbitrary HTML, but there are plenty of ways in which you might want to process or transform HTML that either don't require producing a parse tree, don't require perfect accuracy, or are operating on HTML whose structure is constrained and known in advance. Second, it doesn't even attempt to explain to OP why parsing arbitrary HTML with regex is impossible or poorly-advised.The OP didn't want his post to be taken over by someone hamming it up with an attempt at creative writing.

Computers have been powerful enough for productivity tasks for 20 years, excepting browser-based software.The two main problems I ran into were 1) software support at the application layer, and 2) video driver support. There is a herculean effort on the part of package maintainers to build software for distros, and no one has been building 32 bit version of software for years, even if it is possible to build from source. There is only a very limited set of software you can use, even CLI software because so many things are built with 64 bit dependencies. Secondly, old video card drivers are being dropped from the kernel. This means all you have is basic VGA \"safe-mode\" level support, which isn't even fast enough to play an MPEG2. My final try was to install Debian 5, which was period correct and had support for my hardware, but the live CDs of the the time were not hybrid so the ISO could not boot from USB. I didn't have a burner so I finally gave up.So I think these types of projects are fun for a proof of concept, but unfortunately are never going to give life to old computers.",

I am just one guy without a CS degree, so for now, this project is based on antiX 23 i386. AntiX is a fantastic distribution that I think shares much of the same spirit as the original DSL project. AntiX shares pedigree with MEPIS and also leans heavily on the geniuses at Debian. So, this project stands on the shoulders of giants. In other words, DSL 2024 is a humble little project!Though it may seem comparably ridiculous that 700MB is small in 2024 when DSL was 50MB in 2002, I’ve done a lot of hunting to find small footprint applications, and I had to do some tricks to get a workable desktop into the 700MB limit. To get the size down the ISO currently reduced full language support for German, English, French, Spanish, Portuguese and Brazilian Portuguese (de_DE, en_AU, en_GB, en_US, es_ES, fr_FR, es_ES, pt_PT, & pt_BR ).

FAT12 is not a journaling filesystem. On a modern drive, a crash during a write is at best, annoying while on a 3.5\" floppy with a 33mhz CPU, a write operation blocks for a perceptible amount of time. If the user hits the power switch or the kernel panics while the heads are moving or the FAT is updating, that disk is gone. The article mentions sync, but sync on a floppy drive is an agonizingly slow operation that users might interrupt.Given the 253KiB free space constraint, I wonder if a better approach would be treating the free space as a raw block device or a tiny appended partition using a log-structured filesystem designed for slow media (like a stripped down JFFS2 or something), though that might require too many kernel modules.Has anyone out there experimented with appending a tar archive to the end of the initramfs image inplace for persistence, rather than mounting the raw FAT filesystem? It might be safer to serialize writes only on shutdown, would love more thoughts on this.",

          "content": "This is the second article about hardware supply from China I've read and it reads very much the same, albiet in a different niche (the other one was about SBC construction) -Anything you don't specify will be done least cost, and there is no amount of \"least\" which cannot be chased in manufacture.The other one noted if you don't specify the density of plastic for bags, or paper for bags and packing, you get clingfilm thinner than you thought existed, and paper which is almost tissue in its weakness. You don't even get boxes to put the boxes in, if you don't specify boxes to be delivered in boxes. So now wrapping a pallet becomes a nightmare if they don't stack. And if you don't specify how many to stack, and how to pad the stack, they won't do unit height stacking if it costs labour time. Your risk.Some of this like the casting mistake, or the knob thing, could happen anywhere and you have to be close to final manufacture spec to find out e.g. the metal coating impinges on the knob at the free space you specified, because your test rig didn't have powder coating. Or, that a design feature you need like the light entry holes, is used by the casting engineer as pour points because it looked like you'd specified mould pour points not functional holes.But other things like \"yea, you didn't spec how long to make the tails so we cut the tails as close as we could\" is just the cheapening above: if you don't SAY its a 10cm tail for the connector, it will be 2cm, if saving 8cm of cable saves money for them.I've read some stuff which says the cost of 5 SBC boards with pre-applied SMD is now so low, you might as well order 5 so you get at least 1 which works. That means they will wind up working out your tolerance for failure, and produce goods to meet that: if 1 in 5 is viable, thats what they'll target.",

      "abstract": "该讨论围绕Anthropic公司旗下AI服务Claude的宕机事件展开。用户普遍反映Claude服务不稳定，频繁出现错误和响应缓慢问题，甚至有用户对比指出其宕机频率高于OpenAI和Google的同类服务。部分用户认为大语言模型已趋于同质化，切换成本很低，宕机时可轻松改用其他工具；也有用户指出Claude尽管在编程方面表现优秀，但客户端体验差、存在随机限制，基础设施显得脆弱。讨论中提到，有用户建议可借机尝试本地模型替代方案，还有Anthropic可靠性团队成员出面道歉并承诺进行复盘。共识在于Claude的服务稳定性亟待改进，分歧则体现在对宕机影响的容忍度不同：有人认为这只是轻微不便，也有工程师用户强烈批评其可靠性问题。",

      "abstract": "该讨论围绕rclone与rsync在文件同步性能上的对比展开。核心话题是rclone通过多线程并行传输实现比rsync更快的网络文件同步速度，但社区对此存在不同看法。\n\n有人认为rclone的并行流传输确实能提升速度，尤其适用于高速网络环境或存在硬件瓶颈的场景。也有用户指出，rsync本身可通过脚本实现并行传输，且其增量同步和硬链接处理能力在节省带宽方面具有优势，配合SSH协议更灵活通用。讨论中提到，部分用户肯定rclone的实用性，甚至基于它开发了云存储迁移服务，但另一些用户抱怨其在某些云平台（如Google Photos）的兼容性下降或配置复杂。\n\n分歧主要在于工具选择：一方更看重传输速度，另一方则强调带宽效率与跨平台可靠性。共识在于，两者各有适用场景，用户需根据具体需求（如数据量、网络条件、功能侧重）进行选择。",

It almost always indicates some bottleneck in the application or TCP tuning. (Though, very fast links can overwhelm slow hardware, and ISPs might do some traffic shaping too, but this doesn't apply to local links).SSH was never really meant to be a high performance data transfer tool, and it shows. For example, it has a hardcoded maximum receive buffer of 2MiB (separate from the TCP one), which drastically limits transfer speed over high BDP links (even a fast local link, like the 10gbps one the author has). The encryption can also be a bottleneck. hpn-ssh [1] aims to solve this issue but I'm not so sure about running an ssh fork on important systems.1. https://github.com/rapier1/hpn-ssh",

Like, I know it's not E2EE the same way to send unencrypted data to one OPNsense router, Wireguard (or Nebula or whatever tunnel you prefer) to another over the internet, and then from there to a NAS. But if the NAS is in the same physically secure rack directly attached by hardline to the router (or via isolated switch), I don't think in practice it's significantly enough less secure at the private service level to matter. If the router is a pretty important lynchpin anyone, it can be favorable to lean more heavily on that so one can go cheaper and lower power elsewhere. Not that more efficiency, hardware acceleration etc are at all bad, and conversely sometimes might make sense to have a powerful NAS/other servers and a low power router, but there are good degrees of freedom there. Handier then ever in the current crazy times where sometimes hardware that was formerly easily and cheaply available is now a king's ransom or gone and one has to improvise.",

I don't fully grasp why it doesn't just use that to extend as needed.I also found that there's an official `no-flow-control` extension with the description> channel behaves as if all window sizes are infinite.\n>\n> This extension is intended for, but not limited to, use by file transfer applications that are only going to use one channel and for which the flow control provided by SSH is an impediment, rather than a feature.So this looks exactly as designed for rsync.

The savings depend on how and where they differ, and ofcourse there's tradeoffs...You seem to be referring to the selection of candidates of files to transfer (along several possible criteria like modification time, file size or file contents using checksumming) [2]Rsync is great. However for huge filesystems (many files and directories) with relatively less change, you'll need to think about \"assisting\" it somewhat (by feeding it its candidates obtained in a more efficient way, using --files-from=). For example: in a renderfarm system you would have additions of files, not really updates. Keep a list of frames that have finished rendering (in a cinematic film production this could be eg. 10h/frame), and use it to feed rsync. Otherwise you'll be spending hours for rsync to build its index (both sides) over huge filesystems, instead of transferring relatively few big and new files.In workloads where you have many sync candidates (files) that have a majority of differing chunks, it might be worth rather disabling the delta-transfer algorithm (--whole-file) and saving on the tradeoffs.[0] https://www.andrew.cmu.edu/course/15-749/READINGS/required/c...[1] https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rsync#Determining_which_parts_...[2] https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rsync#Determining_which_files_...",

The client downloads the hashes, compares them to what it has then downloads the parts it is missing.With rsync, you upload hashes of what you have, then the source has to do all the hashing work to figure out what to send you. It's slightly more efficient, but If you are supporting even 10s of downloads it's a lot of work for the source.The other option is to send just a diff, which I believe e.g. Google Chrome does. Google invented Courgette and Zucchini which partially decompile binaries then recompile them on the other end to reduce the size of diffs. These only work for exact known previous versions, though.I wonder if the ideas of Courgette and Zucchini can be incorporated into zsync's hashes so that you get the minimal diff, but the flexibility of not having a perfect previous version to work from.",

So I know already how to build software but I'm not familiar with every language or framework. AI enabled me to write other kind of software I never learned or had time for. E.g. I recently re-implemented an android widget that has not been updated for a decade by it's original author. Or I fixed a bug in a linux scanner driver. None of these I could have done properly (within an acceptable time frame) without AI. But also none of there I could have done properly without my knowledge and experience, even with AI.Same for daily tasks at work. AI makes me faster here, but also makes me doing more. Implement tests for all edge cases? Sure, always, I saved the time before. More code reviews. More documentation. Better quality in the same (always limited) time.",

I had to ask it for two changes I think, but over all I barely got out of my regular work to get it done. I did know exactly what to ask of it because the IT business partners who had discovered the flaw had basically written the tasks already. Anyway. AI worked well there.Where AI fails us is when we build new software to improve the business related to solar energy production and sale. It fails us because the tasks are never really well defined. Or even if they are, sometimes developers or engineers come up with a better way to do the business process than what was planned for. AI can write the code, but it doesn't refuse to write the code without first being told why it wouldn't be a better idea to do X first. If we only did code-reviews then we would miss that step.In a perfect organisation your BPM people would do this. In the world I live in there are virtually no BPM people, and those who know the processes are too busy to really deal with improving them. Hell... sometimes their processes are changed and they don't realize until their results are measurably better than they used to be. So I think it depends a lot on the situation. If you've got people breaking up processes, improving them and then decribing each little bit in decent detail. Then I think AI will work fine, otherwise it's probably not the best place to go full vibe.",

(I think Travis Kalanick was experiencing this when he was talking about Vibe Physics.)But the thing is, it was ultimately an extension of your ideas, without your prompts, the ideas don’t exist.  It’s very library of babel esque.And so I wonder if coding assistants have this general problem.

But here's the kicker, you only get to know these issues once you started coding them by hand. You go through the variables and function calls and suddenly remember a process elsewhere changes or depends on these values.Unit tests could catch them in a decently architected system,  but those tests needs to be defined by the one coding it. Also if the architect himself is using AI, because why not, it's doomed from the start.",

In practice that means doing dumb things a lazy human would refuse because they know better, and then following those rabbit holes until they run out of imaginary dirt.My estimation is that that combination undermines their productivity potential without very structured application. Considering the excess and escalating costs of dealing with issues as they arise further from the developers work station (by factors of approximately 20x, 50x, and 200x+ as you get out through QA and into customer environments (IIRC)), you don’t need many screw ups to make the effort net negative.",

(Without implying that you shouldn't write it by hand or reason about it.) You need to debug and test it thoroughly either way, and basically be as sceptical of your own output as you'd be of any other person's output.Thinking that writing the code makes you understand it better can cause more issues than thinking that even if you write the code, you don't really know what it's doing. You are merely typing out the code based on what you think it should be doing, and reasoning against that hypothesis. Of course, you can be better or worse at constructing the correct mental model from the get go, and keep updating it in the right direction while writing the code. But it's a slippery slope, because it can also go the other way around.A lot of bugs that take unreasonably long for junior-mid level engineers to find, seem to happen because: They trust their own mental model of the code too much without verifying it thoroughly, create a hypothesis for the bug in their own head without verifying it thoroughly, then get lost trying to reason about a made up version of whatever is causing the bug only to come to the conclusion that their original hypothesis was completely wrong.",

      "abstract": "该讨论围绕Archive.today是否对某博客发起DDoS攻击展开。核心争议在于攻击行为的性质及背后复杂的网络冲突。有人认为DDoS行为明显不道德且无必要，并指出博客内容可能片面省略了前期交涉过程。也有用户指出事件涉及多重复杂因素，包括网络伪装、人肉搜索、心理操作乃至国际黑客活动，整体氛围类似信息战。讨论中提到Archive.today与Cloudflare因EDNS问题存在长期纠纷，这可能涉及隐私隐忧。部分用户从技术角度建议采用Cloudflare防护或设置严格CORS策略应对攻击。尽管事件背景错综复杂，社区普遍认同DDoS本身具有不正当性，但对于冲突根源、各方责任及事件全貌仍存在明显分歧。",

But the body doesn't matter here — the attack only requires the request be sent.But more to the point, so long as the request meets the requirements of a \"simple request\", CORS won't preflight it. GETs qualify as a simple request so long as no non-CORS-safelisted headers are sent; since the sent headers are attacker-controlled, we can just assume that to be the case. In a non-preflighted request, the CORS \"yes, let JS do this\" are just on the response headers of the actual request itself.Since GETs are idempotent, the browser assumes it safe to make the request. CORS could/would be used to deny JS access to the response.Things are this way b/c there are, essentially, a myriad of other ways to make the same request.

It was a conflict proxy, an artifact of the Cold War. Any technology was entirely incidental.The US has been talking about a return to the Moon for 50 years. George W Bush talked about it in 2004. It still hasn't happened. Artemis is limping along but it's entirely pork barrelling for the overly expensive SLS program that really no future.Some might say SpaceX will come to the rescue. That's... doubtful. Notably, Elon calls the Moon \"a distraction\" [1]. Why would he do this? It's free money from the government.The answer is actually pretty simple: Tsarship simply isn't designed for this mission type. Landing a Starship on the MOon is much more complex than, say, the LEM for the Apollo missions or the proposed Chinese lunar lander. If you could, your astronats would be 40 meters off the ground. The big advantage of a \"traditional\" lunar lander is it can't really topple over. Plus the Apollo LEM also had a very simple engine that could only ever be used once but the big advantage was that it was extremely difficult to fail.If you exclude all that, Starship is behind schedule and still requires developing technology that they haven't even begun to test, most notably in-orbit refueling.So why is China doing all this? I suspect it's mainly to develop their own reusable rocket program with a side of national pride. China is very concerned with their national security interests. Being able to launch things cheaply is a critical national security interest.Still, the mission architecture of China's mission (from what I've read) is still fairly complex, requiring two vehicles to rendezvous in lunar orbit. That's also why I think the primary goal is orbital launch capacity.[1]: https://x.com/elonmusk/status/1875023335891026324",

          "content": "What are the price variations like over short distances?In the US gasoline short distance price variations are ridiculous. I've seen it where one station was $3.50/gal and another station on the same main road just a 30 second drive away was $4.30/gal. These two stations almost always have a large difference like that. This kind of large difference over a small distance is common all over the country.Yet a surprisingly large number of people will always choose the more expensive station, even if they know about both of them (and the other stations with prices consistently in between that are also about equally close). There's nothing about the layout of the town and traffic patterns that make the expensive station more convenient, or make it easy to find. All these stations are about equally busy so it is not like the expensive one is faster. The less expensive one even has a way better convenience store.This is one of the higher gas price states and people are constantly complaining about how much it costs to fill up, and when I ask complainers about where they buy gas it is often the expensive stations.Many of them think that if they don't buy at the expensive station it will be bad for their car. Different brands add different detergents and additives that fight clogging and build up of deposits in your engine and fuel system.However in 1995 the US got a federal standard that all gas has to meet, and then in 2004 several major car makers developed a standard they called \"Top Tier\" which is about 20 times more effective than the federal standard. Most major gas brands now sell only gas that is certified to meet the Top Tier standard.Most testing has found that going for something beyond Top Tier doesn't really have a significant benefit for most people. For nearly everyone the best approach is:(1) Avoid gas that is not at least Top Tier. Generally the only places that sell gas that isn't at least Top Tier are grocery store brands and maybe some convenience store brands. The savings with those brands is usually only a couple or so cents a gallon compared to the least expensive Top Tier brands (ARCO, Costco) and your car will perform better (including improved mpg) and need less maintenance.(2) Buy the least expensive Top Tier or above gas that is convenient. You aren't going to notice any difference in performance or maintenance if you pay extra for some brand's particular proprietary blend.",

There are some edge cases of course.If you live on the Irish border, you'll have a choice between getting your petrol on the UK side, or the Irish side.

There are weird status things going on with purchases like this.Only the other day my father refused to buy some branded paracetamol because it was ~5 times more expensive than the local pharmacy brand that was out of stock. (£2.25 vs £0.49 for 16 500mg tablets.) I'd usually agree with him but he was out of paracetamol and has been advised by his doctor to take 2x500mg a day and there was no viable nearby alternative.A digression but for that generation (those born in 1940s/50s) that grew up with rationing I think it is hardwired into their brain to try and minimise the cost of so many things, but with lots of random exceptions. Later on that day he ordered an extra drink but decided he was too full once it had arrived so he left it. So he was worried about spending an extra £1.76 on paracetamol but not about spending £7 on a pint he didn't drink.Many people decide what petrol station to use based on simply how close it is, what kind of shop is attached to it (and the bits of British snobbery around that), whether it also sells whatever else they want (bread, milk, beer, etc), or even whether it is easy to drive in and out of.",

That code frequently calls LLMs itself, which means it needs API keys and network access.This isn’t the traditional “run untrusted plugins” problem. It’s deeper: LLM-generated code, calling external APIs with real credentials, without human review. Sandboxing the compute isn’t enough. You need to control network egress and protect secrets from exfiltration.Deno Sandbox provides both. And when the code is ready, you can deploy it directly to Deno Deploy without rebuilding.\"",

It works great.For data residency, i.e. making sure the service is EU bound, there is basically no other way. We can move the service anywhere we can get hardware virtualisation.As for the situation with credentials, our method is to generate CLIs on the fly and expose them to the LLMs and then they can shell script them whichever way they want. The CLIs only contain scoped credentials to our API which handles oauth and other forms of authentication transparently. The agent does not need to know anything about this. All they know is that they can do$ some-skillset search-gmail-messages -q \"emails from Adrian\"In our own experiments we find that this approach works better and it just makes sense given most of the latest models are trained as coding assistants. They just love bash, so give them the tools.",

Then they added mouse tracking, so we added mouse movement to our scripts.The most insidious part was that it was also an MLM… you would also get paid for usage by people you referred, too, and then even by people those people referred, with diminishing returns from each level. So like 1 cent an hour for my referrals and .5 cents an hour for their referral referrals.We were broke high school kids, so we put so much time and effort into recruiting people and getting them set up with the auto scripts. By the end we were making in the low 3 figure a month. We knew people who were making even more.Of course, it soon went out of business because of the dotcom bust as well as the ridiculous business model and rampant user fraud, but it was fun while it lasted.",

Many companies are a bit less sensitive to pricing and would rather pay monthly for someone else to keep their database up, rather than spending engineering hours on setting up a database, tuning it, updating it, checking its backups, monitoring it and making it scale if needed.Sure, any regular SME can just install Postgres or MySQL without even setting much up except with `mysql_secure_install`, a user with a password and an 'app' database.

So far with these edge database providers you don’t have a ton of say in how things are structured. To use them optimally, I have found it works best if you are doing database-per-tenant (or customer) scenarios or using it as a read / write cache that gets exfiltrated asynchronously.And that is where I believe the real cost factors come into play is the flexibility",

Bunny lets you choose how many and which regions to replicate across; Cloudflare's region replication is an on/off toggle that is in beta and requires you to use \"the new Sessions API\" (I don't know what this entails).The main reason I haven't tried out D1 is that it locks you into using Workers to access the database.

This has the same configuration in the IDE, but sometimes devs ignore IDE warnings or just open files in a text editor for a quick edit and don't see IDE warnings or w/e.\"Replaced by CI\" isn't really meaningful in our context - pre-commit is just a tool that runs as part of CI - some things get done as pre-commit hooks because they're fast and it's a convenient place to put them. Devs are encouraged to also run pre-commit locally, but there's no enforcement of this.> Do you run tests? How do you know _which_ tests to run, and not just run every test CI would run, which could be slow?We have performance metrics for pre-commit hooks and pre-push hooks.

      "abstract": "本次HackerNews讨论围绕GitHub近期出现的多次部分服务中断与性能下降事件展开。核心争议点在于服务故障的原因与影响范围。有用户指出，问题源于Azure平台因存储账户ACL变更导致虚拟机扩展操作失效，进而影响了GitHub Actions及自托管运行器；也有用户批评GitHub将责任归咎于“上游供应商”（实为同属微软的Azure），认为这暴露了强制迁移至Azure带来的运维矛盾。讨论中提到，故障不仅导致服务不可用，还造成任务卡顿、计算资源持续消耗等实际损失，部分用户还反映代码下载速度显著下降。\n\n社区观点呈现分歧：一方认为集中化托管平台存在单点故障风险，建议迁移至其他代码托管平台或自建仓库以应对中断；另一方则通过历史对比指出，当前问题虽严重，但相比早期分散式源码管理的混乱仍有进步。共识在于，用户普遍对GitHub稳定性表示担忧，尤其质疑其过度依赖AI运维的可靠性（如用AI处理故障的讽刺性评论）。整体上，讨论揭示了开发者对大型云平台依赖度加深的忧虑，以及对服务透明度和故障响应机制的不满。",

We noticed when github actions went down, then our self hosted runners because we can't scale anymore.InformationActive - Virtual Machines and dependent services - Service management issues in multiple regionsImpact statement: As early as 19:46 UTC on 2 February 2026, we are aware of an ongoing issue causing customers to receive error notifications when performing service management operations - such as create, delete, update, scaling, start, stop - for Virtual Machines (VMs) across multiple regions. These issues are also causing impact to services with dependencies on these service management operations - including Azure Arc Enabled Servers, Azure Batch, Azure DevOps, Azure Load Testing, and GitHub. For details on the latter, please see https://www.githubstatus.com.Current status: We have determined that these issues were caused by a recent configuration change that affected public access to certain Microsoft‑managed storage accounts, used to host extension packages. We are actively working on mitigation, including updating configuration to restore relevant access permissions. We have applied this update in one region so far, and are assessing the extent to which this mitigates customer issues. Our next update will be provided by 22:30 UTC, approximately 60 minutes from now.https://azure.status.microsoft/en-us/status",

The same prompt, same context, same model can produce wildly different quality outputs on complex tasks. I've seen this most acutely when asking models to maintain consistency across multi-file changes.The paper's finding that \"larger models + harder problems = more variance\" explains something I couldn't quite articulate before: why Sonnet sometimes outperforms Opus on specific workflows. The \"smarter\" model attempts more sophisticated solutions, but the solution space it's exploring has more local minima where it can get stuck.One practical takeaway: decomposing complex tasks into smaller, well-specified subtasks doesn't just help with context limits - it fundamentally changes the bias/variance profile of each inference call. You're trading one high-variance call for multiple lower-variance calls, which tends to be more predictable even if it requires more orchestration overhead.",

I become visibly amused when I read many of the system prompts out there. Anthropomorphism is the biggest anti pattern with these models.

It's probably not critical in most cases, but it's safer to pretend like it is. Recursive/iterative decomposition of the problem is the only thing I've seen so far that can scale arbitrarily. For example, if you invoke a sub agent every time you read a file, you can reduce the impact to the token budget of the caller by orders of magnitude.

Meanwhile, deliberately increasing reasoning budgets through API settings provides only modest coherence improvements. The natural variation dominates.<<Language models are probabilistic and not deterministic. Therefore incoherence _by definition_ increases as a response becomes lengthier. This is not true for humans, who tend to act/communicate deterministically. If I ask the human, to read a pdf and ask, is there a word of \"paperclip\" in the pdf? The human deterministically will provide a yes/no answer and no matter how many times we repeat the process, they will provide the same answer consistently (not due to autocorrelation, because this can be done across different humans). LMs will have a probabilistic response - dependent on the training itself: with a very well trained model we can get a 99% probabilistic outcome, which means out of 100 simulations, it will give you 1 time the wrong answer. We have no clue about the \"probablistic\" component for LMs, however, simulations could be done to research this. Also, I would be very curious about autocorrelation in models. If a human did a task and came to a conclusion \"yes\", then he will always respond with increasing amount of eyerolling to the same task: \"yes\".Also, imagine the question: \"is the sky blue?\" answer1: \"Yes.\" This has 0 incoherence. answer2: \"Yes, but sometimes it looks like black, sometimes blue.\" While this answer seemingly has 0 incoherence, the probability of increased incoherence is larger than 0 given that answer generation itself is probabilistic. Answer generation by humans is not probabilistic.Therefore, probability driven LMs (all LMs today are probability driven) will always exhibit higher incoherence than humans.I wonder if anybody would disagree with the above.",

Since training has the effect of compressing knowledge into subspaces, a necessary corollary of that fact is that there are now regions within the vector space that contain nothing very much. Those are the valleys that need to be tunneled through, ie the model needs to activate disparate regions of its knowledge manifold simultaneously, which, seems like it might be difficult to do.

However, they might also want to just leave it at 1 rem and let the folks that prefer higher information density to customize their own browser settings, since those are what most well developed sites should respect and it might be more accessible by default on most devices (for my eyes, at the very least).As for targeting specific screen sizes for non-standard font scaling, media queries also would help!In regards to missing information dense pages, try changing your browser font settings, it might actually be quite pleasant for you to see many sites respecting that preference!",

Attackers get code execution on machines that specifically trust the update channel.What's concerning is the 6-month window. Supply chain attacks are difficult to detect because the malicious code runs with full user permissions from a \"trusted\" source. Most endpoint protection isn't designed to flag software from a legitimate publisher's update infrastructure.For organizations, this argues for staged rollouts and network monitoring for unexpected outbound connections from common applications. For individuals, package managers with cryptographic verification at least add another barrier - though obviously not bulletproof either.",
