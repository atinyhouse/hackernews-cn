      "abstract": "该讨论围绕美国新版膳食指南的核心建议“吃天然食物”展开。社区普遍认同减少加工食品、增加天然食物摄入的总体方向，并肯定新版指南相比过去受行业游说影响的膳食金字塔有所进步。\n\n争议主要集中在如何定义“加工食品”。有用户指出，“超加工食品”这一概念缺乏明确标准，例如全麦面包或婴儿配方奶粉也可能被归为此类，而巴氏杀菌、速冻等技术实际上有益健康。同时，不少人质疑标签的可靠性，认为“草饲”“散养”等营销术语容易被农业企业利用，仅通过调整饲养末期环节就轻松达标。\n\n讨论中还涉及社会与经济层面的分歧。一方认为，加工食品的流行主因是其价格远低于新鲜食材，而非消费者选择；另一方则从文化角度提出，建议中“少成分”的理念可能无意中忽视了亚洲、拉丁美洲等地使用多种香料烹饪的健康饮食传统。此外，有用户担忧当前政府削减相关监管机构预算，可能影响指南的实际执行与食品安全。",

          "content": "> grass fed, free range... Because agribusiness doesn't make money with those.Agribusiness absolutely makes money off of those. In fact they had a hilariously easy time adapting to the consumer trend because all they had to do to label a cow “free range” or “grass fed” was change the finishing stage to a lower density configuration instead of those abominable feed lots you see along highways. The first two stages, rearing and pasturing, didn’t change because they were already “free range” and “grass fed”. Half of the farmland in the US is pastureland and leaving animals in the field to eat grass was always the cheapest way to rear and grow them. They only really get fed corn and other food at the end to fatten them up for human consumption.The dirty not-so-secret is that free range/grass fed cows eat almost the exact same diet as regular cows, they just eat a little more grass  because they’re in the field more during finishing. They’re still walking up to troughs of feed, because otherwise the beef would be unpalatable and grow quite slower.True grass fed beef is generally called “grass finished” beef and it’s unregulated so you won’t find it at a supermarket. They taste gamier and usually have a metallic tang that I quite honestly doubt would ever be very popular. The marbling is also noticeably different and less consistent. Grain finished beef became popular in the 1800s and consumers in the West have strongly preferred it since.I’m not sure you can even find a cow in the entire world that isn’t “grass fed”. Calves need the grass for their gut microbiomes to develop properly.",

Seems partisan spite cuts both ways.I'm glad to see this announcement and despite the leadership in Washington right now I don't think these adjustment will be seen as too controversial by the American public. The recommendations are based on a lot of good nutritional science that's been out there for years, but the buck seems to stop at the conversation around fat.They went to great lengths to remove the debate around good fat vs bad fat from this discussion. Even reading the report, emphasis is put on the discussion of why we use so many pressed oils in the food chain, but not why we phased lard and shortening out of the American diet.\"Eat real butter\" is ostensibly a recommendation presented at the bottom of the webpage, but butter is not a healthy fat. Same with some people's obsession with frying in beef tallow, but the report doesn't want to dig into this distinction for obvious self interested reasons. They even recommend:> When cooking with or adding fats to meals, prioritize oils with essential fatty\nacids, such as olive oil. Other options can include butter or beef tallow.Which is a good recommendation. But no, you don't want to replace olive oil with butter or beef tallow. There's a lot of good nutrition science to back this up, but the report would prefer to not go there. Maybe \"eat some butter\" is appropriate, but unless the FDA wants to have an honest conversation around HDL and LDL cholesterol and saturated fats, I don't see this inverted pyramid doing too much good for overall population health (besides raising awareness)",

For reference, a typical 3-room apartment in Oslo, the capital, is around $400-500k.However, if it's not your primary residence, then you pay tax on 100% of the \"market rate\". The tax rate is 1%, so not insignificant.Until a few years ago, tax on non-primary residences was much lower, and hence we had a lot more people buying to rent if they inherited money or similar. Some even had a dozen or more properties. These have now exited, so policy is working as intended.One thing of course politicians for some reason didn't think of is that if most of the landlords suddenly sell, rental market will shrink.

In the mid-2010s the then Labor party proposed scrapping it and lost the election. It really is the third rail of Australian politics. This is a shame because it needs to be scrapped.It allows you to deduct losses on property against your ordinary income. So if you have a mortgage payment of $3000/month but only earn $2000/month in rent then your income is reduced by $1000/month. That's waht drives a lot of small investors to essentially speculate on property.The US actually has a better system than this, which is that if you earn over a certain income level, you cannot deduct passive losses (like the above situation) against ordinary income. That would be better but still not enough.So many upper income Australians essentially end up just hoarding property. They'll call it \"investment properties\" but really it's speculation. Historically, property was treated as an income producing asset, not a speculative capitals gains asset.Oh and capital gains on non-primary residences should be like 70%. If you want to stop rampant speculation, that's how you do it.> Tangent: how should we approach changing the housing mix in a city like Perth where 95% of new homes are large four-bedroom detached houses?Perth like every Australian city is an urban planning disaster. It's just endless sprawl up and down the coast and inland to the hills. A generation or two ago it was a quarter acre block. Those days are long gone unless you're wealthy or you're 50km+ from the city (less if you go east).So it's a car-dependent soulless hellhole. I say this as someone who knows Perth well. So even now if you build higher-density housing along transit routes, as they're doing, you still need a car (or 4) to go anywhere but work. And high land values make infrastructure projects incredibly expensive. Like imagine trying to build the Perth to Mandurah train line now instead of 30+ years ago when it was actually built. I guess they could utilize the Freeway they already had but what about the fremantle or Midland lines?What you should do as you build out is reserve space for future infrastructure. AFAIK no Australian city, especially Perth, has never done. So Guildford Road or Great Eastern Highway should really be a freeway. Same with Albany Highway.In 2024 Western Australia did really relax ADU (granny flat) development rules. The rules used to be really strict. Now you can basically always build one with normal building approval if you meet the minimum lot size requirements (generally 450sqm, sometimes as low as 350sqm, depending on the council).Single family home zoning is really cancer to any decently sized city.Anyway, the truth is, I'm not sure it can be fixed now. Big infrastructure projects are prohibitively expensive even with tools like eminent domain. We need to look at why it's so expensive to build apartments.I think the only thing you can do now is for the government to become a significant suplier of housing to increase supply and stabilize rents.",

He'd repeat this until he had something to copy and paste to us to \"prove\" that he was on the right track.As a broader anecdote, I'm seeing \"I thought I had ADHD and ChatGPT agrees!\" at an alarming rate in a couple communities I'm in with a lot of younger people. This combined with the TikTok trend of diagnosing everything as a symptom of ADHD is becoming really alarming. In some cohorts, it's a rarity for someone to believe they don't have ADHD.

I can sit down with an LLM for as long as I need and discuss my concerns and any potential suggestions, have it summarize them in a structure that's useful for my doctor, and send an email ahead of the appointment. For small things, she doesn't even need me to come in anymore and a simple phone call to confirm is enough.

They deal with a lot of hypochondriacs — people who imagine they have all sorts of issues and then try to MacGyver themselves to better health. You can’t read an HN thread on health care issues without dozens of those coming out of the woodwork to share their magical, special way of beating the system. Silicon Valley has a long history of people that did all sorts of weird crap. There's a great anecdote about Steve Jobs turning orange when he was restricting himself to a diet of carrots because he believed god knows what. In the end he died young of pancreatic cancer. Probably not connected but smart person that did some wacky stuff that probably wasn't that good for him.I'm on statins that have side effects that I'm experiencing. That's a common thing. ChatGPT was useful for me to figure out some of that. I've had other minor issues where even just trying to understand what the medication I'm being prescribed is supposed to do can be helpful. Doctors aren't great at explaining their decisions. \"Just take pill x, you'll be fine\".Doctors have to diagnose patients in a way that isn't that different from how I would diagnose a technical issue. Except they are starved for information and have to get all their information out of a 10-15 minute consult with a patient that is only talking about vague symptoms. It's easy to see how that goes wrong sometimes or how they would miss critical things. And they get to deal with all the hypochondriacs as well. So they have to poke through that as well and can't assume the patient is actually being truthful/honest.LLMs are useful tools if you know how to use them. But they can also lead to a lot of confirmation bias. The best doctors tell you what you need to hear, not what you want to hear. So, tools like this are great and now a reality that doctors need to deal with whether they like it or not.Some of the Covid crisis intersected with early ChatGPT usage. It wasn't pretty. People bought into a lot of nonsense that they came up with while doom scrolling Reddit, or using early versions of LLMs. But things have improved since then. LLMs are better and less likely to go completely off the rails.I try to look at this a bit rationally: I know I don't get the best care possible all the time because doctors have to limit time they spend on me and I'm publicly insured in Germany so subject to cost savings. I can help myself to some extent by doing my homework. But in the end, I have to trust my doctor to confirm things. My mode is that I use ChatGPT to understand what's going on and then try to give my doctor a complete picture so he has all the information needed to help me.",

          "content": "Before I moved to where I live now, I had a doctor's office open in my neighborhood I could walk to. At first I thought it was amazing and I started going there. It was a really fancy place, state of art, loads of diagnostic equipment and a limited on-site lab, almost a hospital. But pretty soon I realized I was almost always seeing Nurse Practitioners, or Doctors so fresh out of medical school they were still wet behind the ears.Even worse, they were almost always wrong about the diagnosis and I'd find myself on 3 or 4 rounds of antibiotics, or would go to the pharmacy to pick up something and they'd let me know the cocktail I had just been prescribed had dangerous counterindications. I finally stopped going when I caught a doctor searching webmd when I was on my fourth return visit for a simple sinus infection that had turned into a terrible ear infection.My next doctor wasn't much better. And I had really started to lose trust in the medical system and in medical training.We moved a few years ago to a different city, and I hadn't found a doctor yet. One day I took sick with something, went to a local walk-in clinic in a strip mall used mostly by the local underprivileged immigrant community.Luck would have it I now found an amazing doctor who's been 100% correct in every diagnosis and line of care for both me and my wife since - including some difficult and sometimes hard to diagnose issues. She has basically no equipment except a scale, a light, a sphygmomanometer, and a stethoscope. Does all of her work using old fashioned techniques like listening to breathing or palpation and will refer to the local imaging center or send out to the local lab nearby if something deeper is needed.The difference in absolutely wild. I sometimes wonder if she and my old doctors are even in the same profession.I guess what I'm trying to say is, if you don't like your doctor, try some other ones until you find a good one, because they can be a world difference in quality -- and don't be moved by the shine of the office.",

Some of the court documents against infowars placed the price for that sort of airtime at something like $20,000.The problem comes in that the actual experts have very little want or desire to do the same.  We're lucky if we see a few \"science communicators\" that step up to the plate, but they very rarely end up with the funds to sell the truth.This a big part of how the \"vaccines cause autism\" garbage spread.  Long before it  caught on like it did, Wakefield was going around to conferences and selling his books and doing public speaking events on the dangers.That pattern is pretty apparent if you look at major fad diets over the years.

And the instructions are unrealistic to anyone using coding assistants.Maybe it's true that for some very bad prompts, old version did a better job by not following the prompt, and that this is reduced utility for some people.Unrelated to assistants or coding, as an API user I've certainly had model upgrades that feel like downgrades at first, until I work out that the new model is following my instructions better. Sometimes my instructions were bad, sometimes they were attempts to get the older model to do what I want by saying over-the-top stuff that the new model now follows more precisely to a worse result. So I can definitely imagine that new models can be worse until you adapt.Actually, another strange example like this - I had gotten in the habit of typing extremely fast to LLMs because they work just fine with my prompts riddled with typos. I basically disconnected the part of my brain that cares about sequencing between hands, so words like \"can\" would be either \"can\" or \"cna\". This ended up causing problems with newer models which would take my typos seriously. For example, if I ask to add support for commandline flag \"allwo-netwokr-requests\" it will usually do what I said, while previous versions would do what I wanted.For anyone with some technical expertise and who is putting in serious effort to using AI coding assistants, they are clearly getting better at a rapid pace. Not worse.",

The documentation is available here: SoundTouch API Documentation (https://assets.bosecreative.com/m/496577402d128874/original/...).AFAIK, the soundtouch web API was already accessible via some bose developer portal. It doesn't seem like they are open sourcing anything. This API just allows you to make basic requests to do things like change volume on the speaker.To support the smart features of the SoundTouch speakers, we would the soundtouch user management service. Speakers connect to this very frequently and its where refresh tokens for music services and presets are stored. The speaker firmware itself has lots of source code, including the bit to handle music services and playback. There is an abstraction layer for music service APIs. There is a process on the speaker that reaches out to a music service registry, which is an index of bose music service adapters. Each of these adapters essentially proxies a music service like tunein, spotify, and even the \"stream a custom station\" feature.If bose open-sourced the speaker firmware, we could make a firmware build which talks to a 3rd party user management service, and reaches out to a 3rd party music service registry. Then we could add and maintain music service playback for the community. But there is no open sourcing of any actual code here and this soundtouch web api cannot change the URLs on the existing firmware of the user management service or the music service registry.So to my eye this story seems misleading and just some PR nonsense. It's a little frustrating reading all of the \"great job, Bose!\" comments here like anything was actually done... Disclaimer: I used to work at Bose.",

Obviously nobody wanted that feature, but it was hella cool that it worked. Oh, and you could make Skype calls from across the room, and the microphone array lived up to Skype's tough certification requirements which took weeks of testing in Microsoft's anechoic chamber for the DSP/algorithm team to fine tune.I tried to push for open-sourcing the platform but it was tricky because 1) the director of engineering in Harman didn't know what open source meant and for a hardware focused business to understand the value was a hard sell, 2) it used a HW module that came with a SW stack I mostly got rid off but a few parts were remaining that would need to be replaced which would require additional resources, 3) I was burned out at that point and had limited energy left to fight the good fight.

I'm seeing calls to virtually press buttons on the speaker, set the input source, to query the presets, and some zone-relayed calls, but nothing about actually playing audio from network sources.For the call re: presets I see:> Description: Presets are a core part of the SoundTouch ecosystem. A preset is used to set and recall a specific music stream supported by the SoundTouch speakerThere's a GET method that returns information about presets. Presumably you'd use a POST or PUT method to manage the presents. To that end, under POST, it says:> POST: N/AIt looks like this API basically allows you to control it like an dumb speaker. That's not nothing, but it's not much either.There doesn't seem to be anything in the API about controlling how the speak communicates with a back end service.Edit:Having some time to read over your [2] and the link to [0] it looks like getting root on the speaker w/ physical access is ridiculously easy. Booting the unit w/ a FAT32 USB drive attached with a file named \"remote_services\" in an otherwise empty root directory opens up an ssh server and the root user has no password.The comments on [0] have some interesting tidbits in them, too.These speakers look like they might be fun to play with and once Bose kills the back end people may unload them cheap.[0] https://flarn2006.blogspot.com/2014/09/hacking-bose-soundtou...",

But it is not that, and they didn't open source their app either.What they did is that they removed dependence on their servers, and opened their device to be controlled by third party apps. That is, they let users use their device past its end of life, including when the first party app will stop being maintained, but not to the point of letting user add features.In understand why they would do that, they don't want users to backport features only available on their latest models that are sold at a premium, therefore competing against themselves.

So they block it entirely.This is the reason why they aren't blacking out IPv4From my own experience, my ex gf was iranian. She was using discord via some psiphon vpn or something iirc idk how she got access to it but she had it.I didn't trust psiphon that much so I asked her to install proton vpn and it did work. I wanted to play minecraft with her so prismlauncher but resources couldn't be downloaded so I made her download protonvpn so that she can play minecraft with me/install it (piracy was forced and also at that point necessary)She was using tlauncher which somehow worked but tlauncher was russian spyware and prism launcher was open sourceI talked to her about how she could use stablecoins crypto but crypto was illegal so ended up not suggesting it in the end to prevent inflation or talked to her about gold which is wild considering its like 3-4 months after we broke up but inflation is at 50% now.Anyways the point being that protonvpn worked and other vpn worked too.My question is, would things like protonvpn work after this blackout? I mean marco's and other comments in a thread explain to me that ipv4 can be blocked by them so I presume vpn's for ipv4 would shut down. And so vpns would most likely be using ipv6 which got blocked downSo does that mean that now Iranian people can't access vpns?I also saw the other day some video about how when people called Iranian numbers from outside countries some random AI  robot ass voice called and asked who are you and who are you talking to? And gave pause, and the most logical explaination to it was that the govt was recording these things so dont say anything to them. It was a creepypasta video.Briar might help but Briar still leaks some metadata when I talked to their authors or heard about it online.Instagram isn't blocked in Iran so are these social media apps still there after the blackout?This raises so many questions and wtf is happening in the world",

Iran's internet is diverse at the edge, and bottlenecked at the international gateway.Censorship, throttling, and (presumably) surveillance occurs at both layers. In some cases, also the region matters (Sistan and Baluchistan for example have experienced extended blackouts). In part that heterogeneity is because they still ideally want to keep businesses or VIPs online to mitigate the economic loss or logistical issues.Consequently, the actual means of blocking tends to be on an ISP basis: some will simply drop packets, some will have left certain endpoints open, some will leave international DNS open, etc etc. All that changes when activists notice, exploit the opening, and then the ISP finds out. And then sometimes the TIC (the gateway) will impose blanket limitations or throttling.My impression is that Iranian intelligence cares less about means than effectiveness, and ISP operators want to keep their license, livelihoods and lives, so they figure out how to meet the mandate. Given that this is something like the fourth blackout in recent years, they've gotten enough practice that there's few options out (that aren't Starlink).",

Our waiter was complaining to my guide that he couldn’t contact his mother in a western province. I saw other people in the crowded restaurant fiddling with their phones and looking annoyed. I asked my guide what he thought was going on. He shrugged.\"\"Without internet and phones, people can’t talk to loved ones, businesses can’t function, trade can’t function, and even government offices can’t function. Only the Taliban with their well-established network of short-wave radios can function.

It was an extraction/capture operation. It was a large scale one, but they left after they captured Maduro and his Wife.> I think you can argue that the Bin Laden raid was and invasion into Pakistan.

I think having it pervade products in a much more subtle way is the future though.For example, if you close a youtube browser tab with a comment half written it will pop up an `alert(\"You will lose your comment if you close this window\")`. It does this if the comment is a 2 page essay or \"asdfasdf\". Ideally the alert would only happen if the comment seemed important but it would readily discard short or nonsensical input. That is really difficult to do in traditional software but is something an LLM could do with low effort. The end result is I only have to deal with that annoying popup when I really am glad it is there.That is a trivial example but you can imagine how a locally run LLM that was just part of the SDK/API developers could leverage would lead to better UI/UX. For now everyone is making the LLM the product, but once we start building products with an LLM as a background tool it will be great.It is actually a really weird time, my whole career we wanted to obfuscate implementation and present a clean UI to end users, we want them peaking behind the curtain as little as possible.

You can find examples of CEOs talking about buying up hardware for AI without having a datacenter to run it in.  This run on hardware will ultimately drive hardware prices up everywhere.The knock on effect is that hardware manufacturers are likely going to spend less money doing R&D for consumer level hardware.  Why make a CPU for a laptop when you can spend the same research dollars making a 700 core beast for AI workloads in a datacenter?  And you can get a nice premium for that product because every AI company is fighting to get any hardware right now.",

One, as the author argues, is to write a library in an existing language, which may require sacrificing ergonomics to fit inside the syntax of the host language, but is safe, modular and reusable.Many DSLs can be bolted onto an existing language with support for compiler extensions. This approach offers more flexibility, but often leads to fragmentation and poor interoperability in the language ecosystem.There is third approach, established by a group in Minnesota [1], which is to design languages and tools which are modular and extensible from the get-go, so that extensions are more interoperable. They do research on how to make this work using attribute grammars.If the host language has a sufficiently expressive type system, you can often get away with writing a fluent API [2] or type safe embedded DSL. But designing languages and type systems with good support for meta-programming is also an active area of research. [3, 4]If none of these options work, the last resort is to start from tabula rasa and write your own parser, compiler, and developer tools. This offers the most flexibility, but requires an enormous amount of engineering, and generally is not recommended in 2026.[1]: https://melt.cs.umn.edu[2]: https://arxiv.org/pdf/2211.01473[3]: https://www.cs.tsukuba.ac.jp/~kam/papers/aplas2016.pdf[4]: https://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.17065",

Some would even argue that some kinds of \"libraries\" could be viewed as languages themselves, as much as some languages might as well have been written as libraries in another language.Also often, the language doesn't live isolated from its implementation (compiler or interpreter). While theory looks at languages via its semantics, in practice as the OP notes it is about the quality of the implementation and what can be reasonably done with the language.A recent [1] case is Julia. I think it has hit a kind of sweet spot for language design where new performant code tends to get written in Julia rather than in some other language and bound to it. At its core, it is a simple \"call functions, passing data in and getting results out\" kind of language, but what the functions (\"methods\") mean and how the compiler does just-ahead-of-time compilation with deep type specialized code means you can write high level code that optimizes very well. Those mechanics operate under the hood though, which makes for a pleasant programming experience ... and there are loads of cutting edge packages being written in Julia. It is less interesting to look at Julia as \"just the language\".[1] recent in programming languages is perhaps anything <= 15 years? .. because it takes time to discover a language's potential.",

It's also risky to adopt a language that you cannot easily hire developers for, for example.Libraries are great, but there is only so much they can address, and that depends on the language, too, as the article correctly points out. And there are two kinds of libries: tool libraries and frameworks. Someone once said it nicely: \"Frameworks are like Hollywood - 'You don't call us, we call you!'\".

One type of language I’ve always thought about that could be made more approachable to non technical users is an outline-liked language with English like syntaxes and being a DSL, the shape of the outline would be very much fixed and on a guardrail, and can’t express arbitrary instructions like normal programming languages, but an escape hatch (to more expressive language) for advanced users can be provided.

In fact, the actual depth-first search isn't even part of the standard.The nice thing about prolog is that you write logical rules, and they can get used in whatever order and direction that is needed. By direction, I mean that if you define \"a grandparent is the parent of a parent\", you can now use that rule not just to evaluate whether one person is a parent (or to find all grandparents) but also to conclude that if you know someone is a grandparent, and they are the parent of some one, then that person is someone's parent. Ok, it can also do recursion, so if you define an ancestor as a parent or the parent of an ancestor it will recurse all the way up the family tree. Neat.You could write some kind of runtime that takes c code and brute-forces its way from outputs to inputs, except that regular imperative code allows for all kinds of things that make this impossible (e.g. side-effects). So then, you'd be limited to some subset, essentially ending up with a domain specific language again, albeit with the same syntax as your regular code, rather than those silly :- symbols (although LISP looks much sillier than prolog IMHO).What the article is getting at is that if you use some features specific to a language, it's hard to embed your code as a library in another language.

What's special in Prolog compared to imperative languages including functional languages is that variables aren't \"assigned\" but implicitly range over potential values until satisfying the context, like in math formulas for sets. Yes you can express that awkwardly with tons of type annotations and DSL conventions so that you never have to leave your favourite programming language. But then there's the problem of a Prolog \"engine\" doing quite a bit more than what could be reasonably assumed behind a synchronous library call, such as working with a compact solution space representation and/or value factoring, parallel execution environment, automatic value pruning and propagation, etc.The integration of a Prolog backend into a mainstream stack is typically achieved via Prolog code generation (and also code generation via LLMs) or as a \"service\" on the Prolog side, considering Prolog also has excellent support for parsing DSLs or request/responses of any type; as in, you can implement a JSON parser in a single line of code actually.As they say, if Prolog fits your application, it fits really well, like with planning, constraint solving, theorem proving, verification/combinatoric test case enumeration, pricing models, legal/strategic case differentiation, complex configuration and the like, the latter merely leveraging the modularity of logic clauses in composing complex programs using independent units.So I don't know how much you've worked hands on with Prolog, but I think you actually managed to pick about one of the worst rather than best examples ;)",

There's Java, the language that keeps improving, and then the Spring ecosystem, which is what 95% of programmers end up having to use professionally, with its heavy \"magic\" component. Writing services avoiding Spring is going against the grain.

Also worth learning about Dual EC DRBG debacle.Secondly am immediate friend of mine worked at a FANG company that routinely sent a firehose of all sorts of things matching all sorts of filters directly to governments. In fact many ISPS have back-doors built in and that's not really disputed (wikipedia: room641A).So the question to ask yourself is -- if this was a deliberate interaction that cloudfare was required to participate in via a warrant, would they legally even be allowed to publish a blog post that contradicted this?So I think that is probably the default attitude of skepticism you are seeing, which in my opinion is a good default.

So the web, tentatively, looks pretty safe.Email jumps out as vulnerable to eavesdropping, as we largely use opportunistic encryption when transferring messages between mail servers and an on-network-path attacker can use STARTTLS stripping or similar techniques. Most mail servers happily send using cleartext or without validating the TLS certificate.  Check that you and your counter-parties are using DNSSEC+DANE, or MTA-STS to ensure that authenticated encryption is always used. Adoption is still quite low, but it's a great time to get started. Watch out for transactional email, like password reset messages, which virtually never validate encryption in transit (https://alexsci.com/blog/is-email-confidential-in-transit-ye... ; instead use multi-factor encryption).TLS certificates themselves are at risk, unfortunately. An attacker who controls the network in-and-out of your DNS servers can issue domain-verified certificates for your domain; even removing protections like CAA records. DNSSEC is the classic solution here, although using a geographically distributed DNS provider should also work (see multi-perspective validation). Certificate transparency log monitoring should detect any attacker-issued certificates (a review of certificates issued for .ve domains would be interesting).Ideally, we should build an internet where we don't need to trust the network layer. A BGP route leak would be a performance/availability concern only. We're not there yet, but now is a great time to take the next step in that direction.",

It therefore stands to reason that there exists a \"102\" or \"103\" course that expands upon it, as well as material going far beyond \"the syllabus\".The NSA and thirteen eyes generally have detailed traffic logging capability at core internet exchanges around the world. It is reasonable to think that a good way of exfiltrating data would be by having something like an ICMP or maybe even  TTL based covert channel, such that there is no chance that the sent data is ever received by the recipient.

I don't think the situation is so dire.Cloudflare's post boils down to Hanlon's razor: a plausible benign interpretation of the facts is available, so we should give some scrutiny to accusations of malice.Are there specific relevant facts being omitted in the article, or other factors that diminish Cloudflare's credibility? They're clearly a qualified expert in this space.Let's assume for the sake of argument that the BGP leaks (all of them from the month of December, in fact) were the result of secret US military intelligence operations. The fact that militaries generally use cyber vulnerabilities to achieve their objectives is not news, and the US military is no exception. Keeping specific exploits secret preserves a valuable advantage over competitor states.One could argue that Cloudflare's post helps to preserve USG's secrecy. We can't know publicly whether USG solicited the article. But even if we assume so (again assuming malice): Is Cloudflare wrong to oblige? I don't think so, but reasonable people could disagree.Merely pointing out Hanlon's razor doesn't fundamentally change the facts of the situation. In Cloudflare's expert opinion, the facts don't necessarily implicate USG in the BGP leaks without an assumption of malice. Assuming Cloudflare is malicious without justification is just deeper belief in the conspiracy that they're arguing against.If Cloudflare is distorting the facts, we should believe (rightly) that they're malicious.

          "content": "My perspective on this is that maybe Tailwind Labs shouldn't have been a for-profit business, or at least not one of the size that it grew to be.I was reading a writeup on this history of Tailwind[1] made by Adam Wathan (who created Tailwind).It seems like he was working on a variety of different business ideas including \"Reddit meets Pinterest meets Twitter\" and \"a developer-focused, webhook-driven checkout platform\".  He created the basis of Tailwind just to help him build these projects, but it kept getting attention when he would post about his progress building them online.Here's an important quote from the doc:\"Now at this point I had zero intention of maintaining any sort of open-source CSS framework. It didn’t even occur to me that what I had been building would even be interesting to anyone. But stream after stream, people were always asking about the CSS\"It seems like Adam's main goal was to start a software business, and Tailwind just happened to get popular and became what he pivoted his efforts into.  There's obviously nothing wrong with wanting to start a business, but trying to take an open-source CSS framework and turn it into a multi-million dollar business feels unnatural and very difficult to maintain long-term.To his credit, he did pull it off.  He built a seemingly quite successful business and hired a sizable team, and apparently made a decent amount of revenue along the way.But now, for AI reasons or otherwise, that business is struggling and failing to sustain the scale it was before.  To me, it seems like the business is more or less completely separate from the open-source Tailwind project itself.  It's, as far as I can understand, a business that sells templates and components built with Tailwind, and it uses Tailwind's popularity to bootstrap customers and sales.If it were me who ended up building Tailwind, there's no way I would have pursued turning it into a big business.  Maybe I would have tried some kind of consulting style, where I'd offer my time to companies evaluating or integrating Tailwind.Now that Tailwind is getting hundreds of thousands (millions?) of dollars a year in sponsorships, it feels weird to have this for-profit business on the side at the same time.Maybe it's just my own sensibilities and worldview, but I feel like Tailwind should just be what it is: an extremely popular and successful open-source CSS framework.[1] https://adamwathan.me/tailwindcss-from-side-project-byproduc...",

Since then, there's been continual improvements up until last month with 4.1.18, totalling 8 years of dev work. A simple CSS library wouldn't have much need to go past 0.1.0, certainly not 1.0.0. Clearly tailwind did, which would imply there's more than meets the eye.But you can't have it both ways, it can't be just a simple CSS library that doesn't need that much money, but also expect a decade of work+ on it.

You can sponsor Tailwind for as little as $6,000/year. 29 companies were already sponsoring Tailwind including 16 companies at the $60,000/year level. Maybe Google AI Studio has decided to shell out a lot more, but it could also be a relatively small sponsorship compared to the $1.1M in sponsorships that Tailwind is already getting. Google has deep pockets and could easily just say \"f-it, we're betting on AI coding and this tool helps us make UIs and $2M/year is nothing compared to what we're spending on AI.\" It's also possible that the AI Studio team has a small discretionary budget and is giving Tailwind $6,000/year.It's good, but it's important to read this as \"they're offering some money\" and not \"Tailwind CSS now doesn't have financial issues because they have a major sponsor.\" This could just be a 1-5% change in Tailwind's budget. We don't know.And that's not to take away from their sponsorship, but on the heels of the discussion yesterday it's important to note that Tailwind was already being sponsored by many companies and still struggling.

But all that is not needed to maintain a CSS library (that is kind of feature complete already).I think Tailwind was making a lot of money (surely over a million), expanded and got bloated unnecessarily just because they had all that money, and now that their income dropped to what still is a lot of money for a CSS library, they're angry that they have to cut expenses to a more reasonable level.I guess it worked out for them because now they have even more sponsoring.And they used the AI bad get out of jail free card when a lot of their drop in sales probably comes from shadcn/ui and others which offer something similar for free.[1] https://petersuhm.com/posts/2025/",

      "abstract": "该讨论围绕Linux内核漏洞平均潜伏2年甚至更长的现象展开。核心争议点在于如何解读这一数据及其反映的问题本质。有人认为这体现了内核代码库的复杂性，逻辑错误和硬件假设问题难以避免，并指出Rust语言虽能提升内存安全，但对这类并发状态机漏洞作用有限。也有用户指出研究样本存在局限——仅基于28%的修复提交进行推断可能影响结论准确性。讨论中提到，漏洞长期潜伏可能源于测试覆盖不足，类似竞态条件在应用代码中也存在多年才被触发的情况。部分用户将矛头指向商业安全团队（如grsecurity）未公开漏洞修复成果，导致同类漏洞反复出现。对于漏洞潜伏时长是否反映维护者效率，观点存在分歧：一方认为“修复速度在提升”是积极信号，另一方则强调老旧内核版本广泛使用导致许多修复无法实际落地。共识在于，高度并发的系统漏洞检测具有普遍挑战性，需结合更全面的测试方法和社区协作来应对。",

In a lot of cases, you won't know you have a race condition because in many cases the contention on the lock is low so the race isn't exposed.

It uses the relationship between size and mass.Because A0 is defined as having an area of exactly 1 square meter, the paper density (GSM or grams per square meter) maps directly to the weight of the sheet.>A0 = 1 meter square.>Standard office paper = 80 gsm>Therefore, one sheet of A0 = 80 grams.>Since A4 is 1/16th of an A0, a single sheet of standard A4 paper weighs 5 grams.I rarely need to use a scale for postage. If I have a standard envelope (~5g) and 3 sheets of paper (15g), I know I'm at 20g total. It turns physical shipping logistics into simple integer arithmetic. The elegance of the metric system is that it makes the properties of materials discoverable through their definitions.",

On the one hand, they're simple fractions and not irrational numbers; on the other, they're different, so you can't just double the size of something printed on ANSI A/letter sized to fill ANSI B/tabloid size, the way you can go from A4 to A3.Only a small subset of users will ever want to do that (since if you're printing text you probably need to re-typeset it to keep the type a good size for reading), but only a small subset of users actually care about the aspect ratio or exact dimensions of their paper at all, so whether it is 8.5 or 8.11 or 8.314159... inches doesn't really matter.",

Ex: Plan mode is basically bootstrapping how that TODO list gets seeded and how todos ground themselves when they get reached, and user interactions are how you realign the todo lists. The todolist is subtle but was a big shift in coding tools, and many seem to be surprised when we discuss it -- most seem to focus on whether to use plan mode or not, but todo lists will still be active. I ran a fun experiment last month on how well claude code solves CTFs, and disabling the TodoList tool and planning is 1-2 grade jumps: https://media.ccc.de/v/39c3-breaking-bots-cheating-at-blue-t... .Fwiw, I found it funny how the article stuffs \"smarter context management\" into a breeze-y TODO bullet point at the end for going production-grade. I've been noticing a lot of NIH/DIY types believing they can do a good job of this and then, when forced to have results/evals that don't suck in production, losing the rest of the year on that step. (And even worse when they decide to fine-tune too.)",

That was (as far as I know) the first of these articles making the point that the core of a coding agent is actually quite simple (and all the deep complexity is in the LLM). Reading it was a light-bulb moment for me.FWIW, I agree with other commenters here that you do need quite a bit of additional scaffolding (like TODOs and much more) to make modern agents work well. And Claude Code itself is a fairly complex piece of software with a lot of settings, hooks, plugins, UI features, etc. Although I would add that once you have a minimal coding agent loop in place, you can get it to bootstrap its own code and add those things! That is a fun and slightly weird thing to try.(By the way, the \"January 2025\" date on this article is clearly a typo for 2026, as Claude Code didn't exist a year ago and it includes use of the claude-sonnet-4-20250514 model from May.)Edit: and if you're interested in diving deeper into what Claude Code itself is doing under the hood, a good tool to understand it is \"claude-trace\" (https://github.com/badlogic/lemmy/tree/main/apps/claude-trac...). You can use it to see the whole dance with tool calls and the LLM: every call out to the LLM and the LLM's responses, the LLM's tool call invocations and the responses from the agent to the LLM when tools run, etc. When Claude Skills came out I used this to confirm my guess about how they worked (they're a tool call with all the short skill descriptions stuffed into the tool description base prompt). Reading the base prompt is also interesting. (Among other things, they explicitly tell it not to use emoji, which tracks as when I wrote my own agent it was indeed very emoji-prone.)",

I had a think about why I won't & it struck me that there's a funny dichotomy with AI tools:1. all of the above are things the typical vibe coder stereotypes I've encountered simply do not really care deeply about2. people that care about the above things are less likely to care enough about AI tools to commit their personal time to reporting & debugging these issuesThere's bound to be exceptions to these stereotypes out there but I doubt there's sufficient numbers to make AI tooling good.",

          "content": "Hey! I created Jeff Dean Facts! Not the jokes themselves, but the site that collected them.It was in 2008 I think (give or take a year, can't remember). I worked at Google at the time. Chunk Norris Facts was a popular Internet meme (which I think later faded when he came out as MAGA, but I digress...). A colleague (who wishes to remain anonymous) thought the idea of Jeff Dean Facts would be funny, and April 1st was coming up.At the time, there was a team working on an experimental web app hosting platform code named Prometheus -- it was later released as App Engine. Using an early, internal build I put together a web site where people could submit \"facts\" about Jeff Dean, rate each other's facts on a five-star scale, and see the top-rated facts. Everything was anonymous. I had a few coworkers who are funnier than me populate some initial facts.I found a few bugs in Prometheus in the process, which the team rapidly fixed to meet my \"launch date\" of April 1st. :)On the day, which I think was a Sunday, early in the morning, I sent an email to the company-wide \"misc\" mailing list (or maybe it was eng-misc?) from a fake email address (a google group alias with private membership), and got the mailing list moderator to approve it.It only took Jeff an hour or two to hack his way through the back-end servers (using various internal-facing status pages, Borg logs, etc.) to figure out my identity.But everyone enjoyed it!My only regret is that I targeted the site specifically at Jeff and not Sanjay Ghemawat. Back then, Jeff & Sanjay did everything together, and were responsible for inventing a huge number of core technologies at Google (I have no idea to what extent they still work together today). The site was a joke, but I think it had the side effect of elevating Jeff above Sanjay, which is not what I intended. Really the only reason I targeted Jeff is because he's a bit easier to make fun of personality-wise, and because \"Jeff Dean Facts\" sort of rolls off the tongue easier that \"Sanjay Ghemawat Facts\" -- but in retrospect this feels a little racist. :(My personal favorite joke is: Jeff Dean puts his pants on one leg at a time, but if he had more than two legs, you'd see his approach is actually O(log n).",

It's not clear whether this fact is really true, or whether this line is simply part of the joke, so I've omitted the usual (TRUE) identifier here. Interpret this as you see fit :)I think this one's true-ish. Back in the day when Google didn't have good cron services for the corp and production domains [1], Jeff Dean's workstation ran a job that made something called (iirc) the \"protocol buffer debug database\". Basically, a big file (probably an sstable) with compiled .proto introspection data for a huge number of checked-in protobufs. You could use it to produce human-readable debug output from what was otherwise a fairly indecipherable blob. I don't think it was ever intended for production use, but some things that shouldn't have ended up using it. I think after Jeff had been on vacation for a while, his `prodaccess` credentials expired, the job stopped working, maybe the output became unavailable, and some things broke.Here's a related story I know is true: when I was running Google Reader, I got paged frequently for Bigtable replication delay, and I eventually traced it to trouble accessing files that shared GFS chunkservers with this database. I mentioned it on some mailing list, and almost immediately afterward Jeff Dean CCed me on a code review changing the file's replication from r=3 to r=12.

I remember when Jeff and Sanjay wrote \"gsearch\", a distributed grep over google3 that ran on 40-80 machines [1].There was a series of talks called \"Nooglers and the PDB\" I think, and I remember Jeff explained gsearch to maybe 20-40 of us in a small conference room in building 43.It was a tiny and elegant piece of code -- something like ~2000 total lines of C++, with \"indexer\" (I think it just catted all the files, which were later mapped into memory), replicated server, client, and Borg config.The auth for the indexer lived in Jeff's home dir, perhaps similar to the protobuf DB.That was some of the first \"real Google C++ distributed system\" code I read, and it was eye opening.---After that talk, I submitted a small CL to that directory (which I think Sanjay balked at slightly, but Jeff accepted).  And then I put a Perforce watch on it to see what other changes were being submitted.I think the code was dormant for awhile, but later I saw someone named Russ Cox started submitting a ton of changes to it.  That became the public Google Code Search product [2].  My memory is that Russ wrote something like 30K lines of google3 C++ in a single summer, and then went on to write RE2 (which I later used in Bigtable, etc.)Much of that work is described here: https://swtch.com/~rsc/regexp/I remember someone telling him on a mailing list something like \"you can't just write your own regex engine; there are too many corner cases in PCRE\"And many people know that Russ Cox went on to be one of the main contributors to the Go language.  After the Code Search internship, he worked on Go, which was open sourced in 2009.---[1] Actually I wonder if today if this could perform well enough a single machine with 64 or 128 cores.  Back then I think the prod machines were something like 2, 4, or 8 cores.[2] This was the trigram regex search over open source code on the web.

          "content": "A bit more detail: long ago, before the time of the Great Brace War, people wrote code using all sorts of styles: tabs/spaces, short or long variable/function names, Hungarian notation or not, comments or not, long blocks or short, and so on. You could often tell which of your teammates wrote a block of code simply by newline usage. This made it hard to read and contribute code in a less familiar part of the codebase.Google mitigated this problem at scale by introducing the concept of \"readability\" for each language (C++, Java, and Python, simpler times). If you had readability, you could approve another person's change for that language. If you didn't, you could still review the code, but the reviewee also had to go find someone else with readability.After you'd accumulated a certain number of commits in a language, you could try to get your own readability by bundling up your CLs (changelists) and submitting them to the readability queue, where a certain group of senior people with readability would evaluate whether your code was sufficiently idiomatic. This process could take months, or even years if you didn't write much in a particular language. In any event, it felt like a real achievement to get readability.The upshot of all this was that most code at Google felt authorless in a good way: if you knew and expected Google style, all the codebase felt the same, and you could concentrate on the logic flow rather than the regional dialect. And needless to say all the energy wasted on whose style was best was squelched in the readability queue.This is all past tense because I last wrote code for Google more than 10 years ago, and I'm sure the process has changed since then. Code formatters, shared editor defaults, and presubmit checks have surely automated away a lot of the toil, and there's much less of a monorepo culture these days, so there are probably more style dialects (in addition to many, many more permitted languages).",

But turns out there are many situations where TPMs are not reliable for non-malicious reasons. Some examples:\n* https://github.com/tailscale/tailscale/issues/17654\n* https://github.com/tailscale/tailscale/issues/18288\n* https://github.com/tailscale/tailscale/issues/18302\n* plus a number of support ticketsTPMs are a great tool for organizations that have good control of their devices. But the very heterogeneous fleet of devices that Tailscale users have is very difficult to support out of the box. So for now we leave it to security-conscious users and admins to enable, while avoiding unexpected breakage for the broader user base.We should've provided more of this context in the changelog, apologies!",

This is literally yoga and meditation practice and has been studied for at least a couple thousand years.Even if we exclude the modern invention of yoga as exercise in the 20th century, there are seated practices of releasing these tensions in the body. It's not even framed in mystical terms, it's literally just opening the body and getting rid of discomfort, pain, and stress in the body so that you can sit and focus for longer periods of time in your formal meditation practice.Even in the author's teacher's capital V Vipassana tradition, invented in the 20th century, it is known that the piti that arises even in the first stages of meditation can be directed. That weak piti is just the piloerection response, which is an autonomic response, and if you can control it it would seem to imply we of course have facility over things science assumes we have no control over.",

This wasn't qualitative either; imaging technology shows activity unevenly occurs across every human body. Put an ice cube on someones hand, their left knee tissues may react. Put ice cube on another person's hand, back of their neck reacts not their left knee.Then there are stories of people missing the majority of their brain but only learned this medically after living a normal life; going to college, holding a career together for a couple decades.Brain-centrism was just as dumb as our other takes that attempt to demarcate a center to our center-less universe.

      "abstract": "该讨论围绕“拿破仑技巧”（通过推迟任务提升效率）展开。社区成员分享了各自对这一时间管理策略的应用与反思。有人认为该方法能有效区分任务优先级，让非紧急事务自行解决或变得更清晰，尤其适用于低风险决策。也有用户指出，推迟需设定明确检查点，避免滑向纯粹的拖延；部分人结合艾森豪威尔矩阵或Cynefin框架，强调在复杂情境中“让问题自行消解”的可行性。讨论中提到，该方法在职场沟通和育儿中同样有效，能培养自主解决问题能力。但存在分歧：支持者认为主动推迟可保留选择权、减少无效劳动；反对者则警告这可能演变为逃避沟通或积累压力，尤其对注意力缺陷群体风险较高。普遍共识是，技巧成功关键在于有意识地延迟而非被动回避，并需建立信任以避免误解。",

Andy Grove has a paragraph on this in High Output Management as one of the highest negative leverage things a manager can do to their team, and in fact, often a wrong (but correctible) decision is far better than no decision.Good managers instinctively know how to navigate these tradeoffs.",

I've started replying with \"I'll look at this tomorrow\" rather than going silent. Same delay, but it signals intentionality.

It encourages dependence and self-centeredness. It's criminal and produces a class of people that will pay the salaries of therapists for decades.The opposite extreme is parental absenteeism which is like a football match without a referee. Someone always influences children - their habits, their worldview, their attitudes - and if a parent isn't doing that, then someone else is, and perhaps not someone who should. Absenteeism is thus a dereliction of parental duty, as parents serve as examples from whom children learn, even more by how they behave and live than by what they say. We are social animals, and a healthy family life produces healthy people.And by following this middle path well, you also teach your children to be able to be appropriately helpful to others themselves and in this manner, able to discern when help is appropriate and when it is not.

Not a huge amount compared to the big libs, but OTOH, people actually use my stuff. For this I have received exactly $0 (if they were Spotify or YouTube streams I would realistically be looking at ~$100,000).I propose that we have two NPMs. A non-commercial NPM that is 100% use at your own risk, and a commerical NPM that has various guarantees that authors and maintainers are paid to uphold.",

But there’s also a lot of corporate maintainers - and I feel like part of that is because packages are namespaces to the repository - which itself is namespaced to ownership.

In our last release of dozens of packages, I was manually reading though our package-lock and package.json changes and reviewing every dependency change. Luckily our core libraries have no external dependencies, but our tooling has a ton.We were left with a tough choice of moving to Trusted Publishers or allowing a few team members to publish locally with 2FA. We decided on Trusted Publishers because we've had an automated process with review steps for years, but we understand there's still a chance of a hack, so we're just extremely cautious with any PRs right now. Turning on Trusted Publishers was a huge pain with so many package.The real thing we want for publishing is for us is to be able to continue to use our CI-based publishing setup, with Trusted Publishers, but with a human-in-the-loop 2FA step.But that's only part of a complete solution.

Support is restricted to a small number of CI providers, it cannot be used for the first publish of a new package, and it does not yet offer enforcement mechanisms such as mandatory 2FA at publish time. Those constraints have led maintainer groups to caution against treating trusted publishing as a universal upgrade, particularly for high-impact or critical packages.This isn't strictly accurate: when we designed Trusted Publishing for PyPI, we designed it to be generic across OIDC IdPs (typically CI providers), and explicitly included an accommodation for creating new projects via Trusted Publishing (we called it \"pending\" publishers[1]). The latter is something that not all subsequent adopters of the Trusted Publishing technique have adopted, which is IMO both unfortunate and understandable (since it's a complication over the data model/assumptions around package existence).I think a lot of the pains here are self-inflicted on GitHub's part here: deciding to remove normal API credentials entirely strikes me as extremely aggressive, and is completely unrelated to implementing Trusted Publishing.

Meanwhile solo devs who publish from their local machine with 2FA are arguably more secure (smaller attack surface, human in the loop) but are being pushed toward automation.What I'd like to see: a middle ground where trusted publishing works but requires a 2FA confirmation before the publish actually goes through.

I've been working on a similar real-time globe visualization and learned a few things the hard way:1. Throttling updates is critical. We went from per-event updates to 5-10 second batches and cut our WebSocket costs by 90%+ while the UX barely changed.2. For the \"ships crossing land\" artifacts people are noticing - interpolating between sparse data points on a Mercator projection will always create these. On a globe (orthographic), great circle interpolation looks correct, but on flat maps you need to detect ocean crossings and handle them specially.3. The biggest perf win was hybrid rendering: static heatmap for historical data + WebGL particles only for \"live\" movement. Trying to animate everything kills mobile.Would love to see this with more recent data. The 2012 snapshot is fascinating but comparing pre/post-Suez blockage or COVID disruptions would be incredible.",

The international maritime and aerospace system is far too complicated and large that you could ever build a private network of every ship or plane operator sharing encrypted data, or that one company could set up receivers for the tracking data worldwide. A closed system wouldn't work.Rail is both physically and legally a finite closed space. The network operator knows definitively where every train in their network is because they have sensors in the tracks. The network is responsible for preventing collisions, not the individual trains. They have contracts with every company which operates on their tracks and if these need their internal data they can get it.

Really interesting work.Michael presented at the Berlin Geomob. His website has a more general overview of what he does: https://www.michaelcruickshank.me/recentwork. That does not seem to include a lot of detail on what he presented. Possibly because he is trying to be responsible here.The security angle did come during the presentation. This is not the type of information that a lot of governments would want to make public but also something that could help them. You can mine a lot of intelligence from public data. And his approach of doing some kind of scenario modelling on top of the open data actually is interesting. That's something that can be used for good and for evil.

Would be interesting how much aluminium/lead/copper such a project would take. EDIT: found a supplier that specifies a 1GW cable at 7000 tons per spool. A spool is 130km of cable, so that's 350 000 tons of cable per GW for the transatlantic link. So just the raw aluminium is around a billion dollars per GW.Anyway, first we have to properly connect those two sun belts to the rest of their own continental masses with UHVDC, then we have a lot of political problems to solve, and then we can check battery prices...",

Alice Springs isn't connected to the grid servicing most of Australia's population crammed up along the East coast and doesn't have much in the way of heavy industrial users nearby. The difficulty for OSM mappers is the low-capacity above-ground power lines in Alice Springs have no more pixels as the trunk of any 20 year old tree so at satellite imagery resolutions of >30cm you may need to find an image taken at sunrise or sunset where the long shadow of a pole is visible on the ground. I also think it is preferred in remote locations such as Alice Springs to run lines underground (particularly along roads) due to decreased total cost of ownership of not having to worry about bushfire and flood damage to infrastructure.The ACT government provides ~10cm aerial imagery of Canberra and surrounds a few times a year and from this imagery, unless a minor power pole is obscured by trees or a building, it is generally easy to identify most poles. Evoenergy (distribution operator for the ACT) also publicly provide detailed maps of poles and lines no matter how minor they are. The reason this detail won't be mapped in OSM is lack of interest and availability of mappers to micro-map every minor power pole from aerial imagery, and OSM's very conservative approach to importing datasets, particularly from a licensing perspective (e.g. attempting to apply European database directive concerns in countries like Australia which don't have equivalent laws, and even have opposing case law precedents).Australia is one of the most open countries when it comes to supplying electrical grid data. Even underground conduit locations are available publicly for most distributors, as well as designed summer/winter constraints for each transmission line (e.g. maximum kA per line).

These days it wins solely by virtue of being one of the few that's still populated and free.When I tried to go back to the Simultronics ones (Gemstone IV and Dragon Realms), not only was it a ghost town, which made random interactions almost stressful because you feel like two people walking past each other in a ghost town, but they have double, triple, and quadrupled down on squeezing their whales for every cent. A lot of people playing that game are paying $50-100 a month or more, and even normal players have to cough up more than the base $15 a month subscription if they want more than 1 character (!!!). Looks like their website has been stripped of all its cool character too. Shame.These games in their heyday were truly a one of a kind experience.

MUDs are just text, and tinyfugue must have had something which made allowed for easy capture and scripting because I did a TON of that. Sure, had to learn \"regular expressions\", but that was fun too!There was some random phoenix which used to spawn somewhere. You couldn't teleport to it, but you could teleport near it, and I somehow scripted up a seek and destroy phoenix button. Can't recall why, it dropped something useful but not that useful, so mostly it was just the fun of watching the rooms zoom by (textually) and the joy of seeing a code creation work, insignificant as it was.Thanks, Lasher, for keeping it alive all these years.

Namely, I helped someone else on the MUD code on his other MUD, and I saw that he never installed libcrypt or whatever, so I could view players' passwords in plaintext. Since I new him from the main MUD we played, there were a bunch of people I knew playing in both, at least to check out this guy's project.

It seems they've recently added ways for players to accumulate \"credits\" (the premium currency) just by playing the game normally -- it's called the \"renown\" system. (And there have always been other programs that involve volunteering behind the scenes -- the most obvious and in-the-open one is being an official newbie guide.)I haven't felt any strong desire to put money into Achaea, personally. There are a lot of nice-to-haves, and yes, a good number of premium artefacts that give real advantages in gameplay; but the selling point for me has always been the RP-focused world and community, and mechanically speaking you don't need artefacts for PvE. Probably the most common premium items I've seen are non-decaying vials (which are, IIRC, extremely cheap and very accessible via accumulated renown) and the Atavian wings that let you travel to a lot of different locations very quickly.I did make a small cash purchase once, to ensure that my character would never get deleted from inactivity, but these days it seems a sufficient amount of total game time is enough to avoid that fate.I'd definitely recommend Achaea if you're interested in a heavily character-driven world with a community that's passionate about roleplay. The cash shop is by no means a necessity (unless you're getting very deep into PvP, where my expertise runs out, so it could go either way). The volunteer staff (the \"Garden of the Gods\", as it were) are super active with both large and small RP events, so there's a lot of both official and \"unofficial\" goings-on in the world. It's really fantastic.(If anybody here remembers Soludra, hi, that was me!)",

I always use the command line version, and it works perfectly fine and it's FOSS.I find the syntax to Typst to be generally better than LaTeX. I don't like its equations as much, but Typst has one huge advantage that makes it easier to forgive its faults: it compiles several orders of magnitude faster than LaTeX.  This might not sound like much but it honestly sort of changes how you even think about problems.  I keep Neovim open on the left, run `typst watch` in the background, and Evince on the right, and my updates show up immediately upon saving.Also, adding plugins and libraries is trivial. All you have to do is declare it at the top of the file and it will automatically fetch it, which is considerably easier than LaTeX.I don't like the default font it ships with, but it's easy enough to add a Latin Modern font and get something that looks like LaTeX.Before Typst, I had typically been using Pandoc with Markdown to write my documents, and that served me well for quite awhile, but it had the disadvantage of being extremely slow to compile.  A slide deck that I gave last year [1] would take a bit more than a minute to compile.  This became an issue because I had to make a few small last-minute changes and having to wait an entire minute to view them actually made it so I was really pushing against the wire.If I had done my slides in Typst, they would have compiled in about 40 milliseconds, they wouldn't have looked any worse, and I'd have a syntax not dissimilar to Markdown.  I'm pretty much a convert at this point.[1] https://git.sr.ht/~tombert/lambda_days_2025",

I know this because those AWS / K8S / Google Cloud libraries cause MASSIVE problems with their constant breaking changes without major version changes, and their importing other libraries that also have frequent breaking changes without major version changes, even if the dependency those unused subpackages include (and therefore raise the minimum version) is only used by some other module that needs a lower version (iirc).  It's quite a headache sometimes, and could be rather easily solved if you could set upper bounds and not just lower.  Or if those giga-projects would stop doing such obviously bad things.The version-affecting behavior is kinda unavoidable afaict.  If they didn't include those unused version constraints, `go build ...` or just importing a new package within existing modules could cause your build to fail, forcing you to rerun version resolution.  That'd probably just lead people to feel like \"go is broken UGH\", and go leans awfully hard towards avoiding that kind of thing. Mostly for the better, but not quite always / not in all ways.",

While the Rust community refers to Cargo.toml as a manifest, it is not a comprehensive and detailed list of a build.

In other words, the versions given are the lower bound of the compatibility range.Go also strictly follows semantic versioning. Thus the implicit exclusive upper bound is the next major version. This assumes that all minor and patch releases are backwards compatibile and not breaking.Dependency resolution in Go uses minimum version selection. That means the minimum requirements of all dependencies are evaluated and highest minimums are selected. In principle, this minimum version selection should be time invariant since the oldest versions of the compatible dependencies are usedWhile the minimum versions specified in go.mod are not necessarily the version of the dependencies used, they can be resolved to the versions used irrespective of time or later versions of dependencies being released.Other languages do not use minimum version selection. Their package resolution often tries to retrieve the latest compatible dependency. Thus a lock file is needed.Python packages in particular do not follow semantic versioning. Thus ranges are critical in a pyproject.toml.In summary, the \"manifests\" files that the original author describes are configuration files.

What is CPU microcode, for instance, hardware or software? It’s really low level software that is typically burned into a ROM but is also sometimes downloaded. Even if you decide to stay with software as your primary day to day job, you’ll be comfortable talking to engineers on the other side of the line and that will help inform your understanding of what’s possible, how much it will cost to design and ship it, how long it will take, and how it will perform.",

I use it in pen mode (where the area of the tablet maps to the screen) - you can also configure it in mouse mode (like a touchpad, where the movement is relative to where the cursor is on the screen) which should work better with multi-display setups, though it's not to my preference. I have my pen/stylus setup so that tapping it onto the tablet acts as a left/primary click, the larger button on the pen is right click, and holding the smaller button and dragging on the tablet is scroll/pan).MacOS is well-supported once the drivers are installed, though sometimes the driver doesn't seem to pick up tablet (either after the laptop or tablet goes to sleep). Restarting the driver fixes this, though this bug seems to have been fixed in the latest driver release. Linux works out of the box (at least on KDE/Arch), though sadly customization support on Wayland isn't quite there yet compared with what you could do on X11 (with the xsetwacom utility). For drawing support though it should work perfectly but as far as I know you can't the the button functionality, which is a bummer when using it as a pointing device.The main benefit for me is that it feels much more ergonomic compared with a regular mouse or even a vertical mouse or trackball and I don't get anywhere near as much wrist or shoulder pain - especially in the cold temps in the middle of winter where I am. There is a bit of an adjustment period and I find for interacting with small UI elements such as buttons it can be a bit tricky, but for me the benefits outweigh the downsides. The only other downside I can think of is that when using the tablet over bluetooth (wired is also an option and tracks a little more smoothly) the battery only lasts 1½ days compared with the weeks/months a wireless mouse would go for.",

I configure left click to be done by touching the tablet with the stylus and the 2 buttons that are on the stylus to generate right click and double left click.The advantage over a mouse or trackball is the much more comfortable position of the hand and also the much higher speed and accuracy of positioning. Moving the pointer to any location on the screen is instantaneous and without any effort, due the lightness of the stylus and to the lack of contact with the tablet.Because the stylus is extremely light, I can touch type on the keyboard while still keeping the stylus between my fingers. This allows faster transitions between keyboard and graphic pointer than with a standard mouse (because the time needed to grip the mouse is eliminated). Only when I type longer texts, I drop the stylus on the tablet.The tablet is no bigger than a traditional mouse pad, so it does not need a bigger space on the desk.After switching to use exclusively a graphic tablet, I would never want to use again a mouse, trackball, trackpoint or touchpad. I only regret that I have never thought earlier to try this.Besides being a better mouse than a mouse, a tablet obviously allows to do things for which a mouse is inappropriate, e.g. drawing or handwriting (e.g. for signing a document).I should mention that I have always used the Wacom tablets with Linux. I have never tried them on Windows, so I do not know if there they work as well.",

Connect the fun doohikie to give feedback to the microcontroller — e.g. using some kind of an encoder chip that converts motor's rotation amount to numbers that will tell the microcontroller how much to move, initialize the doohikie's start state.But you can understand a lot more if you don't use the HBridge chip  for the motor. Build the bridge circuit yourself. Build your own power supply for the microcontroller too(if you want to).You can pick a path to go down on and focus on specific parts:1. For the h bridge there is lots to learn. Designing the operational amp for D2A conversion as well as amplification/signal modeling — which you will need for the motor for current limiting in the h bridge per motor spec for the doohickie you want to power —  That will teach you quite a bit about analog electronics and design.  What kind of currents you need to protect and how e.g. using opto electronics. Limiting noise from power supply and parasitic noise so that your circuit does not misfire. You will likely need a set up of an oscilloscope, soldering irons and breadboards to prototype. Learn some basics from a book about design then go back to the circuit and build.2. If you build your own PCB for this. It is a multi month project. You can learn a out CAD and chip layout. But I think you can do this in parts for example you can design the initial PCB only for the digital components and then connect it to a breadboard where you can prototype the H bridge you want.3. If you choose to learn digital design and embedded system programming then maybe you can build the tougher analog parts for motor control using store-bought components and chips and focus mostly on the programming the microcontroller. That is a totally legitimate part too. You could use an old MCS-51 microcontroller and learn about data and program memory addressing and interrupt handling from scratch.",

          "content": "> With a small light source even a small change in position on the surface has big effects on the light’s visibility – it quickly becomes fully visible or fully occluded. On the other hand, with a big light source that transition is much smoother – the distance on the floor surface between a completely exposed and completely invisible light source is much larger.This part of the demo illustrates the point vs area light issue really well. In designing practical 3d scenes and selecting tools, we would often prefer to use 2d area or 3d volumetric lights over point lights. Difficult problems like hard shadows and hotspots in reflection probes are magically resolved if we can afford to use these options. Unfortunately, in many realtime scenarios you cannot get access to high quality area or volumetric lighting without resorting to baking lightmaps (static objects only; lots of iteration delay) or nasty things like temporal antialiasing.",

          "content": "There is a solution called Radiance Cascades [1] which doesn't require a denoiser for rendering real-time shadows for volumetric lights. Unfortunately the approach is relatively slow, so solutions based on denoising are still more efficient (though also expensive) in terms of the quality/performance tradeoff.One issue with modern ReSTIR path tracing is that currently the algorithm relies on white (random) noise, which contains low-frequency (large-scale) noise, which produces blotchy boiling artifacts at low sample counts. Optimally an algorithm should use some form of spatio-temporal blue noise with exponential decay to only get evenly distributed high frequency samples. But that's still an open research problem.1: https://youtube.com/watch?v=rG2aok2SdbU",

It’s relatively easy to understand if you think of it in terms of the surface of a sphere. There is a fixed amount of light coming from a point source, and as the light travels outward you can think of it as being spread over the surface of a sphere. Since the surface area of a sphere is 4pir^2, if you double the radius the area quadruples, and therefore the light intensity at any point on the sphere drops by a factor of four.edit: And now after rtfm I see there's a nice demo of this!",

No linear algebra here, just a cosine (actually a dot product in disguise) and the inverse square law (1/r²), two equations he considered too fundamental to skip. Also notable is the lack of exercises.But now that you have read this page, and played with the interactive elements, you probably have a good understanding of how lights and shadows work, but can you write a 3D engine or even just calculate exposure time without your camera helping you? Without prior knowledge, probably not. For that, you actually need to do the maths, with exercises and all that. And by the way, look at the source code (it is not obfuscated), all the linear algebra that is not present in the article is there!That, I think, explain the discrepancy between edutainment and textbooks. Textbooks are for you to do actual work, do the maths, solve problems, etc... not just give you an overview. That's also why is takes way longer and requires a lot more effort on the student part.Interactive content like this one is good, and maybe it should be given a bit more consideration by the traditional educational system.

Your job is to build a neural-network Google results page for that mini internet of tokens.In traditional search, we are given a search query, and we want to find web pages via an intermediate search results page with 10 blue links. Basically, when we're Googling something, we want to know \"What web pages are relevant to this given search query?\", and then given those links we ask \"what do those web pages actually say?\" and click on the links to answer our question. In this case, the \"Query\" is obviously the user search query, the \"Key\" is one of the ten blue links (usually the title of the page), and the \"Value\" is the content of the web page that link goes to.In the attention mechanism, we are given a token and we want to find its meaning when contextualized with other tokens. Basically, we are first trying to answer the question \"which other tokens are relevant to this token?\", and then given the answer to that we ask \"what is the meaning of the original token given these other relevant tokens?\" The \"Query\" is a given token in the input text, the \"Key\" is another token in the input text, and the \"Value\" is the final meaning of the original token with that other token in context (in the form of an embedding). For a given token, you can imagine it is as though the attention mechanism \"clicked the 10 blue links\" of the other most relevant tokens in the input and combined them in some way to figure out the meaning of the original query token (and also you might imagine we ran such a query in parallel for every token in the input text at the same time).So the self attention mechanism is basically google search but instead of a user query, it's a token in the input, instead of a blue link, it's another token, and instead of a web page, it's meaning.",

It's approachable and also detailed.As an aside, does anyone else find the whole \"database lookup\" motivation for QKV kind of confusing? (in the article, \"Query (Q): What am I looking for? Key (K): What do I contain? Value (V): What information do I actually hold?\"). I've never really got it and I just switched to thinking of QKV as a way to construct a fairly general series of linear algebra transformations on the input of a sequence of token embedding vectors x that is quadratic in x and ensures that every token can relate to every other token in the NxN attention matrix. After all, the actual contents and \"meaning\" of QKV are very opaque: the weights that are used to construct them are learned during training. Furthermore, there is a lot of symmetry between Q and K in the algebra, which gets broken only by the causal mask. Or do people find this motivation useful and meaningful in some deeper way? What am I missing?[edit: on this last question, the article on \"Attention is just Kernel Smoothing\" that roadside_picnic posted below looks really interesting in terms of giving a clean generalized mathematical approach to this, and also affirms that I'm not completely off the mark by being a bit suspicious about the whole hand-wavy \"database lookup\" Queries/Keys/Values interpretation]",

          "content": "The confusing thing about attention in this article (and the famous \"Attention is all you need\" paper it's derived from) is the heavy focus on self-attention. In self-attention, Q/K/V are all derived from the same input tokens, so it's confusing to distinguish their respective purposes.I find attention much easier to understand in the original attention paper [0], which focuses on cross-attention for machine translation. In translation, the input sentence to be translated is tokenized into vectors {x_1...x_n}. The translated sentence is autoregressively generated into tokens {y_1...y_m}. To generate y_j, the model computes a similarity score of the previously generated token y_{j-1} against every x_i via the dot product s_{i,j} = x_i*K*y_{j-1}, transformed by the Key matrix. These are then softmaxed to create a weight vector a_j = softmax_i(s_{i,j}). The weighted average of X = [x_1|...|x_n] is taken with respect to a_j and transformed by the Value matrix, i.e. c_j = V*X*a_j. c_j is then passed to additional network layers to generate the output token y_j.tl;dr: given the previous output token, compute its similarity to each input token (via K). Use those similarity scores to compute a weighted average across all input tokens, and use that weighted average to generate the next output token (via V).Note that in this paper, the Query matrix is not explicitly used. It can be thought of as a token preprocessor: rather than computing s_{i,j} = x_i*K*y_{j-1}, each x_i is first linearly transformed by some matrix Q. Because this paper used an RNN (specifically, an LSTM) to encode the tokens, such transformations on the input tokens are implicit in each LSTM module.[0] https://arxiv.org/pdf/1508.04025 (predates \"Attention is all you need\" by 3 years)",

      "abstract": "该讨论围绕Notion AI存在未修复的数据泄露漏洞展开。核心争议在于大型语言模型（LLM）的安全架构是否本质存在缺陷。有用户认为LLM的安全防护在结构上难以实现，因为其输入混合了可信系统指令和不可信用户数据，攻击面实为“无限的人类语言空间”，因此建议始终将LLM输出视为不可信。也有用户指出问题根源在于浏览器未经用户明确许可即访问URL，并呼吁回归本地桌面软件以提升控制权。讨论中普遍批评Notion对安全漏洞响应不力，包括将漏洞报告标记为“不适用”且未从过往事件中吸取教训。部分用户借此延伸至对SaaS模式的质疑，认为不应将所有数据托管于云服务，并期待一次付费的本地应用复兴。共识在于，当前社会尚未建立对数据安全承诺失效的有效追责机制，且用户应对消费级服务保持警惕，避免托管重要数据。",
