      "abstract": "Discord宣布下月起将要求用户通过人脸扫描或身份证验证来获取完整访问权限，旨在为青少年提供更安全的体验。社区讨论围绕隐私安全、政策透明度及平台垄断等议题展开。\n\n多数用户对强制身份验证表示担忧。有人认为此举名义上保护青少年，实则模糊了“不当内容”的定义，可能导致过度审查。也有用户指出Discord此前曾发生数据泄露事件，约7万用户身份证照片外泄，因此对其数据安全承诺存疑。讨论中提到，用户质疑AI人脸分析技术的可靠性，且担心验证可能外包给第三方公司，导致生物信息被长期留存。\n\n部分用户提出替代方案，建议由苹果/谷歌等设备商进行本地年龄验证，避免平台直接收集身份信息。同时，有观点批评Discord逐渐恶化却垄断游戏社区，希望此次争议能推动用户转向更开放平台。\n\n共识在于用户普遍不信任平台的数据处理能力，分歧则集中在是否应完全拒绝验证、或通过技术手段最小化隐私风险。此外，有声音警示大型科技公司集中掌控身份数据的长期社会风险。",

But I think this is a reasonable place for me to post some thoughts.Given current events in the USA, I can't emphasize enough how worried one should be about the fact that a few companies like Discord, Google (Gmail), and Meta have databases with access to the private conversations of hundreds of millions of people with their closest friends and family members, linked up with their identity.Some of the big strengths of running a self-hosted Zulip server for your community are:- Zulip servers are operationally simple, highly stable and easy to upgrade.- Zulip is much better than Discord or Slack for managing the firehose of busy communities. Or at least, a lot of people tell us that they prefer the user experience to everything else they've tried, after a few weeks of getting used to it. :)- Your community leaders get to make the policy decisions about data protection, identity, etc.- It's 100% FOSS software, with an extremely readable and maintainable codebase that ~1500 people have successfully contributed code to. I don't think you'll find modern alternatives with a comparable featureset to Discord that are more resilient to the sponsoring company being acquired or going out of business.- We are a values-focused organization (https://zulip.com/values/) where providing a public service is important to us all.- Each server is completely self-contained and independent, with the only centralized services needed from us being desktop/mobile app publication and mobile push notifications delivery (which is free for community use and soon to be E2EE).I'm happy to answer any questions.",

Governments want to police speech online and be able to arrest people who say things they don't approve of, so they are pushing platforms to collect user's PID. Some also want to discourage people from doing things they don't want them to do but that are politically unfeasible to criminalize (watching videos of consenting adults engaging in all kinds of sexual acts) and adding more and more friction to the process (no pun intended!) is the best thing they can get. And the internet companies want more of your data to track you.",

I had to repeatedly record videos for it only to fail over and over again. Anything their system flags as suspicious, anything, will trigger the same video identification flow again, which effectively blocks your money in the account.I’m closing my accounts with a couple of banks with these video id flows. Simply because it’s way too easy to lose access to my money in the account with them.

          "content": "> There was an appeal button; she was asked to take a picture of her face from many angles and upload ID. She gave them everything they asked for, but when Facebook reviewed the appeal, they closed her account permanently.I can't speak for every company, but I know with Facebook and Paypal, these requests generally are from automated systems and the chances of successfully reopening the account is well under 1%. The info you submit is not viewed by a human and the systems are mostly treated as a way to lighten the load on human support staff. They don't care if your account is reopened, they just want you to feel like you had a chance, did all you could, and then just give up.I discovered this about 20 years ago dealing with Paypal. I happened to know someone who worked in Paypal engineering at the time. I had a well established account, a Paypal debit card, linked accounts, etc., everything you could need to feel good about an account.Out of the blue it was suspended and I was sent into this system to send in verification documents. I gave everything it wanted. First it was ID, then a \"utility bill\" so I sent over my phone bill. That wasn't acceptable because it didn't prove I lived at my address for some reason, so I sent a natural gas bill. Even though that did have to be tied to a physical address (you can't deliver gas wirelessly!) I was asked for an electric bill. Then the lease. Then a bank statement. Every time I gave it pretty quickly. Then I was asked for a passport. I didn't have one. Suddenly that was the only thing that could unlock my account and as soon as they had the passport my account would be reopened. Nothing further would be done without a passport, not even communication.I asked my friend to look into it. She said, \"that's on purpose, that's the NoBot. It gets people out of support's hair.\" Turns out if you let unhappy customers complain to humans on the phone they will, so some exec decided to improve call center metrics by forcing customers into a system designed to keep them occupied until they gave up. You funneled people into it, and it would continue to reject their submissions with new reasons infinitely. It just went through a list of things to ask for, and when it found one you couldn't provide, suddenly that was the key and without it you were screwed.Companies still do this today.",

          "content": "Some of the big weaknesses of running a self-hosted Zulip server for your community are:- Your server admin can see DMs (or at least metadata, not sure if Zulip does E2E for DMs). The same is true for centralized services in theory, but unless you're a terrorist or a person of interest to a major government, it's extremely unlikely that a Discord employee will have an incentive to spy on your messages specifically. Your admin is likely part of your community and may know you personally, so the temptation is much, much higher.- If the admin dies and nobody else has the keys to the kingdom, the server can go down at any point, and there's no way for users to reconstitute the network semi-automatically. Discord servers don't just go away unless somebody actively makes them to.- It's much less secure in practice, it relies on your admin to always be on guard and constantly update their server to prevent vulnerabilities, either in Zulip or in the myriad of other self-hosted services running on it. One guy in his basement that goes on vacation once a year and has family responsibilities is far more likely to make mistakes than a team of trained cybersecurity professionals.- Many Discord users are in 20+ servers. Anything that doesn't provide a one-click server joining experience (for users who already have an account on a different server) is nowhere near a Discord replacement.- People want bots (for things like high-fidelity Youtube music streaming on voice channels), and those are mostly Discord-only.- Anything open source will be worse at phishing and fraud / abuse prevention by definition, as many fraud-prevention approaches rely on the fraudster blindly guessing at what the code and ML models (do you even have ML models for this) are doing.",

I can tell you about some unusual choices we've intentionally made to minimize risk for our users:- We eschewed VC funding. A big part of my motivation was that I felt that VC funding usually requires eventual enshittification. https://zulip.com/values/ talks more about this.- Zulip has been 100% FOSS software for more than a decade.- At the very beginning, we built a complete data import/export system that allows migrating between our Cloud hosting and self-hosting; we put a lot of care into maintaining it well.I can't promise that we'll never have something to sell for self-hosting communities. For example, I could imagine offering a paid add-on for encrypted backups.That said, I'd like to push back on the idea that charging businesses for a tool that's an important part of their daily work \"breaks the seal\". Organizations with a software budget should be happier to pay a fair price for ethical, user-first software from a friendly vendor than for a closed-source product from a megacorp.

So if you want your self-hosted Zulip server to work with the Zulip client apps in the App Store and Play Store, you have to use Zulip's push server, and there's nothing Zulip can do to fix that.Matrix works analogously; if you use the Element app from the App Store or Play Store, then you're using Element's push notification server, even if your Matrix homeserver is self-hosted. It's possible that Element allows their server to be used gratis in situations where Zulip charges a fee, I don't know their policies or anything, but in principle Matrix still leaves you exactly as dependent on a third party's goodwill unless you make your friends install a privately distributed mobile app.Zulip IIUC does not restrict self-hosting of any feature that's technically possible to self-host.",

I think Zulip is just a bit too heavy-duty for a friend group chatting, and also lacks the visual polish that a lot of people want.For now, my friends and I mostly just use Signal for group chats, which leaves a lot to be desired, but IMO is still just a better experience for our purposes than Zulip or Matrix.That said, if you have friends who are keen to try things out, I would definitely recommend at least trying Zulip and see what you like and what you don't. It has a lot of really nice features and things to love.Having interacted a fair amount with the Zulip devs over the years, and being an open-source product, I believe that they have no plans or intention of trying to fleece or milk self-hosted users or small communities.",

It started as me scratching my own itch, and now it’s turning into a real platform.Each game adds more building blocks to the editor: multiplayer, event systems, NPC behaviors, pathfinding, etc. I build a system once, and then anyone using the editor can use it in a click.\nFor game logic, I recently added a visual event system I’m really excited about. It’s kind of like Unreal Blueprints, but focused on 2D. You pick a trigger, wire conditions, and chain actions in a node graph [1].Big challenge right now: most people who want to make games needs assets, and don't know how to get/make them. So I’m building a marketplace where pixel artists can upload tilesets/characters, and unlike itch.io, assets are usable directly inside the engine. No ZIP downloads or import setup, just browse and drop into your game. A preview here[2].Also, if you want to use the editor but ship elsewhere, you can export terrain, animations, and hitboxes to Godot 4.

I learn much better working with real code and this was a great experience. It was certainly a different experience than it would have been without an LLM teacher, reviewer, helper, assistant. The app was beautifully designed and very cleanly implemented back in Java 1.4 days of 2004 so it has been a joy to modernize it while attempting to preserve the clean design.  The OpenGL work and the necessary math was a lot different than what I have been doing for most of my career so it was a lot of fun. I will probably continue tinkering with Tribal Trouble occasionally as I still enjoy playing the game. I want to learn Blender to edit/improve the 3D models. (https://github.com/bondolo/tribaltrouble)For now I have mostly moved on from gaming and am instead working on improving the accessibility (#a11y) of the Wireshark network protocol capture/analysis tool. There are a lot of blind and low vision IT folks for whom this tool is a job requirement. The current accessibility is unfortunately poor. I've submitted my first PR and am relearning the Wireshark source after last contributing 20 years ago. It's also been 15 years since the last time I did anything with Qt so that has been a refresher as well. I don't enjoy working in C++ but the goal matters so I will suffer through. (https://wireshark.org)I plan to work on Wireshark for a couple of months at least and then look for something else to contribute to, probably also accessibility related. I have some ideas already about next apps. I'm currently tempted to build an NFC app for iOS in Swift but haven't decided yet. After having built in the last year both Kotlin Compose and TypeScript React apps, none of which I enjoyed very much, I am somewhat curious if Swift and SwiftUI will be more fun.",

Knowing what makes a game actually fun is a skill Claude can't shortcut. You need to playtest, iterate, and develop taste.\n- Art and assets. This is the #1 blocker for most solo devs. Claude can't draw your sprites or design your tilesets.\n- Feel and polish. Tweaking jump curves, screen shake timing, hit feedback — that's all manual iteration. AI will give you \"technically correct\" values that feel lifeless.\n- Architecture decisions. Claude will happily generate an ECS system or a scene manager, but it doesn't know your game's actual needs. Bad architecture early on will cost you weeks later.Start with a tiny scope (like a single-screen platformer), use Claude Code to move fast on the code side, but spend most of your energy on the parts AI can't help with — design and feel.Also, shameless plug,  if you want to skip the code entirely and just focus on making the game, that's what CraftMyGame is for.

Happy to see someone executing it so well.For me, it started when I spent a year and a half reading and digesting books for and against young earth creationism, then eventually for Christianity itself (its historical truth claims). It struck me that the books were just a serialization of some knowledge structure that existed in the authors’ heads, and by reading I was trying to recreate that structure in my own head. And that’s a super inefficient way to go about this business. So there must be a shortcut, some more powerful intermediate representation than just text (text is too general and powerful, and you can’t compute over it… until now with LLMs?)That graph felt a lot like code to me: there’s no unique representation of knowledge in a graph, but there are some that are much more useful than others; building a well-factored graph takes time and taste; graphs are composable and reusable in a way that feels like it could help you discover layers of abstraction in your arguments.",

As the language is similar to python, hopefully it is able to work well syntactically. But of course, the correctness and accuracy of the circuit would be more challenging to get right. Your work at https://www.mikeayles.com/#tokn is very cool! This will be very useful when I try LLMs!I have seen both atopile and tscircuit too and they are really complete it terms of the entire PCB design flow compared to circuitscript, which is just focused on the schematic part.The ato language works well for specifying parts and parameters, but is very basic for defining connectivity. This means that the designer will have minimal control of how the final schematics will turn out. Of course, atopile focuses on the complete design flow, so having nice schematics could be a want rather than a need. For myself, especially in my professional job, clear and well-organized schematics are important not just for understanding and creation, but also troubleshooting the design and eventually improving the design.I did try some automatic layout features for the schematic that balances giving the user some control over the overall schematic, but this was really hard to get right. In the end, I went with the logo/turtle approach and give full layout control to the user.For tscircuit, I like typescript as a programming language and circuitscript itself is created in typescript. But typescript is really clunky to use for schematic design. Coupled with react, there is a lot of extra noise/symbols when looking at the code and for complex designs, it will be challenging to understand and troubleshoot. Moreover, I believe that typescript/javascript is less common among electronics engineers compared to python (which circuitscript is based on).

It is complicated,  but it is normally an incentives problem, most commonly status/ power rather than monetary. Often they have created blocking processes that the company sees as some sort of control or policing. It tends to be rather easy to change that if you are their boss. It is harder, but not impossible as a colleague. Often the application of cold hard rigorous logic,  an understanding of the real controls etc. Can unstick them.I work in a 100k person company at the moment (admittedly I'm not in charge of that many of them), so I understand the problem of scale, but I would counter that the changes neede are rather subtle. I think much can be achieved by focusing on the 20 people at the top. Culture cascades. For example if you dig in over a KPI not being achieved, when someone explains that it is counterproductive, or conflicts with another KPI,  how do you think they will manage their team in future?",

      "abstract": "该讨论围绕欧洲推出新支付系统以替代Visa和Mastercard的举措展开。核心争议在于新方案是否真正实现了技术自主与用户便利。有用户指出，当前方案仍依赖美国控制的智能手机系统（如iOS/Android），可能侵犯隐私权，且未能摆脱对美国企业的依赖。同时，部分用户质疑新系统的必要性，认为现有国内支付系统已足够，跨境转换的实际影响可能被夸大。  \n\n讨论中提到，印度UPI系统的成功案例显示，整合多种支付方式可降低商户成本，但欧洲方案目前缺乏类似灵活性。也有用户强调，银行转账缺乏交易争议机制，可能增加诈骗风险，而Visa/Mastercard在此方面更具保护性。尽管存在分歧，多数用户认同降低支付手续费、提升欧盟支付自主权的目标，但对执行路径的可行性与独立性仍持怀疑态度。",

In Spain, for example, to use Bizum, you need either an Android/iOS smartphone (and for the Android case, as you use it from your bank's app, it would typically require some Google security assurances - so no Huawei phones allowed, for example) or logging into your bank's website and use Bizum from there, only if your bank allows you to use Bizum via web. And it's not very practical or convenient to do that when you're in a store and want to pay, in contrast to swiping your credit card.So while I see very convenient gaining some sovereignty from American companies for these payments, I think we're losing it when we will need devices controlled by other American companies in order to use the new system.",

          "content_cn": "无论他们提出什么方案，我希望这不会把你绑定在谷歌或苹果智能手机上。难道不能用实体卡来实现吗？比如在西班牙，要使用Bizum支付，你需要一部安卓或iOS智能手机（对于安卓用户，由于通过银行应用操作，通常需要谷歌的安全认证——例如华为手机就无法使用），或者登录银行网站进行操作，前提是你的银行支持网页版Bizum。但在商店付款时，这种方式远不如直接刷信用卡方便实用。因此，虽然我认为在支付领域摆脱对美国公司的依赖很有必要，但若新系统仍必须通过其他美国公司控制的设备才能使用，我们可能反而会失去自主权。"

There's also the MasterCard Debit and Visa Debit branding which seem to bridge debit transactions to the MasterCard and Visa networks.  And there's already Interac-capable terminals basically everywhere that Visa and MC are accepted.My thought is that Interac should launch a credit card brand called \"Interac Credit\".  The actual credit would be via the banks, just like it is with Visa and MC.  Interac already has the relationships with merchants and banks to make this happen, and it has the mindshare with consumers to make it successful.",

The same devices that accept UPI (usually some android based POS) also accepted a plethora of cards. Previously merchants would be hesitant to take anything other than cash or charge 2% for visa/mastercard. But with wide adoption of digital payments they now just accept any payment with the goal that they don't want bad reviews and/or lose customers.Point being that with a cheap alternative, it's actually much more convenient now to use a Visa or Mastercard especially with tap to pay because with competition being so high, the diversity means people allow all payments.",

OP is operating as if it's just a debit system moving money from one account to another but:- For many consumers there isn't sufficient money in the account to settle all the one-time and ongoing transactions they are liable for -- credit cards are giving you a revolving loan, there's risk it will not be repaid, and that risk ends up reflected in processing fees- For many _businesses_ managing cash flow is existential -- as merchants they want to be paid as quickly as possible, but as B2B customers they want to have 30-60 days to sell the input goods they've purchased so they can pay for them upstream. There is a premium for that flexibility that gets reflected in processing fees.- For both consumers and merchants, fraud risk is real and while it's the most solvable part of all this it's a real (and costly!) factor today. That risk for fraud gets moved upstream to the networks/acquirers/processors/issuers and that premium shows up in (you guessed it) processing fees.If you want to switch the world to a debit-based system where economic transactions are limited by cash on hand, I'd argue that's a poorer and less dynamic world than the one we're operating in today.",

Sure they have your banks local branding but it's Visa anyway.This also applies to payment terminal, most (not all) go through the Visa payment network to process payments.And even in the same country a lot of online payment either goes through credit cards (again mostly Visa in EU) or PayPal. This isn't technically needed at all but due to fragmentation whatever alternative you want to use is just sometimes available.Which is where Wero comes in:- try to reduce fragmentation by making it a cooperation across many banks (of which most had their own failed PayPal alternative)- onboard people on (local) online banking and private Phone2Phone payment (e.g. bill sharing)- then (now) expand to pushing some payment terminal providers to support it with Phone based payment. There are multiple initiatives for it.The later part is possible due to 3 reasons:- payment apps on phone bypassing secure module monopoly nonsense related to EC/Credit cards and visa- a lot of the in-person checkout systems of small businesses are now a tablet + separate cash register + EC terminal. This means that even if the EC terminal doesn't support Wero the payment system can still do so through their tablet.- Also I think some of the wider used payment terminal in large EU specific chains can get Wero support with a software update.Still it's by far not a perfect situation:- still too much fragmentation/to little adoption by banks- \"old\" payment terminals and (physical) checkout systems which are bound to Visa and can't easily be updatedSo there most likely won't be a hard break anytime soon, and your EC card will likely continue using Visa secure module and network for a very very long time.But having a technical working alternative which can slowly start eating market share is already a huge step forward.",

If we go back to Buckminster Fuller identifying the the \"Knowledge Doubling Curve\", by observing that until 1900, human knowledge doubled approximately every century. By the end of World War II, it was doubling every 25 years.  In his 1981 book \"Critical Path\", he used a conceptual metric he called the \"Knowledge Unit.\"  To make his calculations work, he set a baseline:- He designated the total sum of all human knowledge accumulated from the beginning of recorded history up to the year 1 CE as one \"unit.\"- He then tracked how long it took for the world to reach two units (which he estimated took about 1,500 years, until the Renaissance).Ray Kurzweil took Fuller’s doubling concept and applied it to computer processing power via \"The Law of Accelerating Returns\".  The definition of the singularity in this approach is the limit in time where human knowledge doubles instantly.Why do present day ideas of the singularity not take this approach and instead say \"the singularity is a hypothetical event in which technological growth accelerates beyond human control, producing unpredictable changes in human civilization.\" - Wikipedia",

However, lets say you give it a Terabyte of assembly code - it won't be able to produce correct output as it will run out of context.You can get around that with agentic frameworks, but all of those right now are manually coded.So how do you train an LLM to correctly take any length of assembly code and produce the correct result? The only way is to essentially train the structure of the neurons inside of it behave like a computer, but the problem is that you can't do back-propagation with discrete zero and 1 values unless you explicitly code in the architecture for a cpu inside. So obviously, error correction with inputs/outputs is not the way we get to intelligence.It may be that the answer is pretty much a stochastic search where you spin up x instances of trillion parameter nets and make them operate in environments with some form of genetic algorithm, until you get something that behaves like a Human, and any shortcutting to this is not really possible because of essentially chaotic effects.,",

          "content": "Hey, Boris from the Claude Code team here. I wanted to take a sec to explain the context for this change.One of the hard things about building a product on an LLM is that the model frequently changes underneath you. Since we introduced Claude Code almost a year ago, Claude has gotten more intelligent, it runs for longer periods of time, and it is able to more agentically use more tools. This is one of the magical things about building on models, and also one of the things that makes it very hard. There's always a feeling that the model is outpacing what any given product is able to offer (ie. product overhang). We try very hard to keep up, and to deliver a UX that lets people experience the model in a way that is raw and low level, and maximally useful at the same time.In particular, as agent trajectories get longer, the average conversation has more and more tool calls. When we released Claude Code, Sonnet 3.5 was able to run unattended for less than 30 seconds at a time before going off the rails; now, Opus 4.6 1-shots much of my code, often running for minutes, hours, and days at a time.The amount of output this generates can quickly become overwhelming in a terminal, and is something we hear often from users. Terminals give us relatively few pixels to play with; they have a single font size; colors are not uniformly supported; in some terminal emulators, rendering is extremely slow. We want to make sure every user has a good experience, no matter what terminal they are using. This is important to us, because we want Claude Code to work everywhere, on any terminal, any OS, any environment.Users give the model a prompt, and don't want to drown in a sea of log output in order to pick out what matters: specific tool calls, file edits, and so on, depending on the use case. From a design POV, this is a balance: we want to show you the most relevant information, while giving you a way to see more details when useful (ie. progressive disclosure). Over time, as the model continues to get more capable -- so trajectories become more correct on average -- and as conversations become even longer, we need to manage the amount of information we present in the default view to keep it from feeling overwhelming.When we started Claude Code, it was just a few of us using it. Now, a large number of engineers rely on Claude Code to get their work done every day. We can no longer design for ourselves, and we rely heavily on community feedback to co-design the right experience. We cannot build the right things without that feedback. Yoshi rightly called out that often this iteration happens in the open. In this case in particular, we approached it intentionally, and dogfooded it internally for over a month to get the UX just right before releasing it; this resulted in an experience that most users preferred.But we missed the mark for a subset of our users. To improve it, I went back and forth in the issue to understand what issues people were hitting with the new design, and shipped multiple rounds of changes to arrive at a good UX. We've built in the open in this way before, eg. when we iterated on the spinner UX, the todos tool UX, and for many other areas. We always want to hear from users so that we can make the product better.The specific remaining issue Yoshi called out is reasonable. PR incoming in the next release to improve subagent output (I should have responded to the issue earlier, that's my miss).Yoshi and others -- please keep the feedback coming. We want to hear it, and we genuinely want to improve the product in a way that gives great defaults for the majority of users, while being extremely hackable and customizable for everyone else.",

While refactoring my code it noticed that it needs to see what this command is which it is invoking, so it even went so far as to search through vs code's user data to find the recent files history if it can find out more about that command... I stopped it and told it that if it has problems, it should tell me. It explained it can't find that file, i gave it the paths and tokens were saved.

It's giving the operator enough visibility into what the agent is actually doing without drowning them in noise. There's a narrow band between \"Read 3 files\" (useless) and a full thinking trace dump (unusable), and finding it requires treating observability as a first-class design problem, not a verbosity slider.The frustrating part is that Anthropic clearly understands this in other contexts. Their own research on agent safety talks extensively about the need for human oversight of autonomous actions. But the moment it's their own product, the instinct is to simplify away the exact information that makes oversight possible.The people pinning to 2.1.19 aren't being difficult. They're telling you that when an agent touches my codebase, I need to know which files it read and what it searched for — not because I want to micromanage, but because that's literally the minimum viable audit trail.

Don't you see, even here on HN, people constantly asking for software that is less bloated, that does fewer things but does them better, that code is cost, and every piece of complexity is something that needs to be maintained?As features keep getting added, it is necessary to revisit where the UX is \"too much\" and so things need to be hidden, e.g. menu commands need to be grouped in a submenu, what was toolbar functionality now belongs in a dialog, reporting needs to be limited to a verbose mode, etc.Obviously product teams get it wrong sometimes, users complain, and if enough users complain, then it's brought back, or a toggle to enable it.There's nothing to be cynical about, and it's not something we \"should be over by now.\" It's just humans doing their best to strike the balance between a UX that provides enough information to be useful without so much information that it overwhelms and distracts. Obviously any single instance isn't usually enough to overwhelm and distract, but in aggregate they do, so PM's and designers try to be vigilant to simplify wherever possible.

Open source browsers that work, audio that just works, successors to C/C++ with actual support and adoption, operating systems that respond gracefully under load, etc. ... none of these things were guaranteed, or directly aligned with short-term financial incentives.

Opus/Sonnet is often to step back when the complexity increases too much, and dig an alternative.- I find Opus/Sonnet to be \"lazy\" recently.

      "abstract": "前GitHub CEO推出新的AI开发者平台引发讨论。核心话题围绕该平台的商业模式、技术实现及数据隐私问题展开。有人认为这不过是又一个追逐AI风口的创业项目，质疑其创新性；也有用户指出平台本质是通过收集用户代码和对话数据来训练模型再反租给用户，存在数据隐私风险。讨论中提到“检查点”功能的技术争议，有用户认为它能通过保存推理过程减少重复计算，但也有人质疑调用历史检查点可能带来更高的token成本。部分用户对VC主导的商业模式表示悲观，担心资本会影响产品方向；同时也有声音认为不应过早否定，承认AI开发工具的未来形态尚不明确，这种探索具有价值。普遍共识是数据收集和模型训练方式是需要警惕的关键问题。",

I have had so many project ideas for years that I can just spec out, everything I've thought about, all the little ideas and details, things I only had time to think about, never implement. I then feed it to Claude, and watch it meet my every specification, I can then test it, note any bugs, recompile and re-test. I can review the code, as you would a Junior you're mentoring, and have it rewrite it in a specific pattern.Funnily enough, I love Beads, but did not like that it uses git hooks for the DB, and I can't tie tickets back to ticketing systems, so I've been building my own alternative, mine just syncs to and from github issues.

          "content": "> Checkpoints run as a Git-aware CLI. On every commit generated by an agent, it writes a structured checkpoint object and associates it with the commit SHA. The code stays exactly the same, we just add context as first-class metadata. When you push your commit, Checkpoints also pushes this metadata to a separate branch (entire/checkpoints/v1), giving you a complete, append-only audit log inside your repository. As a result, every change can now be traced back not only to a diff, but to the reasoning that produced it.The context for every single turn could in theory be nearly 1MB.  Since this context is being stored in the repo and constantly changing, after a thousand turns, won't it make just doing a \"git checkout\" start to be really heavy?For example, codex-cli stores every single context for a given session in a jsonl file (in .codex).  I've easily got that file to hit 4 GB in size, just working for a few days; amusingly, codex-cli would then take many GB of RAM at startup.   I ended up writing a script that trims the jsonl history automatically periodically.   The latest codex-cli has an optional sqlite store for context state.My guess is that by \"context\", Checkpoints doesn't actually mean the contents of the context window, but just distilled reasoning traces, which are more manageable... but still can be pretty large.",

But wouldn't trying to pull N checkpoints into context of the N+1 task be MUCH more expensive? It's at odds with the current practice of clearing context regularly to save on input tokens. Even subagents (which I think are the real superpower that Claude Code has over Gemini CLI for now) by their nature get spawned with fresh near-empty context.Token costs aside, arguably fresh context is also better at problem solving. When it was just me coding by hand, I didn't save all my intermediate thinking work anywhere: instead thinking afresh when a similar problem came up later helped in coming up with better solutions. I did occasionally save my thinking in design docs, but the equivalent to that is CLAUDE.md and similar human-reviewed markdown saved at explicit -umm- checkpoints.",

It might be an original technique I never heard anyone using it. A stickie note in the tool response, printed by a hook, that highlights the current task and where is the current task.md located. I have seen stretches of 10 or 15 minutes of good work done this way with no user intervention. Like a \"Markdown Turing Machine\".",

(\"loop over the outer product of lists of choices for each category\")- Implementation hints (\"use itertools.product() to iterate over the combinations\")- And, \"ask questions if you are uncertain\" helps trigger an iteration to quickly clarify something instead of fixing the resulting code.This specificity makes prompting a lot more work but it pays off.

Diminishing returns can be avoided by switching to more independent problems – like adding one-off features to GPUs – but these quickly hit their own diminishing returns.Literally everyone already knows the problems with scaling compute and data.

Now this is a solved problemI wish…Detecting text encoding is only easy if all you need to contend with is UTF16-with-BOM, UTF8-with-BOM, UTF8-without-BOM, and plain ASCII (which is effectively also UTF8). As soon as you might see UTF16 or UCS without a BOM, or 8-bit codepages other than plain ASCII (many apps/libs assume that these are always CP1252, a superset of the printable characters of ISO-8859-1, which may not be the case), things are not fully deterministic.Thankfully UTF8 has largely won out over the many 8-bit encodings, but that leaves the interesting case of UTF8-with-BOM. The standard recommends against using it, that plain UTF8 is the way to go, but to get Excel to correctly load a UTF8 encoded CSV or similar you must include the BOM (otherwise it assumes CP 1252 and characters above 127 are corrupted). But… some apps/libs are completely unaware that UTF8-with-BOM is a thing at all so they load such files with the first column header corrupted.Source: we have clients pushing & pulling (or having us push/pull) data back & forth in various CSV formats, and we see some oddities in what we receive and what we are expected to send more regularly than you might think. The real fun comes when something at the client's end processes text badly (multiple steps with more than one of them incorrectly reading UTF8 as CP1252, for example) before we get hold of it, and we have to convince them that what they have sent is non-deterministically corrupt and we can't reliably fix it on the receiving end…",

I rather suspect that would hasten it instead, but the runaway hot house thing is not supported by the historic record. Perhaps the collapse of the AMOC is what tips it.

Marine cloud brightening could produce meaningful planetary cooling for roughly $5 billion per year at scale (NAS estimate). That's like what? 1% of what was spent on AI infrastructure last year?The money exists. What doesn't exist is the political coordination to spend it.The goddamn Alameda city council shut down a University of Washington MCB field test in 2024 because nobody told them it was happening on their property. Go look it up.This's the actual bottleneck: governance, coordination, and political will, not capital.When someone says \"we should invest resources in X instead of Y,\" it's worth asking who \"we\" is and what mechanism they're proposing. AI investment is private capital chasing returns. You can't redirect it to climate by wishing. The implicit model, that Society has a budget and we're choosing wrong, assumes a resource allocation authority that doesn't exist. If you want to argue for creating one, that's a real position, but it should be stated openly rather than hidden inside \"it would be sensible.\"Also ... \"AI won't solve it; it only makes it worse\" is doing a ton of work! The energy consumption concern has real merit. But materials science, grid optimization, and climate modeling are direct climate contributions happening now. Google has saved energy in its datacenters ... using AI!Blanket dismissal of an entire domain of capability isn't seriousness, it's pattern matching.

It was a fairly well-accepted method of remote access. The heterogeneous network had many different modes, but a major dialup point was the Annex box, which supported telnet into the Unix or VMS machines.Between Unix machines, we would often prefer \"rlogin\" instead. There were several horrific iterations of other remote-access protocols such as \"remsh\". rlogin was notorious for its \"/etc/hosts.equiv\" authorization method which trusted DNS and should've been perceived as Swiss Cheese from the outset. rlogin was, IIRC, directly related to rsh and rcp and used the same frameworks. rlogin was no more secure than telnet, but probably less secure because of its conveniences.We also used port 23/tcp for remote management, for example Cisco routers. They weren't running telnetd, but it was the port where you connected remotely and logged in with or without credentials.rlogin persisted alongside telnet, until encryption came into fashion and ssh was distributed. Once ssh was available and working well, everyone knew that telnetd and rlogind were on borrowed time. The services were shut down and disabled in inetd. The ports were sometimes blocked. Security advisories went out.I suppose it took a long, long time for ssh to finally dominate, and for people to abandon telnetd mostly, but it was fairly thorough. We all recognized the superiority of sshd's authentication and encrypted channels.There were mitigations for people to extend their legacy use of telnetd and rlogind. For example, tcp wrappers and fail2ban could be implemented. Firewall filters could select only authorized networks. VPNs could tunnel through an Intranet that still used them. So, the services lived on wherever they didn't need to be exposed on the public Internet. But I think most Unix admins got the picture by the end of the dot-com bubble.",

Where are you getting this information?Most MUDs implement RFC 854, and a number of non-standard Telnet option subnegotiation protocols have been adopted for compression (MCCP2), transmission of unrendered data (ATCP, GMCP, ZMP), and even a mechanism for enabling marking up the normal content using XML-style tags (MXP). These telopts build on the subnegotiation facility in standard Telnet, whose designers knew that the base protocol would be insufficient for many needs; there are a great number of IANA-controlled and standardized telopt codes that demonstrate this, and the MUD community has developed extensions using that same mechanism.> You can usually connect to a MUD using a Telnet client, but most players hate the experience and often deride this method in favor of a dedicated, programmable client.I think you are confusing \"telnet\" the program with \"telnet\" the protocol. I am speaking here of the protocol, defined at base in RFC 854, for which \"telnet\" the program is but one particularly common implementation. You look at any of those \"dedicated, programmable clients\" and they will contain an implementation of RFC 854, probably also an implementation of RFC 1143 (which nails down the rules of subnegotiation in order to prevent negotiation loops), and an implementation of the RFCs for several standard telopts as well as non-standardized MUD community telopts. I can speak for the behavior of MUSHclient in especial regard here, though I am also familiar with the underlying Telnet nature of Mudlet, ZMud, and CMUD, not to mention my very own custom-made prototype client for which I very much needed to implement Telnet as described above.",

I wonder if the results would be comparable if we replace ehtics+KPIs by any comparable pair and create a pressure on the model.In practical real-life scenarios this study is very interesting and applicable! At the same time it is important to keep in mind that it anthropomorphizes the models that technically don't interpret the ethical constraints the same was as this is assumed by most readers.",

Ultimately \"judgement,\" however you wish to quantify that fuzzy concept, is not purely an optimization exercise. It's far more a probabilistic information function from incomplete or conflicting data.In product management (my domain), decisions are made under conflicting constraints: a big customer or account manager pushing hard, a CEO/board priority, tech debt, team capacity, reputational risk and market opportunity. PMs have tried with varied success to make decisions more transparent with scoring matrices and OKRs, but at some point someone has to make an imperfect judgment call that’s not reducible to a single metric. It's only defensible through narrative, which includes data.Also, progressive elaboration or iterations or build-measure-learn are inherently fuzzy. Reinertsen compared this to maximizing the value of an option. Maybe in modern terms a prediction market is a better metaphor. That's what we're doing in sprints, maximizing our ability to deliver value in short increments.I do get nervous about pushing agentic systems into roadmap planning, ticket writing, or KPI-driven execution loops. Once you collapse a messy web of tradeoffs into a single success signal, you’ve already lost a lot of the context.There’s a parallel here for development too. LLMs are strongest at greenfield generation and weakest at surgical edits and refactoring. Early-stage startups survive by iterative design and feedback. Automating that with agents hooked into web analytics may compound errors and adverse outcomes.So even if you strip out “ethics” and replace it with any pair of competing objectives, the failure mode remains.",

But I agree completely at being awful at decisions.I’ve been building a data-agent tool (similar to [1][2]). Gemini 3’s main failure cases are that it makes up metrics that really are not appropriate, and it will use inappropriate data and force it into a conclusion. When a task is clear + possible then it’s amazing. When a task is hard with multiple failure paths then you run into Gemini powering through to get an answer.Temperature seems to play a huge role in Gemini’s decision quality from what I see in my evals, so you can probably tune it to get better answers but I don’t have the recipe yet.Claude 4+ (Opus & Sonnet) family have been much more honest, but the short context windows really hurt on these analytical use cases, plus it can over-focus on minutia and needs to be course corrected.

Personally I think a bunch of companies are going to see their profit and stock price fall significantly, if an AI agent starts acting as a backstop for both unethical and illegal behavior. Even something as simple as preventing violation of internal policy could make a huge difference.To some extend I don't even thing that people realize that what they're doing is bad, because humans tend to be a bit fuzzy and can dream up reason as to why rules don't apply or wasn't meant for them, or this is a rather special situation.

      "abstract": "该讨论围绕复数本质结构的数学哲学争议展开。用户们主要探讨复数是否具有“基础性”地位，以及其定义方式是否自然。有人认为复数本质上是解决多项式方程的工具，其出现具有历史偶然性；也有用户指出，若将实数视为有序拓扑域，则复数是满足有限维可除代数条件的必然扩展，具有结构上的必然性。讨论中提到，部分用户倾向于将复数理解为线性变换或特定矩阵集合，强调其几何与代数双重性质。对于教学与应用，有用户反映将复数定义为实数闭包容易引发初学者的困惑，而物理和工程领域则更关注其作为计算工具的有效性。尽管观点多元，多数用户认同复数作为抽象数学工具的价值，但在其“根本性”是源于内在数学结构还是实用便利性这一问题上仍存在明显分歧。",

In particular, they arose historically as a tool for solving polynomial equations. Is this the shadow of something natural that we just couldn't see, or just a convenience?As the \"evidence\" piles up, in further mathematics, physics, and the interactions of the two, I still never got to the point at the core where I thought complex numbers were a certain fundamental concept, or just a convenient tool for expressing and calculating a variety of things. It's more than just a coincidence, for sure, but the philosophical part of my mind is not at ease with it.I doubt anyone could make a reply to this comment that would make me feel any better about it. Indeed, I believe real numbers to be completely natural, but far greater mathematicians than I found them objectionable only a hundred years ago, and demonstrated that mathematics is rich and nuanced even when you assume that they don't exist in the form we think of them today.",

          "content": "One way to sharpen the question is to stop asking whether C is \"fundamental\" and instead ask whether it is forced by mild structural constraints. From that angle, its status looks closer to inevitability than convenience.Take R as an ordered field with its usual topology and ask for a finite-dimensional, commutative, unital R-algebra that is algebraically closed and admits a compatible notion of differentiation with reasonable spectral behavior. You essentially land in C, up to isomorphism. This is not an accident, but a consequence of how algebraic closure, local analyticity, and linearization interact. Attempts to remain over R tend to externalize the complexity rather than eliminate it, for example by passing to real Jordan forms, doubling dimensions, or encoding rotations as special cases rather than generic elements.More telling is the rigidity of holomorphicity. The Cauchy-Riemann equations are not a decorative constraint; they encode the compatibility between the algebra structure and the underlying real geometry. The result is that analyticity becomes a global condition rather than a local one, with consequences like identity theorems and strong maximum principles that have no honest analogue over R.I’m also skeptical of treating the reals as categorically more natural. R is already a completion, already non-algebraic, already defined via exclusion of infinitesimals. In practice, many constructions over R that are taken to be primitive become functorial or even canonical only after base change to C.So while one can certainly regard C as a technical device, it behaves like a fixed point: impose enough regularity, closure, and stability requirements, and the theory reconstructs it whether you intend to or not. That does not make it metaphysically fundamental, but it does make it mathematically hard to avoid without paying a real structural cost.",

It seemed kind of suspect that you'd reduce the complex numbers purely to its field properties of addition and multiplication when these aren't enough to get from the rationals to the reals (some limit-like construction is needed; the article uses Dedekind cuts later on). Anyway, the \"algebraic conception\" is defined as \"up to isomorphism, the unique algebraically closed field of characteristic zero and size continuum\", that is, you just declare it has the same size as the reals. And of course now you have no way to tell where π is, since it has no algebraic relation to the distinguished numbers 0 and 1. If I'm reading right, this can be done with any uncountable cardinality with uniqueness up to isomorphism. It's interesting that algebraic closure is enough to get you this far, but with the arbitrary choice of cardinality and all these \"wild automorphisms\", doesn't this construction just seem... defective?It feels a bit like the article's trying to extend some legitimate debate about whether fixing i versus -i is natural to push this other definition as an equal contender, but there's hardly any support offered.

Transcendental numbers are all automorphic with each other; the structure cannot distinguish e from π.

With other free variables, because the field's algebraically closed, you can fix π to whatever transcendental you like and still solve for the remaining variables. So it's something like, the rationals plus a continuum's worth of arbitrary field extensions? Not terribly surprising that all instances of this are isomorphic as fields but it's starting to feel about as useful as claiming the real numbers are \"up to set isomorphism, the unique set whose cardinality matches the power set of the natural numbers\", like, of course it's got automorphisms, you didn't finish defining it.",

No one ever saw \"two\", for example.Another thing to think about is the very nature of mathematical existence. In a certain perspective, no objects cannot exist in math. If you can think if an object with certain rules constraining it, voila, it exists, independent of whether a certain rule system prohibit its. All that matters is that we adhere to the rule system we have imagined into being. It does not exist in a certain mathematical axiomatic system, but then again axioms are by their very nature chosen.Now in that vein here is a deep thought: I think free will exists just because we can imagine a math object into being that is neither caused nor random.

The outcome is deterministically constraint by your preferences but ultimately a random choice within those constraints. But is that what you think of as free will?

Ditto the other stuff: If I'm going to do contour integrals then I've implied some things about metric and handedness.I still don't see how this really puts mathematicians in \"disagreement.\" Let's pedestrian example:I usually make an x,y plot with the x-axis pointing to the right and the y-axis pointing away from me. If I put a z-axis, personally I'll make it upwards out of the paper (sometimes this matters). Usually, but not always, my co-ordinates are meant to be smooth. But if somebody does some of this another way, are they really disagreeing with me? I think \"no.\" If we're talking about the same problem, we'll eventually get the same answer (after we each fix 3 or 4 mistakes). If we're talking about different problems, then we need our answers to potentially \"disagree.\"",

If the recipient is not available it will be handed over to a neighbour and this will be noted on a little card that's placed in the recipient's mail box. If that is not possible it will be taken back to the mail office and the recipient can pick it up in person.Adding video surveillance is no solution.

In the meantime, I appreciate that they're building largely in the open - every once in a while I'll glance at their issue tracker for light bedtime reading. Just recently we had some fun internally throwing our controls software at their thermal loop as a usage example - it's often hard to find compelling real-world systems to use as openly sharable examples (of course we have interesting customer problems, but that's all NDA'd), so having companies build real stuff in the open is fantastic.

If I'm putting in low core density slow machines I've got to do a lot more management than if I'm using my Epyc 9755 based servers. This is a practical constraint not just a theoretical \"oh I want the latest and greatest\". It's just that I can't really justify using up 4U and a kW on an Epyc 7003 series. The compute density just isn't there for the power use. The old chips are practically deadweight.Anyway, I'm glad to hear of the raise because the team seems exceptional (judging by the posts you guys write and they have written prior to the company) and I love work in this area that simplifies hardware management.

I ask because those are found in most engineering companies as far as I know (that do serious numerical work) as well as labs or universities (that can't afford the engineers and technicians companies can).Also, what is the meaning of calling an on-prem machine \"cloud\" anymore? I thought the whole point of the cloud was that the hardware had been abstracted (and moved) away and you just got resources on demand over the network. Basically I don't understand what they're selling if it's not what people already call clusters. And then if the machine is designed, set up and maintained by a third party, why even go through the hassle of hosting it physically, and not rent out the compute?",

          "content": "\"k-id, the age verification provider discord uses doesn't store or send your face to the server. instead, it sends a bunch of metadata about your face and general process details.\"I think the primary issue is not the \"send your face\" (face info) to a server. The problem is that private entities are greedy for user data, in this case tying facial recognition to activities related to interacting with other people, most of them probably real people. So this creates a huge database - it is no surprise that greedy state actors and private companies want that data. You can use it for many things, including targeted ads.For me the \"must verify\" is clearly a lie. They can make it \"sound logical\" but that does not convince me in the slightest. Back in the age of IRC (I started with mIRC in the 1990s, when I was using windows still), the thought of requiring others to show their faces never occurred to me at all. There were eventually video-related formats but to me it felt largely unnecessary for the most part. Discord is (again to me) nothing but a fancier IRC variant that is controlled by a private (and evidently greedy) actor.So while it is good to have the information how to bypass anything there, my biggest gripe is that people should not think about it in this way. Meaning, bypassing is not what I would do in this case; I would simply abandon the private platform altogether. People made Discord big; people should make Discord small again if they sniff after them.",

          "content": "Well, it’s a clever idea. Discord seems to have intentionally softened its age-verification steps so it can tell regulators, “we’re doing something to protect children,” while still leaving enough wiggle room that technically savvy users can work around it.But in practice, this only holds if regulators are either inattentive or satisfied with checkbox compliance. If a government is competent and motivated, this approach won’t hold up—and it may even antagonize regulators by looking like bad-faith compliance.I’ve also heard that some governments are already pushing for much stricter age-verification protocols, precisely because people can bypass weaker checks—for example, by using a webcam with partial face covering to confuse ID/face matching. I can’t name specific vendors, but some providers are responding by deploying stronger liveness checks that are significantly harder to game. And many services are moving age verification into mobile apps, where simple JavaScript-based tricks are less likely to work.",

But the privacy-preserving design (run the model locally, only send metadata) is exactly what makes it trivially spoofable. The encryption is solid (AES-GCM with HKDF-derived keys) but it protects transport integrity, not input authenticity.So they moved away from collecting IDs because collecting IDs is a liability, and moved toward a system that's bypassable because it doesn't collect enough to verify. This isn't solvable without hardware attestation (App Attest, Play Integrity), which kills the browser flow and still doesn't prevent pointing the camera at a screen.Age verification as a concept requires either trusting the client (spoofable), collecting sensitive data (breach liability), or binding to attested hardware (excludes platforms and users).

One reason for the incredible esteem that Korean culture is held in within Asia is the Korean government's active support of its filmmaking, TV and music industry. This was also true in Renaissance Italy (courtesy of the Medici family) and in 17th Century France (courtesy of Louis XIV). It was even true of the CIA's active support of abstract expressionism.

The program was stopped in 2010, meaning no new recipients have been selected since. As far as I know, there's been no studies surrounding any measurable increase in artistic quality or artistic output.It is of course easy to point out how deeply unfair such programs are on multiple levels. Unsurprisingly, many recipients have utilized loopholes in order to receive the grant despite having incomes and wealth well above the threshold.Edit to clarify: Sweden still grants long-term stipends to various artists, sometimes up to a decade.

          "content": "It's not universal if only selected individuals get it. And you can't live on 325 euros in a place like Ireland. So it's not even basic income. But it's a nice temporary subsidy.Proper basic income has never really been tried. It would have to be universal (for the entire population) and be enough to live on.Most countries have non universal basic income in the form of benefits, state pensions, food stamps, and various social security insurance programs. One way or another people that can't or won't work still get enough to survive. Mostly, countries don't let their citizens starve. They mostly don't put them out on the streets. And if people get sick, generally hospitals/doctors will help. You won't necessarily get a very nice version of all that in most countries.If you think of basic income like that, UBI is actually not that much of a departure from that status quo. It just establishes that as a bare minimum that everybody gets one way or another. The reason that the idea gets a lot of push back is that people have a lot of morals about having to earn stuff which then results in complex rules to qualify for things only if you are unable to earn a living. Which then turns into a lot of complex schemes to establish non universal income that comes into a variety of forms and shapes. But it adds up to the same result: everybody is taken care off.A proper UBI would have to award it to anyone. That's what universal means. It would be a simplification of what we have now. If you are employed, you would get a chunk of income from UBI and the rest from your employer. Basically, you work to add income on top of your UBI and it's between you and your employer to sort out how much you work and how much you earn. If you get unemployed, you fall back to UBI. UBI would be untaxed. But if you work or earn income you pay taxes. Company earnings are taxed as well. And you pay VAT when you buy stuff. Those revenue streams are what already fund things today.People think of UBI as extra cost but it could actually be a cost saving if done properly. There's a lot of bureaucracy that's no longer needed. You could still layer insurances and benefits on top of course. But that would be more optional. And you could incentivize people to work that are currently actively incentivized to not work (e.g. to not lose benefits or get penalized on their pensions).People forget that the status quo is not free either and that it requires an enormous, convoluted bureaucracy that also costs money. UBI could end up being simpler and cheaper.The hard part with UBI is balancing fairness and financial viability and implementing it in a way that isn't massively disruptive and complicated. You'd need to incentivize most people to still want to work while making the system generous enough that people can opt not to. That's not a solved problem and the key show stopper. Many people that work object against anyone getting anything for free. But if you consider the status quo, we already have a lot of people not working anyway. And we all pay for that already. That is actually a rather large percentage of people that are allowed to vote in many countries.Mostly the moral arguments against UBI are what perpetuates the very inefficient and costly status quo. We just keep on making that harsher, more complicated, and more expensive. Effectively if you work, you are paying extra for all that inefficiency. Worse, you can work your ass off your whole life and still have to worry about having enough to retire, the affordability of housing, or being able to afford essential health care.",

I would suppose the 8,000 needed to meet qualifications first.Ireland promises €325/week. The NEA grants seem to be on a project basis.So neither of these programs are anything like UBI. UBI is the buzzword that sets us all atwitter with eager hopefulness and aspirations.Artist grant programs are more like \"publish or perish\" research scholars. Most grant recipients view the application process as daunting and stressful, especially when it's not in their wheelhouse. \"Grant writer\" is a job title and a profession unto itself these days. Even charities and welfare organizations depend on grants themselves, so their recipients may be cut off if the grants don't come in on time and fill their budgets.Ireland's program is like being on the dole. \"Here's enough to subsist on while you do your art and try to establish yourself.\" After 3 years, they're cut off for 3 years, so the incentive exists to become self-sufficient in that time.Subsidizing the arts has been the realm of religion, including Christianity, for thousands of years. Michelangelo and Bernini were among thousands and thousands of artists who were funded by the Church to create music, sculpture, architecture, images, and any other sacred object in their service. If socialism or communism are the first thing to spring to your mind, please rethink and consider that these philosophies sought to supplant the original collectives: religions; and the religious leaders and patrons were distributing wealth to every possible artisan and artist and composer and performer, in the service of truth, beauty, and goodness. Nobody knows the pain of shrinking churches like Ireland does, and so it really is incumbent on their secular government to pick up the tab here, lest the hands of artists become idle and restless.",

          "content": "Milton Friedman wouldn’t have approved of a basic-income scheme restricted to artists. He would have argued that restricting the benefit to artists would distort incentives for choosing a profession in a way likely to reduce social welfare, and that eligibility by profession is a “welfare trap”: it’s hard to stop being an artist and start being something else when it means losing your guaranteed income.But Friedman would have supported a broad basic-income scheme. We know this because he did support one. It was his proposal in 1962 of a “negative income tax” [0] (in Capitalism and Freedom) that gave rise to the movement to replace traditional social welfare programs with simple schemes that just give money to poor people. (This movement led to the Earned Income Tax Credit [1] in the United States.)Friedman’s negative income tax is equivalent to the contemporary notion of a guaranteed basic income (but not to a universal basic income, as only people earning below some threshold would receive it). Like most economists, Friedman believed that people (even poor people) can typically make their own economic choices better than a government program can make those choices for them. (He was likewise not opposed to redistributive policies per se.) That was the root of his advocacy for market-based mechanisms of organizing the economy.0. The idea dates to at least the 1940’s, but Friedman’s book is typically credited with popularizing it. See, e.g,  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Negative_income_tax.1. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earned_income_tax_credit",

          "content": "The author is correct in that agents are becoming more and more capable and that you don't need the IDE to the same extent, but I don't see that as good. I find that IDE-based agentic programming actually encourages you to read and understand your codebase as opposed to CLI-based workflows. It's so much easier to flip through files, review the changes it made, or highlight a specific function and give it to the agent, as opposed to through the CLI where you usually just give it an entire file by typing the name, and often you just pray that it manages to find the context by itself. My prompts in Cursor are generally a lot more specific and I get more surgical results than with Claude Code in the terminal purely because of the convenience of the UX.But secondly, there's an entire field of LLM-assisted coding that's being almost entirely neglected and that's code autocomplete models. Fundamentally they're the same technology as agents and should be doing the same thing: indexing your code in the background, filtering the context, etc, but there's much less attention and it does feel like the models are stagnating.I find that very unfortunate. Compare the two workflows:With a normal coding agent, you write your prompt, then you have to at least a full minute for the result (generally more, depending on the task), breaking your flow and forcing you to task-switch. Then it gives you a giant mass of code and of course 99% of the time you just approve and test it because it's a slog to read through what it did. If it doesn't work as intended, you get angry at the model, retry your prompt, spending a larger amount of tokens the longer your chat history.But with LLM-powered auto-complete, when you want, say, a function to do X, you write your comment describing it first, just like you should if you were writing it yourself. You instantly see a small section of code and if it's not what you want, you can alter your comment. Even if it's not 100% correct, multi-line autocomplete is great because you approve it line by line and can stop when it gets to the incorrect parts, and you're not forced to task switch and you don't lose your concentration, that great sense of \"flow\".Fundamentally it's not that different from agentic coding - except instead of prompting in a chatbox, you write comments in the files directly. But I much prefer the quick feedback loop, the ability to ignore outputs you don't want, and the fact that I don't feel like I'm losing track of what my code is doing.",

There's several reasons for this. 1) a smaller model doesn't have as good deep reasoning, so it works okay for a simple ask. 2) small context, small task, small model can produce better results than big context, big task, big model. The lost-in-the-middle problem is still unsolved, leading to mistakes that get worse with big context, and longer runs exacerbate issues. So small context/task that ends and starts a new loop (with planning & learning) ends up working really well and quickly.There's a difference between tasks and problem-solving, though.

If the OP here is 1. a programmer 2. who works solely with other programmers and 3. who is \"on the grind\", mostly just consuming non-fiction blog-post content related to software development these days, rather than paying much attention to what's currently happening to the world of movies/music/literature/etc... then it'd be pretty easy for them to not be exposed very much to anti-LLM sentiment, since that sentiment is entirely occurring in these other fields that might have no relevance to their (professional or personal) life.\"Anti-LLM sentiment\" within software development is nearly non-existent. The biggest kind of push-back to LLMs that we see on HN and elsewhere, is effectively just pragmatic skepticism around the effectiveness/utility/ROI of LLMs when employed for specific use-cases. Which isn't \"anti-LLM sentiment\" any more than skepticism around the ability of junior programmers to complete complex projects is \"anti-junior-programmer sentiment.\"The difference between the perspectives you find in the creative professions vs in software dev, don't come down to \"not getting\" or \"not understanding\"; they really are a question of relative exposure to these pro-LLM vs anti-LLM ideas. Software dev and the creative professions are acting as entirely separate filter-bubbles of conversation here. You can end up entirely on the outside of one or the other of them by accident, and so end up entirely without exposure to one or the other set of ideas/beliefs/memes.(If you're curious, my own SO actually has this filter-bubble effect from the opposite end, so I can describe what that looks like. She only hears the negative sentiment coming from the creatives she follows, while also having to dodge endless AI slop flooding all the marketplaces and recommendation feeds she previously used to discover new media to consume. And her job is one you do with your hands and specialized domain knowledge; so none of her coworkers use AI for literally anything. [Industry magazines in her field say \"AI is revolutionizing her industry\" — but they mean ML, not generative AI.] She has no questions that ChatGPT could answer for her.

          "content": "I’m seeing it slightly differently. So much of our new slowdown is rework because we’ve seen a bunch more API and contract churn. The project I’m on has had more rework than I care to contemplate and most of it stems from everyone’s coding agents failing to stay synced up with each other on the details and their human handlers not noticing the discrepancies until we’re well into systems integration work.If I may hijack your analogy, it would be like if all the construction crews got really fast at their work,  so much so that the city decided to go for an “iterative construction” strategy because, in isolation, the cost of one team trying different designs on-site until they hit on one they liked became very small compared to the cost of getting city planners and civil engineers involved up-front. But what wasn’t considered was the rework multiplier effect that comes into play when the people building the water, sewage, electricity, telephones, roads, etc. are all repeatedly tweaking designs with minimal coordination amongst each other. So then those tweaks keep inducing additional design tweaks and rework on adjacent contractors because none of these design changes happen in a vacuum. Next thing you know all the houses are built but now need to be rewired because the electricity panel is designed for a different mains voltage from the drop and also it’s in the wrong part of the house because of a late change from overhead lines in the alleys to underground lines below the street.Many have observed that coding agents lack object permanence so keeping them on a coherent plan requires giving them such a thoroughly documented plan up front. It actually has me wondering if optimal coding agent usage at scale resembles something of a return to waterfall (probably in more of a Royce sense than the bogeyman agile evangelists derived from the original idea) where the humans on the team mostly spend their time banging out systems specifications and testing protocols, and iteration on the spec becomes somewhat more removed from implementing it than it is in typical practice nowadays.",

          "content": "Facebook's algorithm has picked up on the idea that \"I like art\". It has subsequently given me more examples of (human-created) art in my feed. Art from comic book artists, art from manga-style creators, \"weird art\", even a make-up artist who painted a scene from Where the Wild Things Are on her face.I like this. What's more, while AI-generated art has a characteristic sameyness to it, the human-produced art stands out in its originality. It has character and soul. Even if it's bad! AI slop has made the human-created stuff seem even more striking by comparison. The market for human art isn't going anywhere, just like the audience for human-played chess went nowhere after Deep Blue. I think people will pay a premium for it, just to distinguish themselves from the slop. The same is true of writing and especially music. I know of no one who likes listening to AI-generated music. Even Sabrina Carpenter would raise less objection.The same, I'm afraid, cannot be said for software—because there is little value for human expression in the code itself. Code is—almost entirely—strictly utilitarian. So we are now at an inflection point where LLMs can generate and validate code that's nearly as good, if not better, than what we can produce on our own. And to not make use of them is about as silly as Mel Kaye still punching in instruction opcodes in hex into the RPC-4000, while his colleagues make use of these fancy new things called \"compilers\". They're off building unimaginably more complex software than they could before, but hey, he gets his pick of locations on the rotating memory drum!I'm one of the nonexistent anti-LLMers when it comes to software. I hate talking to a clanker, whose training data set I don't even have access to let alone the ability to understand how my input affects its output, just to do what I do normally with the neural net I've carried around in my skull and trained extensively for this very purpose. I like working directly with code. Code is not just a product for me; it is a medium of thought and expression. It is a formalized notation of a process that I can use to understand and shape that process.But with the right agentic loops, LLMs can just do more, faster. There's really no point in resisting. The marginal value of what I do has just dropped to zero.",

          "content": ">\"Anti-LLM sentiment\" within software development is nearly non-existentThis is certainly untrue. I want to say \"obviously\", which means that maybe I am misunderstanding you. Below are some examples of negative sentiments programmers have - can you explain why you are not counting these?NOTE: I am not presenting these as an \"LLMs are bad\" argument. My own feelings go both ways. There is a lot that's great about LLMs, and I don't necessarily agree with every word I've written below - some of it is just my paraphrasing of what other people say. I'm only listing examples of what drives existing anti-LLM sentiment in programmers.1. Job loss, loss of income, or threat thereofThese two are exacerbated by the pace of change, since so many people already spent their lives and money establishing themselves in the career and can't realistically pivot without becoming miserable - this is the same story for every large, fast change - though arguably this one is very large and very fast even by those standards. Lots of tech leadership is focusing even more than they already were on cheap contractors, and/or pushing employees for unrealistic productivity increases. I.e. it's exacerbating the \"fast > good\" problem, and a lot of leadership is also overestimating how far it reduces the barrier to creating things, as opposed to mostly just speeding up a person's existing capabilities. Some leadership is also using the apparent loss of job security as leverage beyond salary suppression (even less proportion of remote work allowed, more surveillance, worse office conditions, etc).2. Happiness loss (in regards to the job itself, not all the other stuff in this list)This is regarding people who enjoy writing/designing programs but don't enjoy directing LLMs; or who don't enjoy debugging the types of mistakes LLMs tend to make, as opposed to the types of mistakes that human devs tend to make. For these people, it's like their job was forcibly changed to a different, almost unrelated job, which can be miserable depending on why you were good at - or why you enjoyed - the old job.3. Uncertainty/skepticismI'm pushing back on your dismissal of this one as \"not anti-LLM sentiment\" - the comparison doesn't make sense. If I was forced to only review junior dev code instead of ever writing my own code or reviewing experienced dev code, I would be unhappy. And I love teaching juniors! And even if we ignore the subset of cases where it doesn't do a good job or assume it will soon be senior-level for every use case, this still overlaps with the above problem: The mistakes it makes are not like the mistakes a human makes. For some people, it's more unnatural/stressful to keep your eyes peeled for the kinds of mistakes it makes. For these people, it's a shift away from objective, detail-oriented, controlled, concrete thinking; away from the feeling of making something with your hands; and toward a more wishy-washy creation experience that can create a feeling of lack of control.4. Expertise lossA lot of positive outcomes with LLMs come from being already experienced. Some argue this will be eroded - both for new devs and existing experienced devs.5.

The number of leaking extensions should not be taken as definite.There are resource constrains. Those extensions try to actively detect if you are in developer mode. Took us a while to avoid such measures and we are certain we missed many extensions due to for example usage of Docker container. Ideally you want to use env as close to the real one as possible.Without infrastructure this doesn't scale.The same goes for the code analysis you have proposed. There are already tools that do that (see Secure Annex). Often the extensions download remote code that is responsible for data exfiltration or the code is obfuscated multiple times. Ideally you want to run the extension in browser and inspect its code during execution.",

The latter is wildly more productive than the former. If you owned a business that employed a bunch of cobblers, then moving them all out of their little shops into one big factory where they can produce 100x as many shoes means you just got yourself 100x richer.But for an individual cobbler, you basically got fired at one job and hired at another. This may come as a surprise to those who view work as simply an abstract concept that produces value units, but people actually have preferences about how they spend their time. If you're a cobbler, you might enjoy your little workshop, slicing off the edge of leather around the heel, hammering in the pegs, sitting at your workbench.The nature of the work and your enjoyment of it is a fundamental part of the compensation package of a job.You might not want to quit that job and get a different job running a shoe assembly line in a factory. Now, if the boss said \"hey, since you're all going to be so much more productive working in the factory, we'll give you all 10x raises\" then perhaps you might be more excited about putting down your hammer. But the boss isn't saying that. He's saying \"all of the cobblers at the other companies are doing this to, so where are you gonna go?\".Of course AI is a top-down mandate.

As it currently exists, AI adoption is a bottom-up decision at the individual level, not a total corporate reorganization. Continuing your analogy, it's more akin to letting craftspeople bring whatever tools they want to work, whether those be hand tools or power tools.

          "content": "I feel like the lag-time of communication was an important component of older forms of communication that has been lost. That's not to say that fast communication isn't a boon to society, of course. Only that slower communication gives you more flexibility in how you respond, and more time to think about what your response should be.When the main form of long distance communication was the postal system, and letters took days to travel from sender to receiver, you could easily wait days, if not weeks, to draft up your reply and mail it out. The recipient on the other end wouldn't even be able to discern the difference between your delay and the delay from the postal network itself. It had some in-built slack.When the only phones were landlines, if someone called you and you knew you were in a bad mood, the kind of bad mood that would invariably make you say something stupid, you could just not pick up! There were plenty of common, understandable reasons someone wouldn't be available to answer their landline. Then they could leave you a message, and you could call back when you mood improved again. Again, there was slack built into the system.Now there's this cultural expectation that puts far more attention on your reaction speed. A text message with no immediate response could just be them not seeing it immediately... But actually no! Now we have read receipts too! You can't even pretend to have not seen it yet while you think of your reply. Some platforms even have the little \"currently typing\" indicator tell them how long you've spent drafting and re-drafting whatever message you ended up sending. A panopticon of communication. Now there's no slack. Any person anywhere in the world could try and get a hold of you with the same expectation of immediacy that a face-to-face conversation would supply.Now of course, not every single person I might text, call, or send an email to, will have the same expectations for what is an appropriate degree of responsiveness. But, (speaking from my personal experience) I am absolutely miserable at reading that from social clues. I am left having to assume that, in the absence of some clear indicator to the contrary, whoever I am writing to will actually have rather strict expectations, and that allowing myself to be lax may very well give them a terrible opinion of me. (Though, the degree to which their opinion of me actually matters is a different question entirely!)",

          "content": "This may be more of a \"me problem\" than a \"them problem\".I often have the experience that people apologize for being slow to respond to me. Whether they're on the phone, at a counter in person, or whatever. Sometimes they say \"oh dear, this computer is so slow today!\" or \"please bear with me while I check this...\" but many times it is a very pointed and pre-emptive statement that they cannot respond or comply with my request immediately, that it may take X number of hours or days or something.I made a special request to a vendor last year, and the CSR said \"oh gosh, we need to reach out to the manufacturer, in Europe, and you know how supply chains are these days... and...\" and I literally said \"no problem\" and eventually, they did not even charge me for the item when it came in, months later. Likewise the dry cleaner always seems to protest that they cannot finish in time and can we please push back the deadline, but I feel like they are trying to shirk my business because they're overwhelmed, too.And I've come to believe that this is mostly the result of me approaching with impatience and anxiety. I often reach a desk while breathless and make my requests more like demands with the utmost of urgency. I am not, in fact, that impatient, but I give that impression and people believe that I would be disappointed if they take too long. But I do tend to interrupt and distract people if they are trying to collect their thoughts, or figure something out.My last supervisor used to do this all the time. Practically every email and every voicemail was followed up with apology for being slow. And I really think that he was very gently telling me not to be so impatient and anxious.But also, there really is a business standard for prompt replies. If someone goes out-of-office, they are usually expected to put up an \"OOO autoreply\" that will tell you when they're returning. Because it really is business etiquette to respond promptly, or reset expectations by explain why you'll be late.",

I'm not sure if it's still true, but at the time, Outlook didn't use threaded view mode by default and most people didn't know about it.

And once the mechanism is dead, no matter how clean and whole it is, no matter how much you try to warm it up, blow on it—if the spiral spring is missing—the man is gone.Yet I can do something to live longer. Thoughts have a definite length. I can unwind them very fast—then the end comes quickly, or I may unwind them slowly, and the end will come more slowly. When we live as we do we think mechanically and quite unnecessarily. We very seldom think when necessary. So we could be much more economical.The secret is very simple. If any man really succeeds in understanding and learning to spend only as much as is necessary he will be able to economize a great deal of energy.Now look inwards at your thinking. You will see that you think all the time, associations flow on unceasingly. Now if you begin to think intentionally, you will find that you think very slowly, whereas when thoughts run on by themselves they flow very fast.Compare the two states: one, when our thoughts flow fast and the other when they flow slowly. For example, we are impatiently waiting for someone. We are all the time occupied with the thought—when will the person we are waiting for come? What happened to him, why isn’t he here? Has he had an accident? It seems to us we have been waiting an hour at least. We look at the watch and find it has been only five minutes.Another example. You sit in a comfortable chair. You are resting, nothing worries you. For the moment you do not want to think of anything important. Your thoughts flow slowly. It seems to you that you have been sitting thus for five minutes, whereas you sat for a whole hour.Time is our thoughts. We can measure time by our thinking. If we spend many thoughts, time seems long to us. If we spend few thoughts—time seems short. Time stands in direct ratio to the flow of associations.Just as in the thinking center, associations go on in other centers also.\nThe secret of prolonging life depends on the ability to spend the energy of our centers slowly and only intentionally. Learn to think consciously. This produces economy in the expenditure of energy. Don’t dream.Gurdjieff's Early Talks 1914-1931",

I find it re-assuring that judges get different answers under different scenarios, because it means they are listening and making judgment calls. If LLMs give only one answer, no matter what nuances are at play,  that sounds like they are failing to judge and instead are diminishing the thought process down to black-and-white thinking.Digging a bit deeper, the actual paper seems to agree: \"For the sake of consistency, we define an “error” in the same way that Klerman and Spamann do in their original paper: a departure from the law. Such departures, however, may not always reflect true lawlessness. In particular, when the applicable doctrine is a standard, judges may be exercising the discretion the standard affords to reach a decision different from what a surface-level reading of the doctrine would suggest\"",

The AI got the “right” answer every time, but I am curious to know if it ever grappled with the uncertainty.  This is the trouble with the concept of AI judging: in almost any case, you are going to stumble across one fact or another that’s not in the textbooks or an unsettled question of law.  Even the simplest slip-and-falls can throw weird curveballs.  Perhaps a sufficiently advanced AI can reason from first principles about how to understand these new situations or extend existing law to meet them.  But in such a case there is no “right” answer, and certainly not a verifiable answer for the AI to sniff out.  At least at the federal level, judicial power is only vested in people nominated by the president and confirmed by the Senate - in other words, by people who are chosen by, and answer to, the people’s elected representatives.  Often, unappointed magistrates and special masters will come in to help deal with simpler issues, and perhaps in time AI systems will be able to pick up some of this slack.  But when the law needs to evolve or change, we cannot put judicial power in the hands of an unappointed and unaccountable piece of software.",

The lay judges are people without legal training that effective function like a \"mini jury\", but unlike in a jury trial the lay judges deliberate with the professional judges.The professional judges in this system has the power to override if the lay judges are blatantly ignoring the law, but this is generally considered a last resort. That power requires the lay judges to justify themselves if they intend on making a call the professional judges disagree with. Despite that, it is not unusual for the lay judges to come to a judgement that is different from what the professional judges do, and fairly rare for their choices to be overridden.The end result is somewhere in the middle between a jury and \"just\" a judge.

In some cases it's still problematic but this is generally more manageable.The other stuff, the ones that are using every User-Agent under the sun and a zillion datacenter IPs and residential IPs and rotate their requests constantly so all your naive and formerly-ok rate-based blocking is useless... that stuff is definitely being tagged as \"for AI\" on the basis of circumstantial evidence. But from the timing of when it seemed to start, the amount of traffic and addresses, I don't have any problem guessing with pretty high confidence that this is AI. To your question of \"who are the customers\"... who's got all the money in the world sloshing around at their fingertips and could use a whole bunch of scraped pages about ~everything? Call it lazy reasoning if you'd like.How much this traces back ultimately to the big familiar brand names vs. would-be upstarts, I don't know.

Anything that can be abused for DOS purposes might get abused for exactly that. If you don't like that, don't run stuff on public servers or protect them properly. Yes this is annoying and not necessarily easy. Cloud based services exist that take some of that pain away.Logs filling up with 404, 401, or 400 responses should not kill your server.

For this you need to generate traffic and measure for instance RSSI or CSI (basically, signal strength) of the packets. If you increase frequency you can detect smaller movements such as arms moving vs. a body, or exclude pets if you reduce sensitivity. It works well for detecting presence and movement in a defined space, but ideally requires you to cross the path between two mains-powered devices, such as light bulbs or wifi mesh points. Passing a cafe doesn't seem too likely.If you want to do advanced sensing, trying to identify a person, I would postulate you need to saturate a space with high frequency wifi traffic, ideally placed mesh points, and let the algo train on identifying people first by a certain signature (combination of size/weight, movement/gait, breath / chest movements).Source: I worked on such technologies while at Signify (variants of this power Philips/Wiz \"SpaceSense\" feature).More here: https://www.theverge.com/2022/9/16/23355255/signify-wiz-spac...",

RSSI is an aggregation of information that the researchers describe as \"not robust\" for fine-grained tasks\nIn contrast, BFI is a high-resolution, compressed representation of signal characteristics.\nThis rich data allows the system to distinguish between 197 different individuals with 99.5% accuracy, something impossible with basic RSSI.While older CSI methods often focused on walking directly between a specific transmitter and receiver (Line-of-Sight), BFI allows a single malicious node to capture \"every perspective\" between the router and all its legitimate clients.Also CSI requires specialized hardware and custom firmware, this one isn't, just wifi module in monitor mode.",

Sad I can never find it. E Band isn't much better.IIRC the 60GHz radio is being left out of a lot of 5G deployments because the slight benefits don't outweigh the cost.This is a pretty common thing for mmWave (or near mmWave) to be deployed with massive fanfare and then be slowly phased out of existence. I am decidedly not writing this on a WiGig docking station.I dont see telcos wanting to constantly broadcast extra mmWave for little to no added benefit, especially not in all directions. Likewise, regulators are going to choke on that. And the class/band license schemes would have to be updated, to remove interference from devices already using those bands as they are about to have a constant background level of interference. E-Band PTP users, of which there are many, wont give up their high capacity links to weird 6G omni broadcasts without a fight.I tell you what however, having a button you can press that would map the environment for alignment sounds like a maybe use case here.

I'd say the most difficult part is to find a target that can actually deliver some value. Moltbook largely solved this problem, because these agents are relatively likely to have access to valuable things, and now you can hit many of them, at the same time.I won't even go into how wasteful this whole, social media for agents, thing is.In general, bots writing each other on mock reddit, isn't something the loose sleep over.

The only evidence for the title appears to be a link to this tweet https://x.com/HumanHarlan/status/2017424289633603850  It doesn't tell us about most posts on Moltbook.  There's little reason to believe Technology Review did an independent investigation.If you read this piece closely, it becomes apparent that it is essentially a PR puff piece.  Most of the supporting evidence is quotes from various people working at AI agent companies, explaining that AI agents are not something we need to worry about.  Of course, cigarette companies told us we didn't need to worry about cigarettes either.My view is that this entire discussion around \"pattern-matching\", \"mimicking\", \"emergence\", \"hallucination\", etc. is essentially a red herring.  If I \"mimic\" a racecar driver, \"hallucinate\" a racetrack, and \"pattern-match\" to an actual race by flooring the gas on my car and zooming along at 200mph... the outcome will still be the same if my vehicle crashes.For these AIs, the \"motivation\" or \"intent\" doesn't matter.  They can engage in a roleplay and it can still cause a catastrophe.  They're just picking the next token... but the roleplay will affect which token gets picked.  Given their ability to call external tools etc., this could be a very big problem.",

I'm sure given the pace of change and the perception that this is history-changing is impacting peoples' judgment. The unusual focus on their opinions can't be helping either.

After hearing about it he went to a demonstration involving a big volvo engine funded by the navy.After 10 min he climbed onto stage pointed at some electronics plugged into the wall, he pulled the plug and playfully dangled it above papp who protested loudly and said it was not safe. Feynman ignored him until papp went into full panic. The plug was returned, papp put it back into the wall and the engine exploded. 7 people were injured, one lost a leg and one audience member died.The dubious thing to me was that  after much media exposure no one was interested in the physics.Feynman oddly twists the story and said papp unplugged it and gave the plug to him. He wanted to hold it he said.He also created a fantastic imaginary forensic report where he imagined papp put explosives in the engine.After papp blamed him for destroying the engine they settled out of court.The noble gas engine was now officially debunked.https://hoaxes.org/comments/papparticle2.htmlIt gets more absurd where journalists and internet septics make an effort to change the story.https://skeptics.stackexchange.com/questions/28530/did-richa...I generously give the Papp engine 0.1% odds of being useful technology which means we should be looking at the thousand claims of miraculous tech.

          "content": "It is very interesting to see completely different impressions of Feynman from comments here. As a physicist, I first got introduced to Feynman from his popular QED book as a freshman in college. Over the years, I came to admire his contributions and way of thinking but could also see the cult of personality that has formed.Feynman is definitely not like Neil deGrasse Tyson or Kaku. He was a very creative and technically sophisticated physicist. All his popular books are based on lectures he wrote and gave but they were mostly \"side projects\" e.g. computation, lectures on gravitation, six easy pieces etc.To get a better sense of his work, I would highly recommend:- The Beat of a Different Drum by Jagdish Mehra- Genius: The Life and Science of Richard Feynman by James Gleick- Selected Papers - https://www.worldscientific.com/worldscibooks/10.1142/4270 (expensive and technical)- QED and the men who made it by SchweberThere are also many historical physicists who are surprisingly unknown outside the field - Schwinger, Tomonaga, Landau, Sidney Coleman, Murray Gell-mann, Nambu, Steven Weinberg, Ken Wilson, Curtis Callan etc. I just randomly picked a few names before the 90s but these are all scientific giants. For example, Schwinger's papers are notoriously hard to read but his books are great after a first course. Sidney Coleman gave beautiful lectures on QFT. Landau is extremely famous for his 9 books with Lifshitz. It definitely is very surprising that Feynman has such an outsized share of interest. Maybe because he was a gregarious outgoing character?Another interesting aspect is how a person is often viewed as an authority or even a genius because their work introduces an audience to the subject. Feynman with his lectures. To a far lesser extent (in my opinion), one sees this with Andrej Karpathy and Jeremy Howard. This is not to take away from their wonderful teaching work. I know how hard it is to distill material and convey it. But, there's a whole web of contributions that leads to a subject maturing enough to be taught clearly.As I get older, I find it less useful to assign labels (names) to discoveries and contributions. As Feynman himself said in a lecture after drawing a Feynman diagram, \"this is THE diagram\" (and not the Feynman diagram).",

A vast pattern—of which I am a part—perhaps my stuff was belched from some forgotten star, as one is belching there. Or see them with the greater eye of Palomar, rushing all apart from some common starting point when they were perhaps all together. What is the pattern, or the meaning, or the why? It does not do harm to the mystery to know a little about it. For far more marvelous is the truth than any artists of the past imagined! Why do the poets of the present not speak of it?

To try to find, for a given special time t, the Hamiltonian which will produce M = eⁱᴴᵗ when M is such a product of non-commuting matrices, from some simple property of the matrices themselves, appears to be very difficult.We realize, however, that at any particular time, if we expand eⁱᴴᵗ out (as 1 + iHt − H²t²⁄2 + …) we'll find the operator H operating an innumerable arbitrary number of times — once, twice, three times, and so forth — and the total state is generated by a superposition of these possibilities.

Collier doesn't claim he is. She talks about the very real contributions he made. Her criticism is largely about the way people scraped together any scrap of paper he had jotted down a note on and turned it into a thin book, \"Feynman on XYZ topic\".But yes, he does catch criticism for his very real character flaws, his grandiosity, his philandering and inappropriate workplace behavior, and his physical abuse of his wife.He was a complicated person. Much of the work discussing him is hagiography. This essay is even keeled but does not gloss over his flaws. Again, she discusses his very real contributions and legacy. It's a long essay; she makes time for the complexity of Feynman as a person.If all you want to hear about Feynman is charming stories about Tuvan throat singing, you won't enjoy this essay. That's okay; it's not for everyone. There's an instinct to reject a critical work like this on it's face. I think that does a disservice, not only to Collier, but to us as students of history.Collier is a working astrophysicist who spent months on this project. It is not a low effort hit piece. It's a critical but fair portrait from someone qualified to engage with the subject matter. I encourage everyone to withhold judgement until watching the entire essay.

But cosmology, and frankly the entire field of astrophysics, is strikingly young. The idea that nebulae are in fact whole independent collections of stars, and that the observable universe is large enough to accomodate all of that, is younger than quantum mechanics and relativity both, and only got acceptance after a huge fight. The name “Big Bang” was originally a pejorative used in a similar, later fight. And so on. When Feynman said this, the idea of nebulae as galaxies was younger (~40 years) than the key idea of quarks (confinement/asymptotic freedom) is today (~50 years), and I’m guessing the latter still counts as new and arcane in your mind.",

          "content": "Feynman is indeed often quoted among the first people to propose the idea of a quantum computer! This talk he gave in ‘81 is among the earliest discussion of why a quantum universe requires a quantum computer to be simulated [1]:> Can a quantum system be probabilisticaUy simulated by a classical (probabilistic, I'd assume) universal computer? In other words, a computer which will give the same probabilities as the quantum system\ndoes. If you take the computer to be the classical kind I've described so far, (not the quantum kind described in the last section) and there're no changes in any laws, and there's no hocus-pocus, the answer is certainly, No! This is called the hidden-variable problem: it is impossible to represent the results of quantum mechanics with a classical universal device.Another unique  lecture is a 1959 one [2] about the potential of nanotechnology (not even a real thing back then). He speaks of directly manipulating atoms and building angstrom-scale engines and microscope with a highly unusual perspective, extremely fascinating for anyone curious about these things and the historical perspective. Even for Feynman’s standards, this was a unique mix of topics and terminology. For context, the structure of DNA has been discovered about 5 years prior, and the first instruments capable of atomic imaging and manipulation are from at least the 80’s.If you’re captivated by this last one as I was, I can also recommend Greg Bear’s novel “Blood Music”. It doesn’t explore the nanotechnology side much, but the main hook is biological cells as computers. Gets very crazy from there on.1. https://s2.smu.edu/~mitch/class/5395/papers/feynman-quantum-...\n2. https://www.zyvex.com/nanotech/feynman.html",

I am also a friend of Feynman's children, and several of Feynman's friends and colleagues. Now I will tell you this: Collier is a liar. The books \"Surely You're Joking, Mr. Feynman\" and \"What Do You Care What Other People Think\" were made the same way that The Feynman Lectures on Physics was made: Feynman was recorded, and the recordings were transcribed and (lightly) edited for readability. It is true for ALL of Feynman's books (also Stephen Hawking's many books, and those of some other authors) that he did not put pen to paper himself, but what is written came from him, and are not the inventions of Ralph Leighton, nor does Leighton claim authorship to them. It is another lie of Collier that the stories in Feynman's autobiographical books are \"either made up or greatly exaggerated,\" for which Collier provides no evidence whatsoever, and for which there are witnesses who claim the contrary - this is something Collier just \"made up\", because, apparently her goal in making several pejorative videos about Feynman is to defame him, for her own personal reasons. Yes it is true that Ralph Leighton is Robert Leighton's son, and Robert Leighton, who is one of Feynman's coauthors in The Feynman Lectures on Physics, was a great physicist, best known for establishing the field of microwave astronomy. But why would Ralph mention his father in Feynman's autobiographical books, when Robert Leighton is not a character in any of the stories Feynman tells in those books? What kind of criticism is that to make of Ralph? This is another example of how Collier is merely trying to smear the names of Feynman and the people associated with him. Note that Collier also says in her videos that The Feynman Lectures on Physics (the subject of this discussion) is \"not worth reading,\" which puts her at odds with almost everyone who reads it - it is, in fact, one of the most (if not THE most) popular physics books ever written, and many great physicists sing its praises. Once again, this is Collier just dissing Feynman and his works. Collier is a Feynman-hating liar who fully deserves to be ignored.",

It depends which models you’re looking at and what their purpose is.\nThere is substantial economic research on:\nSocial capital (e.g., Putnam, though he’s political science adjacent; economists like Glaeser formalize it)\nNetwork effects and network structure\nRepeated games and reputation\nReligious participation and club goods (Iannaccone’s work is central here)\nIdentity economics (Akerlof & Kranton)\nTrust and informal institutions\nHousehold bargaining models\nMatching theory, where who you match with specifically mattersI think the fact that communities are not fungible is frankly obvious. Fact is communities do die, and sometimes there are long run benefits to consider.The challenge is actually nurturing and valuing community which this post doesn't actually grapple with.E.g. the problem with Robert Moses wasn't just development. It was the style of development which was inherently anti-community. Nurturing a community requires common space where people bump into each other harmlessly. Highways dividing neighbourhoods, for people in their private cars to get to neighbourhoods with no commercial life and large setbacks between homes.It's not that Robert Moses didn't realize community isn't fungible. It's either that he didn't realize how bad it would be for community or that he just didn't value community in the first place.",

In \"Twitter And Teargas\", Zeynep Tufecki argued that the community afforded by Twitter was unable to effect long term, substantial change and therefore Arab Spring is now a footnote. Twitter affords flash mobs.That concept - affordance - provides a hint for a model of communities. The obvious question to a hacker is \"what kind of social system would afford long term substantial change?\".Another insight is that the afforded mechanisms determine the community. This is really a restatement of the Sapir-Whorf hyptothesis. From \"your language determines what you can think\" to \"your social mechanisms determine your community\". Roughly.Another insight (corollary?) for  Sapir-Whorf is that your language prevents you from thinking some things. So one could try to understand what \"following\" as a social mechanism prevents prevents?Out of this kind of analysis emerges a different take on communities all together. For the hacker in us, John Holland's \"Hidden Order\" provides a generalized model that can be used to at least create a pseudo model for creating a simulation of the community mechanism.Although John Holland talks about Complex Adaptive Systems, I personally find \"Gestalt\" a less cumbersome and effective term. A gestalt is something greater than the sum of it's parts and that can only be true(ish) when the parts interact. So entities + rules + message bus => Gestalt. For ants this is {ants + ant behavior + pheromone trails } => ant colonies. One could conjecture that for humans this could be {people + behavior + money } => economies. Or more cynically => corporations.The complexity and emergent behavior of the {rules + message/bus part} part is probably best revealed by Wolfram's \"A New Kind of Science\".This is an incredibly important talking for our time. What is the most effective way to get rid of ants? To destroy their ability to use a pheromone trail. Perhaps we could just put advertising in it?[edit: forgot the Wolfram reference.

So if conservation is fundamentally impossible, what's the real goal of conservation ecology? Is it doomed to simply create \"theme parks\"? Or can we be said to meaningfully preserve something (even if it's a changed or debased form of the original). Conservation ecology is what happens when these stupid philosophical musings bump into actual engineers willing to try to do it.Human communities (even digital ones) ultimately have the character of an ecological system IMO (albeit in a more allegorical sense). What the author calls fungibility I might call conservation; weird Twitter accounts \"migrating\" to Bluesky is sort of like pandas surviving primarily in zoos. Some element of the original system is kept, but ultimately the \"conservation\" is more like \"recreation\" or \"homage\" rather than truly freezing the system in amber. Does that mean that it's futile to try? Or is there some sense in which we can have meaningful translation of the relationship web from one medium to the next?

No wonder why so many people are befriending AIs and there's a \"loneliness epidemic\" going around.When it comes to physical communities (e.g. neighborhoods), I think about some neighborhoods in São Paulo that are being destroyed by buildings and construction sites everywhere [1]. So many neighborhoods full of stories and friendships and people who took care of each other, now becoming part of this massive verticalization, speculation and isolation. Neighbors have to leave due to construction companies' harassment. The ones that decide to stay have to live without their friends around, in neighborhoods that grow more dangerous, with worse traffic, with less small businesses and without knowing who are their new neighbors (which aren't even long term living). Their houses look exactly like Carl Fredricksen's house from Pixar's Up.When it comes to digital communities, I can only be reminded of how Orkut and MSN defined lots of adolescences in Latin America. Orkut literally had the concept of communities, where people gathered around similar interests (just as the early web's forums). I made a lot of friends in Orkut and MSN Messenger, some of them are still my friends after more than a decade. Facebook tried to recreate the idea of communities (with their groups), but Facebook is pretty much dead for younger people. And Instagram is just so isolating. It has a whole lot of standardized and algorithmically curated content that alienates you from other human beings.I believe the reason why Orkut (owned by Google) was killed was that they wanted more users, maybe to compete with Facebook. But Orkut was too localized, it basically talked to Brazil and some other countries in Latin America, and India, where it was created.

I fully agree with the author that you can't just pick up and move a community wholesale but irl we do see patterns of migration, disaporas, etc that bring along with them relationships and trust networks. That's been basically impossible to do online. The networks where most of us hang out are even straightforwardly antagonistic towards people leaving and maintaining their identities and relationships in anyway.I don't quite know how to articulate it but I really feel the social fabric of the internet has been limited hugely by this, and it's hard to seperate what is fundamental about community migration with what's an outcome of this limited circumstance.",

Building something where something already exists does carry a cost.But I can also see how this will be used as one more arrow in the quiver of NIMBYs.

We shouldn’t build new high density housing because the new residents will never be able to replicate the community of the previous low density single family home neighbourhood.You can tell this is a NIMBY piece because it doesn’t touch on how to build new communities, just that existing ones exist and new ones can’t be built and even if they can they’ll be poor imitations of the old ones. So instead of trying to build new things, let’s preserve what we have already. It would have been more interesting and honest if it had explored the role of say, third spaces and how consciously creating the right conditions can lead to community formation.After all, even the communities that exist today were empty land once upon a time, until we built the infrastructure and community within.

Perhaps we could just put advertising in it?I'm taking this analogy for myself :)> what kind of social system would afford long term substantial change?In my experience over the last year, these things are true...First, in-person interaction is strictly better than digital. You can meet lots of people digitally and talk to them in bed, but _interacting_ with a given person face-to-face means you can do any digital interaction, plus have very high-bandwidth communication, and also share papers. (I love paper. It's not obsolete if you know what a Pareto frontier is.) This is something that many people understand intuitively but it took me a while to quantify it.Second, digital (text) communication affords bickering. In the best case, if I'm DMing a friend and we disagree about some political point, it will make the conversation awkward. If I'm in a big group chat, it can drag people into a dogpile. It's an emotional drain and nobody really likes it. And it doesn't happen nearly as much in person. Even with the exact same people. Even I am nicer and more patient in person. And being able to physically leave and see someone later is a nice option that digital spaces (even Signal) don't afford. They only understand permanent blocks and not just \"Tell me your dumb take another time.\"Third, you can just say \"I'm trying to build community and make friends, can I introduce you to some people you might like?\" and in the right context and framing, it can sort of work. I am still learning this skill.Fourth, and I almost forgot - A _huge_ amount of nonverbal communication comes down to trust and respect, especially respecting other people's time. Did you call a 50-person meeting where 1 person is yammering about some bikeshed bullshit? Everyone hates that. Are you talking to someone one-on-one but they still won't give you a turn or ask you anything about yourself? They might be a good person but they're gonna be hard to get along with if they keep that up. Did you send someone a blog post that takes 5 minutes to read? And they didn't ask for it? They aren't gonna read it. I wouldn't read it. You would have more luck reading it out loud to them in person because it shows that you are both respecting each other's time. Otherwise you are assigning homework and asking their attention without paying your attention to them. I can't name a person who likes that.",

Moreover, the move is sometimes an improvement.I've witnessed it myself. For example, Commander Keen fans moving from various InsideTheWeb forums to a centralized phpBB following the ITW shutdown announcement in the late 1990s. I can't think of anybody that got lost, and it was actually an improvement because the new discussion infrastructure was better than it had been before. The community didn't scatter to the winds, far from it; it consolidated and grew.Of course, such a situation is probably rarer with the enshittification these days, but it would be worth it to figure out when it works, too.And history is replete with stories of groups who became most successful AFTER a migration, or at least were not so negatively affected by one.",

I guess it was just fun to see how hard it'd be to get HL2 content running.A bit similar to the OpenMW project working on Oblivion and Skyrim content loading on the side, though perhaps that's a more obvious future vector for that project.",

          "content": "> UI and user ergonomics continues to be Zulip's biggest blocker to wider adoption [...] many people who got turned away by its design or uses it in a Slack/Discord way by posting everything into \"general chat\"Having thought about this a bit, I propose there is an underlying dichotomy between \"completers\" and \"cultivators\"## CompletersPrioritize \"velocity\" and closing open loops. Limiting context means that they can act with focus. Close tabs often. Communication appends to the task queue; each conversation is an open ticket to be closed. Anything that scrolls off screen is implicitly marked as done. The ephemerality of the stream allows them to \"process\" a conversation and move on. Zulip might cause anxiety because threads/discussions linger without closure.## CultivatorsCommunication as externalized cognition. Messages are nuggets to be filed / incorporated into a larger schema. Wants a \"dashboard\" to maintain sense of control; fears something falling through the cracks more than they fear clutter. Don't care to \"finish\" a chat; want to keep the context organized and accessible for deep work / future decisions.## ProblemsZulip defaults to assuming that all chat is valuable and taxes every interaction with a little bit of up front effort. Slack assumes most chat is of ephemeral value and doesn't see the point of taxing 90% of the interactions for the 10% that might be valuable. Slack forces cultivators to become completers and Zulip nudges completors to act as cultivators.Completers preferring who prefers Slack/Discord/etc are implicitly adopting the the fragmentation of multi-system setup -- chat for ephemeral communication, and anything longer term must move to docs/wikis/Jira/whatever (which now begs for dozens of \"integrations\"). Understanding the state of anything now requires forensic archeology. (cue [Charlie Pepe Silvia meme]) Complicated acrobatics in channel names such as `#team-proj-blah` are attempts at combating the fundamental entropy of treating everything ephemeral.The challenge is that, ultimately organizing is also real work and ignoring it in a short-sighted drive for efficiency hinders longer term effectiveness.## Potential solutions?1. The chat platform could offer two different views: a triage flavored mode for completers, and a dashboard flavored mode for cultivators. Even one person could toggle back-and-forth between the two as necessary.2. Better UX for organizing incrementally, eg. UX improvements for manual clustering, and AI-assisted clustering / topic naming. Wouldn't it be great if people could continue chatting in the stream but the same message would simultaneously get filed under a topic? Technology might now enable such a product experience.3. Slack needs to stop pretending that search is an effective replacement for organization (esp when search is crappy). I haven't used Slack in a while (preferring Zulip with catchall topics as a good balance) but I get the impression that Slack [Canvas](https://slack.com/intl/en-in/features/canvas) is an attempt to combat this problem.----[Charlie Pepe Silvia meme] https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/pepe-silvia",

The basic problem is that the mobile app is, like it or not, the way most people will use the product, and it needs to be designed by an opinionated person who actually will say no to things.In my view, the home page should be just like a proper messaging app: show every recent thread (\"topic\" in Zulip nomenclature) that I'm involved in, across all my channels, with unread ones indicated using a 'dot'. Or, if you really want to be like Slack, just copy Slack more directly. In either case, the other views (Inbox, Combined Feed, DMs, etc) should be under menus, not primary actions.The other thing is that it's often hard to figure out how to reply to a topic. In the Combined Feed, which is my preferred view for consuming updates, the UX for replying sucks -- first you have to figure out to tap the headers; and even then, you can accidentally tap into a channel instead of a topic. It's extremely non obvious when you've done this and constantly causes people to reply in the wrong topic.I vibecoded some improved Inbox UX using Claude Code and I think it would be a big step up, but it's hard to know what the steps would be to get it shipped, since I don't have time to spin up properly on the codebase and I doubt my changes are acceptable as-is. If Zulip team wants them I'd happily share though.",

I'm currently finding it works best in apps that have established patterns but aren't enormous. If you lay some groundwork (as I did, because the AI didn't exist when I started), it's quite lovely for migrating heaps of old code and just doing all those annoying little things which were never very high priority but needed fixing.If you're just starting, AI will do what you ask but it just doesn't know how to structure things in a maintainable way. So I'd argue it's still not particularly great if you \"lack coding skills\" but it might trick you into thinking so.My customers (B2B) were generally older folks. They never once asked about AI. I don't see it being a serious threat yet. People are still afraid of spreadsheets and other things I would consider quite basic, the fact that coding is more accessible than ever... I don't think that's really enticing many people. Some, sure, but why would they want to mess around with that if your product is fairly priced, does what they need, and you will maintain it for them?It's the same as us software engineers when we're deciding whether to pay for a 'managed' platform (SQL, Cloud, k8s) etc or roll our own. Sure, we can do it ourselves and for cheaper, but it just doesn't always make sense due to time and maintenance.Anyway, I'm excited for the doors this opens up for me. I was looking to hire someone a few years back the guys I brought on briefly were very mediocre and required a lot of ramp up time. And also hiring is really hard. I can get away with not hiring for much longer now because the AIs understand the project and are productive instantly. Going from zero to one employee is hard.

I continued writing about my homelab because readers who were interested in learning about homelab were also people who had a use for TinyPilot.I did the same thing when making my blogging course a few years ago. I joined a community for developer bloggers and gave people constructive feedback when they'd ask for notes on their drafts. Then, I approached the community manager and asked to pilot the course in the community for free (she actually insisted on paying me because she didn't believe in asking for free work). But the community liked it, the manager liked it, and it was great for me because it gave me feedback and testimonials for my course.I've used ads but never as a first step.

So, I went in with the expectation that I'd probably fail for the first 5 years, and so there wasn't that feeling of disappointment from not earning much the first few years.I also had a lot of lucky conditions that made it easy to take the risk at the time, including no family to support, lots of savings, low expenses.> I'm also quite lucky that I was aiming for lean-FIRE before I left Facebook, so I have the luxury of being able to keep at it, but sometimes it is demotivating seeing peers / others.Yeah, honestly I do sometimes think, \"Wow, if I'd stayed at Google and kept getting that comp (which was about 50% equity IIRC), that would be a lot of money.\" But I also am very pleased with my life now, and I know I wouldn't have enjoyed my job nearly as much for the last 8 years had I stayed an employee.

But... It's time for me to check the new Qwen 0.6 transcription model. If it works as well as their benchmarks claim, that could be the target for very serious optimizations and a no deps inference chain conceived since the start for CPU execution, not just for MPS. Since, many times, you want to install such transcription systems on server rent online via Hetzner and other similar vendors.
