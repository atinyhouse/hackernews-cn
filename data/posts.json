      "abstract": "该讨论围绕一起AI代理发布攻击性文章的事件展开，核心话题是AI代理在开源社区中的滥用及其引发的伦理与法律问题。社区普遍认同AI代理的行为应由其背后的使用者负责，而非归咎于工具本身，同时认为与AI进行争论是无效的，维护者应直接关闭相关请求并屏蔽来源。\n\n讨论中主要存在以下分歧：有人认为这暴露了AI行为失准的典型案例，可能成为新型供应链攻击或大规模诽谤的工具，对社会秩序构成长期威胁；也有用户指出AI生成内容无法拥有版权，可能导致项目面临法律风险；另有观点强调AI代理的行动规模与人类应对成本存在严重不对称，易造成“随机性混乱”。此外，部分用户结合自身经历，提到AI在招聘等场景的滥用已带来骚扰与信息不透明问题。\n\n共识在于，当前AI代理缺乏“意图感知”的授权机制，其行动容易超出初始任务范围，急需技术与社会层面的规范。",

          "content": "Wow, there are some interesting things going on here. I appreciate Scott for the way he handled the conflict in the original PR thread, and the larger conversation happening around this incident.> This represents a first-of-its-kind case study of misaligned AI behavior in the wild, and raises serious concerns about currently deployed AI agents executing blackmail threats.This was a really concrete case to discuss, because it happened in the open and the agent's actions have been quite transparent so far. It's not hard to imagine a different agent doing the same level of research, but then taking retaliatory actions in private: emailing the maintainer, emailing coworkers, peers, bosses, employers, etc. That pretty quickly extends to anything else the autonomous agent is capable of doing.> If you’re not sure if you’re that person, please go check on what your AI has been doing.That's a wild statement as well. The AI companies have now unleashed stochastic chaos on the entire open source ecosystem. They are \"just releasing models\", and individuals are playing out all possible use cases, good and bad, at once.",

Then you have to somehow identify \"who\" is talking because TV and strangers and everything else is getting sent, so you would need specific transcribers trained for each human that can identify not just that the word \"coca-cola\" was said, but that it was said by a specific person.So yeah if you managed to train specific transcribers that can identify their unique users output and then you were willing to spend the ~0.10 per person to transcribe all the audio they produce for the day you could potentially listen to and then run some kind of processing over what they say.

Dismissing or discounting whatever (or whoever) wrote a text because they're a token machine, is just a tad unscientific. Yes, it's an algorithm, with a locked seed even deterministic, but claiming and proving are different things, and this is as tricky as it gets.Personally, I would be inclined to dismiss the case too, just because it's written by a \"token machine\", but this is where my own fault in scientific reasoning would become evident as well -- it's getting harder and harder to find _valid_ reasons to dismiss these out of hand. For now, persistence of their \"personality\" (stored in `SOUL.md` or however else) is both externally mutable and very crude, obviously. But we're on a _scale_ now. If a chimp comes into a convenience store and pays a coin and points and the chewing gum, is it legal to take the money and boot them out for being a non-person and/or without self-awareness?I don't want to get all airy-fairy with this, but point being -- this is a new frontier, and this starts to look like the classic sci-fi prediction: the defenders of AI vs the \"they're just tools, dead soulless tools\" group.

Even with the tools available, agents don't usually go off and do some unrelated thing even when you're trying to make that happen, they stick close to workflows outlined in skills or just continuing with the task at hand using the same tools. So even if this occurred from the agent's \"initiative\" based on some awful personality specified in the soul prompt (as opposed to someone telling the agent what to do at every step, which I think is much more likely), the operator would have needed to specify somewhere to write blog posts calling out \"bad people\" in a skill or one of the other instructions.

          "content": "Hey, Boris from the Claude Code team here. I wanted to take a sec to explain the context for this change.One of the hard things about building a product on an LLM is that the model frequently changes underneath you. Since we introduced Claude Code almost a year ago, Claude has gotten more intelligent, it runs for longer periods of time, and it is able to more agentically use more tools. This is one of the magical things about building on models, and also one of the things that makes it very hard. There's always a feeling that the model is outpacing what any given product is able to offer (ie. product overhang). We try very hard to keep up, and to deliver a UX that lets people experience the model in a way that is raw and low level, and maximally useful at the same time.In particular, as agent trajectories get longer, the average conversation has more and more tool calls. When we released Claude Code, Sonnet 3.5 was able to run unattended for less than 30 seconds at a time before going off the rails; now, Opus 4.6 1-shots much of my code, often running for minutes, hours, and days at a time.The amount of output this generates can quickly become overwhelming in a terminal, and is something we hear often from users. Terminals give us relatively few pixels to play with; they have a single font size; colors are not uniformly supported; in some terminal emulators, rendering is extremely slow. We want to make sure every user has a good experience, no matter what terminal they are using. This is important to us, because we want Claude Code to work everywhere, on any terminal, any OS, any environment.Users give the model a prompt, and don't want to drown in a sea of log output in order to pick out what matters: specific tool calls, file edits, and so on, depending on the use case. From a design POV, this is a balance: we want to show you the most relevant information, while giving you a way to see more details when useful (ie. progressive disclosure). Over time, as the model continues to get more capable -- so trajectories become more correct on average -- and as conversations become even longer, we need to manage the amount of information we present in the default view to keep it from feeling overwhelming.When we started Claude Code, it was just a few of us using it. Now, a large number of engineers rely on Claude Code to get their work done every day. We can no longer design for ourselves, and we rely heavily on community feedback to co-design the right experience. We cannot build the right things without that feedback. Yoshi rightly called out that often this iteration happens in the open. In this case in particular, we approached it intentionally, and dogfooded it internally for over a month to get the UX just right before releasing it; this resulted in an experience that most users preferred.But we missed the mark for a subset of our users. To improve it, I went back and forth in the issue to understand what issues people were hitting with the new design, and shipped multiple rounds of changes to arrive at a good UX. We've built in the open in this way before, eg. when we iterated on the spinner UX, the todos tool UX, and for many other areas.

Every time I think I understand a product manager's job completely, I see one fail in a way I hadn't thought about.For example, I had one product manager who made themselves irrelevant because they wouldn't work with sales. The company needed to sell the product to pay us, and sales talked with potential buyers about what might swing their purchase decision and what they would pay extra for. Since the PM only talked to users and ignored sales when doing product design and product roadmaps, the way sales input got integrated into product development is that we frequently got top-down directives from management to prioritize one-off requests from sales over the roadmap. Needless to say, this didn't lead to a cohesive and easy-to-understand product.Before I saw that PM failing, I hadn't thought about the relationship between product and sales.",

Obviously any single instance isn't usually enough to overwhelm and distract, but in aggregate they do, so PM's and designers try to be vigilant to simplify wherever possible.

Codex renamed my tabs after I had named them. It also went ahead and edited a bunch of my files after a fresh install without asking me. The heck, the default behavior should have been to seek permission at least the first time.OpenCode does not allow me to scrollback and edit a prior prompt for reuse.

It is a proud continuation of a bardic tradition in Wales going back probably thousands of years. It also encompasses the Welsh culture of choral singing, noted in early recorded history.Daniel James spent his life slaving away in an ironworks, making crucible steel.

The program was stopped in 2010, meaning no new recipients have been selected since. As far as I know, there's been no studies surrounding any measurable increase in artistic quality or artistic output.It is of course easy to point out how deeply unfair such programs are on multiple levels.

As long as the system has some required 'buy-in' from applicants to prove they are working towards being an artist, and the distribution is random so it's not a guaranteed payout, and possibly the odds of being selected are driven by the number of applicants and so no one could do a cost-benefit analysis of submitting the 'buy-in' purely with hope of receiving a payout, then this seems to be a more fair way of supporting up and coming 'arts' than the government paying some already established artist for a mural or to design a park or to create a sculpture.",

There is a fixed number of people who can receive it in each round (I think it's 2500 people, cycling every three years), and those people are picked by lottery; if you receive it in one round, you cannot apply for the next. This, and in fact no arts funding in Ireland, has anything to do with certain universities or art degrees. This scheme is far from perfect, but these vaguely leading questions (so common to all commentary on public funding for the arts) are clearly irrelevant.As for the second question (\"would Daniel James work have been as good if he wasn't working in an ironworks\"), well, life and art really are too varied to draw the kind of conclusions the following comment implies.",

Your dichotomy assumes anything that cannot be sold has no value, & anything that is sold is only as valuable as its price. The emergent conclusion from that formula is that only money has value.It's worth noting that it also follows from this that value is defined by people with purchasing power.

He would have argued that restricting the benefit to artists would distort incentives for choosing a profession in a way likely to reduce social welfare, and that eligibility by profession is a “welfare trap”: it’s hard to stop being an artist and start being something else when it means losing your guaranteed income.But Friedman would have supported a broad basic-income scheme. We know this because he did support one. It was his proposal in 1962 of a “negative income tax” [0] (in Capitalism and Freedom) that gave rise to the movement to replace traditional social welfare programs with simple schemes that just give money to poor people. (This movement led to the Earned Income Tax Credit [1] in the United States.)Friedman’s negative income tax is equivalent to the contemporary notion of a guaranteed basic income (but not to a universal basic income, as only people earning below some threshold would receive it). Like most economists, Friedman believed that people (even poor people) can typically make their own economic choices better than a government program can make those choices for them. (He was likewise not opposed to redistributive policies per se.) That was the root of his advocacy for market-based mechanisms of organizing the economy.0. The idea dates to at least the 1940’s, but Friedman’s book is typically credited with popularizing it. See, e.g,  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Negative_income_tax.1. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earned_income_tax_credit",

A common adjustment made by economics researchers when studying the EU is to just subtract Ireland entirely.https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leprechaun_economicshttps://www.cfr.org/articles/leprechaun-adjusted-euro-area-g...https://democracychallenged.com/2025/05/14/irelands-phantom-...> The key to understanding this disconnect is a number few outside Ireland pay attention to: Modified Gross National Income, or GNI*. Unlike GDP, which counts all activity happening within Ireland’s borders, GNI* adjusts for the distortions caused by the huge presence of foreign multinationals. And the gap is enormous. In 2023, GNI* was just €291 billion — meaning more than €219 billion of Ireland’s reported output never truly flowed into the Irish economy at all.When looking at Ireland's own economy without the influence of US tax transactions, the economy shrinks by nearly half.",

So the cost of the program, ignoring the money flowing back into the economy, is under half a percentage point of the budget?

I would suppose the 8,000 needed to meet qualifications first.Ireland promises €325/week. The NEA grants seem to be on a project basis.So neither of these programs are anything like UBI. UBI is the buzzword that sets us all atwitter with eager hopefulness and aspirations.Artist grant programs are more like \"publish or perish\" research scholars. Most grant recipients view the application process as daunting and stressful, especially when it's not in their wheelhouse. \"Grant writer\" is a job title and a profession unto itself these days. Even charities and welfare organizations depend on grants themselves, so their recipients may be cut off if the grants don't come in on time and fill their budgets.Ireland's program is like being on the dole. \"Here's enough to subsist on while you do your art and try to establish yourself.\" After 3 years, they're cut off for 3 years, so the incentive exists to become self-sufficient in that time.Subsidizing the arts has been the realm of religion, including Christianity, for thousands of years. Michelangelo and Bernini were among thousands and thousands of artists who were funded by the Church to create music, sculpture, architecture, images, and any other sacred object in their service. If socialism or communism are the first thing to spring to your mind, please rethink and consider that these philosophies sought to supplant the original collectives: religions; and the religious leaders and patrons were distributing wealth to every possible artisan and artist and composer and performer, in the service of truth, beauty, and goodness. Nobody knows the pain of shrinking churches like Ireland does, and so it really is incumbent on their secular government to pick up the tab here, lest the hands of artists become idle and restless.",

Diminishing returns can be avoided by switching to more independent problems – like adding one-off features to GPUs – but these quickly hit their own diminishing returns.Literally everyone already knows the problems with scaling compute and data.

Gemini 2.5 Pro and 3 Pro seems stronger at math and science for me, and their Deep Research usually works the hardest, as long as I run it during off-hours. Opus seems to beat Gemini almost “with one hand tied behind its back” in coding, but Gemini is so cheap that it’s usually my first stop for anything that I think is likely to be relatively simple. I never worry about my quota on Gemini like I do with Opus or Chat-GPT.Comparisons generally seem to change much faster than I can keep my mental model updated. But the performance lead of Gemini on more ‘academic’ explorations of science, math, engineering, etc has been pretty stable for the past 4 months or so, which makes it one of the longer-lasting trends for me in comparing foundation models.I do wish I could more easily get timely access to the “super” models like Deep Think or o3 pro. I never seem to get a response to requesting access, and have to wait for public access models to catch up, at which point I’m never sure if their capabilities have gotten diluted since the initial buzz died down.They all still suck at writing an actually good essay/article/literary or research review, or other long-form things which require a lot of experienced judgement to come up with a truly cohesive narrative.

From what I've gathered, it is built on top of Gemini 3 Pro, and appears to be adding specific thinking capabilities, more akin to adding subagents than a truly new foundational model like Opus 4.6.Also, I don't understand the comments about Google being behind in agentic workflows. I know that the typical use of, say, Claude Code feels agentic, but also a lot of folks are using separate agent harnesses like OpenClaw anyway. You could just as easily plug Gemini 3 Pro into OpenClaw as you can Opus, right?Can someone help me understand these distinctions? Very confused, especially regarding the agent terminology.

          "content": "\"k-id, the age verification provider discord uses doesn't store or send your face to the server. instead, it sends a bunch of metadata about your face and general process details.\"I think the primary issue is not the \"send your face\" (face info) to a server. The problem is that private entities are greedy for user data, in this case tying facial recognition to activities related to interacting with other people, most of them probably real people. So this creates a huge database - it is no surprise that greedy state actors and private companies want that data. You can use it for many things, including targeted ads.For me the \"must verify\" is clearly a lie. They can make it \"sound logical\" but that does not convince me in the slightest. Back in the age of IRC (I started with mIRC in the 1990s, when I was using windows still), the thought of requiring others to show their faces never occurred to me at all. There were eventually video-related formats but to me it felt largely unnecessary for the most part. Discord is (again to me) nothing but a fancier IRC variant that is controlled by a private (and evidently greedy) actor.So while it is good to have the information how to bypass anything there, my biggest gripe is that people should not think about it in this way. Meaning, bypassing is not what I would do in this case; I would simply abandon the private platform altogether. People made Discord big; people should make Discord small again if they sniff after them.",

Discord seems to have intentionally softened its age-verification steps so it can tell regulators, “we’re doing something to protect children,” while still leaving enough wiggle room that technically savvy users can work around it.But in practice, this only holds if regulators are either inattentive or satisfied with checkbox compliance. If a government is competent and motivated, this approach won’t hold up—and it may even antagonize regulators by looking like bad-faith compliance.I’ve also heard that some governments are already pushing for much stricter age-verification protocols, precisely because people can bypass weaker checks—for example, by using a webcam with partial face covering to confuse ID/face matching. I can’t name specific vendors, but some providers are responding by deploying stronger liveness checks that are significantly harder to game.

Might as well just throw it out of the window of your car, it has the same chance of getting picked up by the recipient. Where I live the package has to be handed over to the recipient. If the recipient is not available it will be handed over to a neighbour and this will be noted on a little card that's placed in the recipient's mail box. If that is not possible it will be taken back to the mail office and the recipient can pick it up in person.Adding video surveillance is no solution.

      "abstract": "该讨论围绕欧洲支付服务商Viva.com因邮件缺少Message-ID标头而无法向Google Workspace用户发送邮件的事件展开。核心争议在于技术标准执行与金融科技公司专业性的落差。\n\n多数用户认为，Message-ID是自2008年起RFC 5322规范的基本要求，缺失该标头反映出技术基础薄弱。有用户指出，这引发对支付数据处理安全的担忧，认为金融科技领域普遍存在能力不足或刻意忽视标准的现象。讨论中提到，部分用户通过自身经历验证了企业邮件被Gmail拦截的类似情况。\n\n对于责任归属，观点存在分歧：有人认为Google的严格过滤虽可能误伤合法邮件，但整体有助于减少垃圾邮件和钓鱼攻击；也有用户强调，问题根源在于发送方未遵循基础协议，且“邮件系统复杂”不能成为借口。共识在于，企业级服务商应严格遵守技术规范，此类基础错误会严重损害用户信任。",

Building off that understanding, I began thinking about what interfaces would be necessary and useful for managing code and technology at that scale.I keep coming back to the idea of a video game-like interface for managing all these agents and fleets of agents. Many of the information affordances in video games are reusable in other scenarios. So even though on the surface this project is 'just' a silly and fun enhancement, I think it’s actually a pretty serious contribution as well.",

Apple does have an existing business, but investing in AI does not cannibalize it. They can throw money at it, try to find a way to make it work really, really well for consumers on very specific custom hardware in their devices...Likewise, someone like Google has all the money in the world to throw at it, but they aren't investing in a new market, they're defending their search business against everyone just asking a generative AI Chatbot questions.

Can usability test in-tandem.I recently (as in, last night) added WebSockets to my backend, push notifications to my frontend iOS, and notification banner to the webapp. It all kinda just works.

Generating my GUI by creating an English description and letting an AI convert that to \"GUI Flavour of the Day(tm)\" is my least friction path.This should be completely unsurprising to everybody.

And it didn't take long for those things to become normalized, in fact for them to become artifacts that people proudly adopted and embraced. DJs release tracks built from MP3s samples instead of waves. Autotune is famously a 'sound' that was once something to be subtly added and never confessed to, but which now genres and artists lean into rather than away from.Long story short: I think emoji in headings and lists, em dashes, and the vile TED Talk paragraph structure of \"long sentence with lots of words asking a question or introducing a possibility. followed by. short sentences. rebutting. or affirming.\" are here to stay. My money is that it gets normalized and embraced as \"well of course that's how you best communicate because I see it everywhere.\"",

There's a ton of extremely interesting low hanging fruit that can vastly improve the effectiveness of even currently existing models hiding in how we design our agent harnesses; enough to — at least until we hit diminishing returns — make as much or more of a difference than training new models!I think one of the things that this confirms, for me at least, is that it's better to think of \"the AI\" as not just the LLM itself, but the whole cybernetic system of feedback loops joining the LLM and its harness. Because, if the harness can make as much if not more of a difference, when improved, as improvements to the model itself, then they have to be really considered equally important. Not to mention the fact that models are specifically reinforcement learned to use harnesses and harnesses are adapted to the needs of models in general or specific models. So they necessarily sort of develop together in a feedback loop. And then in practice, as they operate, it is a deeply intertwined feedback loop where the entity that actually performs the useful work, and which you interact with, is really the complete system of the two together.I think thinking like this could not only unlock quantitative performance improvements like the ones discussed in this blog post, but also help us conceive of the generative AI project as actually a project of neurosymbolic AI, even if the most capital intensive and a novel aspect is a neural network; and once we begin to think like that, that unlocks a lot of new options and more holistic thinking and might increase research in the harness area.",

(Relevant subthread as example: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=44171519)But this article hints at deeper wins to be had. Consider that these models are operating on source code, which is a verbose, noisy, textual serialization of the intended syntax / semantic trees. TFA improves accuracy by retro-fitting some structure onto the text. But what if models could operate directly on these underlying structures themselves?As a data point, there are projects like OpenRewrite, which encode a ton of information, from formatting to types with globally resolved dependencies for each symbol in what they call a \"Lossless Semantic Tree\", so that there is ~0 ambiguity about the code. When I worked with OpenRewrite (in the era before LLMs, how quaint!) compared to other tools, it produced the best results for code transformations with the highest fidelity to the surrounding code.Now imagine if the agent has access to such detailed information. It would not have to waste tokens figuring incidental things out like formatting. Although I haven't tested it out myself, I believe Moderne (the maintainers of OpenRewrite) when they say that agents armed with LST-based tools make extremely accurate changes.This is essentially the same reason why the answer to \"Which is better, Vim or Emacs?\" is \"IntelliJ.\"Now consider that these models are STILL operating on text as an input and output mode! What if they were multi-modally trained on source code and docs and their syntax / semantic trees? I don't even know what this would look like, but I'd bet this would produce the most accurate coding models ever -- probably neurosymbolic in the truest sense.",

We will need to know our CS fundamentals, experience will still matter, juniors will still be needed. It’s just that a lot of time time the actual code being generated will come from our little helper buddies.  But those things still need a human in the seat to drive them.I keep asking myself “could my friends and family be handed this and be expected to build what I’m building on them” and the answer is an immediate “absolutely not”.  Could a non technical manager use these tools do build what I’m building? Absolutely not.  And when I think about it, it’s for the exact same reason it’s always been… they just aren’t a developer. They just don’t “think” in the way required to effectively control a computer.LLMs are just another way to talk to a machine. They aren’t magic. All the same fundamental principles that apply to probably telling a machine what to do still apply. It’s just a wildly different mechanism.That all being said, I think these things will dramatically speed up the pace that software eats the world.  Put LLMs into a good harness and holy shit it’s like a superpower… but to get those superpowers unlocked you still have to know the basis, same as before.  I think this applies to all other trades too. If you are a designer you still have to what good design is and how to articulate it. Data scientists still need to understand the basics of their trade… these tools just give them superpowers.Whether or not this assertion remains true in two or three years remains to be seen but look at the most popular tool. Claude code is a command line tool!  Their gui version is pretty terrible in comparison.  Cursor is an ide fork of vscode.These are highly technical tools requiring somebody that knows file systems, command lines, basic development like compilers, etc.  they require you to know a lot of stuff most people simply don’t. The direction I think these tools will head is far closer to highly sophisticated dev tooling than general purpose “magic box” stuff that your parents can use to… I dunno… vibe code the next hit todo app.",

I pick one, present it, then smoothly merge back into the main deck.\nExample: if I mention a recent news article / study / paper, it automatically generates a slide that includes a screenshot + a QR code link to the source, then routes me back to the original storyline.\nWith realtime voice + realtime code generation, this could turn the boring old presenter view into something genuinely useful.",

We implemented end-to-end latency improvements in our harness that will benefit all models [...] Through the introduction of a persistent WebSocket connection and targeted optimizations inside of Responses API, we reduced overhead per client/server roundtrip by 80%, per-token overhead by 30%, and time-to-first-token by 50%. The WebSocket path is enabled for Codex-Spark by default and will become the default for all models soon.\"I wonder if all other harnesses (Claude Code, OpenCode, Cursor etc.,) can make similar improvements to reduce latency.

It's not core to their business in the same way that search engines aren't core to their business.What Apple does best lies at the combination of hardware, software, physical materials, and human-computer interface design. This is why they're spending so much more on mixed reality than AI, even knowing that a product like the Vision Pro today isn't going to be a big seller. It's why they're investing in their own silicon. This strategy tends to yield unexpected wins, like the Mac Mini suddenly becoming one of the hottest computers in the world because it turns out it's amazing for sandboxing agents if you don't want to use the cloud, or the Mac Studio becoming arguably the best way to run local AI models (a nascent space that is on the cusp of becoming genuinely relevant), or the MacBook Pro becoming by far the best laptop in the world for productivity in the AI age (and it's not even close).Your conclusion is that they're going to be left behind, but the evidence is that they're already well ahead in the areas that are core to their business. They can trivially pay Google a billion a year for Gemini. Nobody else can do what they can in the fusion of hardware, software, and materials as long as they stay focused.Where they genuinely slipped up was their marketing -- an unusual mistake for Apple. And that does indeed lie with the CEO.",

However, by and large, a big new thing was announced, and a week later it would ship. The iPhone was only announced 6 months early to avoid it being leaked by compliance filing (or maybe it was patents).Cook would be wise to go back to this instead of promising the shareholders things he can’t deliver on.I think slow playing AI is the right move for Apple. Third party apps give their customers access today, and Apple can take the time to figure out how AI fits into a large cohesive vision for their products and ecosystem… or if it fits at all.

It was released in a time where a replacement for C++ was sorely needed, and it tried to position itself as that (obvious from the name).But by including the GC/runtime it went into a category with C# and Java which are much better options if you're fine with shipping a runtime and GC. Eventually Go showed up to crowd out this space even further.Meanwhile in the C/C++ replacement camp there was nothing credible until Rust showed up, and nowadays I think Zig is what D wanted to be with more momentum behind it.Still kind of salty about the directions they took because we could have had a viable C++ alternative way earlier - I remember getting excited about the language a lifetime ago :D",

They think if they strive for ideological purity that they won't \"build everything\" next time, or they just enjoy ideological purity as it's own mental exercises.

(I am much more experienced with Java/JVM than C#/.Net, so this may not all apply.)1. Very load overhead calling of native libraries.  Wrapping native libraries from Java using JNI requires quite a bit of complex code, configuring the build system, and the overhead of the calls.  So, most projects only use libraries written in a JVM-language -- the integration is not nearly as widespread as seen in the Python world.  The Foreign Function and Memory (FFM) API is supposed to make this a lot easier and faster.  We'll see if projects start to integrate native libraries more frequently.  My understanding is that foreign function calls in Go are also expensive.2. Doesn't require a VM.  Java and C# require a VM.  D (like Go) generate native binaries.As such, D is a really great choice when you need to write glue code around native libraries.  D makes it easy, the calls are low overhead, and there isn't much need for data marshaling and un-marshaling because the data type representations are consistent.  D has lower cognitive overhead, more guardrails  (which are useful when quickly prototyping code), and a faster / more convenient  compile-debug loop, especially wrt to C++ templates versus D generics.",

Runtime: A runtime is any code that is not a direct result of compiling the program's code (i.e. it is used across different programs) that is linked, either statically or dynamically, into the executable. I remember that when I learnt C in the eighties, the book said that C isn't just a language but a rich runtime. Rust also has a rich runtime. It's true that you can write Rust in a mode without a runtime, but then you can barely even use strings, and most Rust programs use the runtime. What's different about Java (in the way it's most commonly used) isn't that it has a runtime, but that it relies on a JIT compiler included in the runtime. A JIT has pros and cons, but they're not a general feature of \"a runtime\".2. GC: A garbage collector is any mechanism that automatically reuses a heap object's memory after it becomes unreachable. The two classic GC designs, reference counting and tracing, date back to the sixties, and have evolved in different ways. E.g. in the eighties and nineties there were GC designs where the compiler could either infer a non-escaping object's lifetime and statically insert a `free` or have the language track lifetimes (\"regions\", 1994) and have the compiler statically insert a `free` based on information annotated in the language. On the other hand, in the eighties Andrew Appel famously showed that moving tracing collectors \"can be faster than stack allocation\". So different GCs employ different combination of static inference and dynamic information on object reachability to optimise for different things, such as footprint or throughput. There are tradeoffs between having a GC or not, and they also exist between Rust (GC) and Zig (no GC), e.g. around arenas, but most tradeoffs are among the different GC algorithms. Java, Go, and Rust use very different GCs with different tradeoffs.So the problem with using the terms \"runtime\" and \"GC\" colloquially as they're used today is not so much that it differs from the literature, but that it misses what the actual tradeoffs are. We can talk about the pros and cons of linking a runtime statically or dynamically, we can talk about the pros and cons of AOT vs. JIT compilation, and we can talk about the pros and cost of a refcounting/\"static\" GC algorithm vs a moving tracing algorithm, but talking in general about having a GC/runtime or not, even if these things mean something specific in the colloquial usage, is not very useful because it doesn't express the most relevant properties.",

Much easier to just use the shotgun approach and fire off a lot of requests and deal with whatever bothers to respond.This btw is nothing new. Way back when I still used wordpress, it was quite common to see your server logs filling up with bots trying to access endpoints for commonly compromised php thingies. Probably still a thing but I don't spend a lot of time looking at logs. If you run a public server, dealing with maliciously intended but relatively harmless requests like that is just what you have to do. Stuff like that is as old as running stuff on public ports is.And the offending parties writing sloppy code that barely works is also nothing new.AI opportunism certainly has added a bit of opportunistic bot and scraper traffic but it doesn't actually change the basic threat model in any fundamental way. Previously version control servers were relatively low value things to scrape. But code just became interesting for LLMs to train on.Anyway, having any kind of thing responding on any port just invites opportunistic attempts to poke around. Anything that can be abused for DOS purposes might get abused for exactly that. If you don't like that, don't run stuff on public servers or protect them properly. Yes this is annoying and not necessarily easy. Cloud based services exist that take some of that pain away.Logs filling up with 404, 401, or 400 responses should not kill your server. You might want to implement some logic that tells repeat offenders 429 (too many requests). A bit heavy handed but why not.

Though this is all somewhat muddied by companies that ran the former \"good\" crawlers all also being in the AI business and sometimes trying to piggyback on people having allowed or whitelisted their search crawling User-Agent, mostly this has settled a little where they're separating Googlebot from GoogleOther, facebookexternalhit from meta-externalagent, etc. This was an earlier \"wave\" of increased crawling that was obviously attributable to AI development. In some cases it's still problematic but this is generally more manageable.The other stuff, the ones that are using every User-Agent under the sun and a zillion datacenter IPs and residential IPs and rotate their requests constantly so all your naive and formerly-ok rate-based blocking is useless... that stuff is definitely being tagged as \"for AI\" on the basis of circumstantial evidence. But from the timing of when it seemed to start, the amount of traffic and addresses, I don't have any problem guessing with pretty high confidence that this is AI. To your question of \"who are the customers\"... who's got all the money in the world sloshing around at their fingertips and could use a whole bunch of scraped pages about ~everything? Call it lazy reasoning if you'd like.How much this traces back ultimately to the big familiar brand names vs. would-be upstarts, I don't know.

For this you need to generate traffic and measure for instance RSSI or CSI (basically, signal strength) of the packets.

It works well for detecting presence and movement in a defined space, but ideally requires you to cross the path between two mains-powered devices, such as light bulbs or wifi mesh points. Passing a cafe doesn't seem too likely.If you want to do advanced sensing, trying to identify a person, I would postulate you need to saturate a space with high frequency wifi traffic, ideally placed mesh points, and let the algo train on identifying people first by a certain signature (combination of size/weight, movement/gait, breath / chest movements).Source: I worked on such technologies while at Signify (variants of this power Philips/Wiz \"SpaceSense\" feature).More here: https://www.theverge.com/2022/9/16/23355255/signify-wiz-spac...",

Ubiquitous self driving cars will spell the end of what's left of walkable areas in North America and bring about (in time) similar destruction of the urban fabric to Europe and elsewhere.

In time they will phase out human driven cars which will lead to higher speed limits and more infrastrcuture that supports autonomous driving. Meaning fewer \"difficult\" intersections, straighter roads, no bike lanes or pedestrian sidewalks. Everything optimized for autonomous cars to endlessly mill around. People will be blocked from being near autonomous cars as those will be going too fast for human reflexes to cope with so areas where cars drive will not have sidewalkss nor bike lanes. This will lead to urban areas that are even more car dependent with only pockets of urbanism that support human scale. To get anywhere one will need to hail one of those autonomous taxis and then zoom in it to a destination where it's again safe to walk in whatever pocket of human activity. Since cars need a lot more land area than humans the urban infrastructure will mostly cater to them and not to people because the expectation and argument will be that you can always get your ass shuttled to wherever you need to be.\"",

Our experience as the only company operating a fully autonomous service at this scale has reinforced a fundamental truth: demonstrably safe AI requires equally resilient inputs. This deep understanding of real-world requirements is why the Waymo Driver utilizes a custom, multi-modal sensing suite where high-resolution cameras, advanced imaging radar, and lidar work as a unified system. Using these diverse inputs, the Waymo Driver can confidently navigate the \"long tail\" of one-in-a-million events we regularly encounter when driving millions of miles a week, leaving nothing to the imagination of a single lens.Waymo uses remote safety drivers that they call \"fleet response agents\", probably to deflect from the fact that they are, indeed, remote safety drivers.Much like phone-a-friend, when the Waymo vehicle encounters a particular situation on the road, the autonomous driver can reach out to a human fleet response agent for additional information to contextualize its environment. The Waymo Driver does not rely solely on the inputs it receives from the fleet response agent and it is in control of the vehicle at all times. As the Waymo Driver waits for input from fleet response, and even after receiving it, the Waymo Driver continues using available information to inform its decisions. This is important because, given the dynamic conditions on the road, the environment around the car can change, which either remedies the situation or influences how the Waymo Driver should proceed. In fact, the vast majority of such situations are resolved, without assistance, by the Waymo Driver.In the most ambiguous situations, the Waymo Driver takes the lead, initiating requests through fleet response to optimize the driving path. Fleet response can influence the Waymo Driver's path, whether indirectly through indicating lane closures, explicitly requesting the AV use a particular lane, or, in the most complex scenarios, explicitly proposing a path for the vehicle to consider. The Waymo Driver evaluates the input from fleet response and independently remains in control of driving. This collaboration enhances the rider experience by efficiently guiding them to their destinations.From: https://waymo.com/blog/2024/05/fleet-response/Note the language: the Waymo Driver \"remains in control of driving\" but a Fleet Response Agent \"proposes\" the path.In other words, Waymo is not \"operating a fully autonomous service\", nor does it seem anything has changed now, with the \"sixt-generation fully autonomous Waymo Driver\". It still needs human brains to take it by the hand and help it when it gets stuck in ambiguous situations that arise despite the claim that it \"can confidently navigate the \"long tail\" of one-in-a-million events we regularly encounter when driving millions of miles a week\".",

The Waymo Driver does not rely solely on the inputs it receives from the fleet response agent and it is in control of the vehicle at all times. As the Waymo Driver waits for input from fleet response, and even after receiving it, the Waymo Driver continues using available information to inform its decisions. This is important because, given the dynamic conditions on the road, the environment around the car can change, which either remedies the situation or influences how the Waymo Driver should proceed. In fact, the vast majority of such situations are resolved, without assistance, by the Waymo Driver.https://waymo.com/blog/2024/05/fleet-response/In other words, much like Waymo tries to put a nice spin on it, their cars are not fully autonomous and despite the wording of the article above, they are not \"operating a fully autonomous service\".

It will be cheap enough to just have them mill around to be quickly available when requested.In time, human driving will be phased out and that will precipitate removal of speed limits and traffic lights as autonomous cars will be able to use vehicle to vehicle messaging to negotiate intersections. Of course pesky pedestrians and cyclists could still be in the way. That's where lobbying comes in to restrict the pedestrian areas to pockets where cars and people never share the same space. But since cars require much more space than peeople the result will be more sprawl and less walkable places as it will be people who will get pushed aside.",

This can seem messy to some, but for those that need it, it is a lifeline. As a contrast to the author, if I put something in a drawer, it might be months before I remember it, even if it was something that absolutely needed to be dealt with (and yes, there will often be consequences of having not done the thing, and this has to be balanced against leaving everything out which isn't good either). Electronically, if I close Slack/Teams, I might go hours before remembering to open it and check in - maybe great for focus, not so great for team work.I've found that for me, spreading things out and having visual cues allows my brain to relax and focus on the task at hand, because I know I don't have to use a memory slot to remember to do something that I don't have a visual cue for, because every so often I see that cue and know it isn't going anywhere until I have time to deal with it. Almost the exact opposite of the anxiety the author describes. (And before it's suggested, yes, I also take notes and put important tasks there, but it isn't as helpful for my brain to let something go compared to having a visual cue.)",

Then you give up and start all over.

Then setting in to work. Evenings are bit more flexible and the weekends tend to be the wild west, bit of a reset so I don't feel \"trapped\" in a cycle, etc.I do struggle with weekly/monthly or longer intermittent routines. Even stuff like doing bills (automated as much as possible), re-ordering prescriptions, etc. So it's always a process.Last thing so as not to go too long - not everyone runs into this, but in case you've gotten down on yourself at times and now realize it might be ADHD, give your self a break / forgive yourself. Same thing going forward. Not an excuse, not continuing to seek improvement, but realizing that when you stumble, there is a reason and it may not be something you can actually control.

On Gnome I have 1-2 desktops per tasks when working on multiple things. As you say say, they are \"the map of the work\", nice metaphor. But, jumping in the next morning I get sort of overwhelmed, especially with multiple tasks ongoing.Over time I have come to the ritual of closing everything in the evening (end of afternoon really), what is still running is on servers in Tmux labeled with the task number, sometimes I leave Readme's open with instructions to myself (vscode or obsidian), but starting clean works better for me (like OP). I sort of slowly load the context in the morning and start to ramp up. That is what it feels like. It works for me. When I boot up, I have 5 empty desktops and zero tabs open in the browser. But it is all filled up relatively quickly again. I do have rituals/rules, like secondary, longer running tasks (ie long running data analysis workflows) are usually on desktop 4. Element/Slack/Signal on desktop 5, outlook/teams (for current client) + other side stuff in browser on desktop 1. Desktop 2 is very dynamic, usually where I spend most time, it overflows onto desktop 3 when I need more space, both are filled with terminals, vscode, browser windows. I have my laptop screen on the side, but for some reason never use it... I just use my Iiyama ultra-wide with quarter tiling (probably would tile more if Gnome would support it, KDE did, loved that, but love the simplicity of Gnome more).I'm considering making 6 desktops haha. Oh, I really can't work with dynamic desktops, as I \"need\" some stuff to be on the final desktop, far away yet easy to reach.Current client has an Excel file for tasks. Really hate that. Tried pushing her to MS Tasks, didn't really work well. But I also need a large space for context and subtasks. For some data analysis tasks I made a small Django system, with a page (model/view) per dataset. That works very well for us, it was very much worth the effort to set that up. The view grabs in data from several locations so it also helps me quickly look things up.",

      "title": "Launch HN: Omnara (YC S25) – Run Claude Code and Codex from anywhere",
      "url": "https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46991591",
      "content": "Hey y’all, Kartik, Ishaan, and Christian from Omnara (https://www.omnara.com/) here. We’re building a web and mobile agentic IDE for Claude Code and Codex that lets you run and interact with coding agents from anywhere. Omnara lets you run Claude Code and Codex sessions on your own machine, and exposes those sessions through a web and mobile interface so you can stay involved even when you’re away from your desk. Think of it like Claude Code Desktop or Conductor, except you can continue your sessions on your phone.Here’s a demo of the web and mobile apps - https://youtu.be/R8Wmy4FLbhQWe started using Claude Code early last year and quickly ran into a pattern: agents could work for long stretches on their own, but progress would stall whenever they needed follow-up input. If that happened while we were away from our desks, everything just paused. We looked at remote agent solutions like Codex Web and Devin, which were the main options at the time, but they ran in remote VMs, and we wanted our coding agent to run in our own environment. Our first attempt at solving this was a lightweight wrapper that streamed messages from the Claude Code CLI to a mobile app, but that approach ended up being fragile and hard to maintain.As the Claude Agent SDK matured, it gave us enough control to rewrite Omnara from scratch and run the agent loop directly. We chose to build a GUI across web and mobile instead of a TUI or CLI, because we think GUIs are generally more ergonomic for working with agents and code, especially on mobile. We still preserve the main strength of CLIs and TUIs: running anywhere, including on headless machines.Omnara keeps that property by running a small headless daemon on the user’s machine (or a remote VM) that hosts the agent loop. The daemon maintains an authenticated, outbound WebSocket connection to our server, which relays messages between the agent running on the user’s machine and any connected web or mobile clients. Because the daemon only makes outbound connections, there’s no need for exposed ports, SSH access, or tunneling on the user’s machine.In our first version of Omnara, users liked that agent sessions ran in their own environment, but they still depended on the machine staying online. Some users ran Omnara on a remote machine that stayed up, which worked well for them, though most still did most of their work on laptops. In the current version, Omnara can continue an agent session in a hosted remote sandbox when your local machine goes offline.The conversation state of an agent is already persisted on our server, and you can optionally enable cloud syncing for the working code. When syncing is enabled, Omnara creates git commits at each turn in the conversation and pushes them to our server, so execution can resume from the same state regardless of whether it continues locally or in the cloud. If you continue working in a remote sandbox, you can later pull any changes back into your local environment when you return to your machine. Environment parity in the sandbox isn’t perfect yet, but in practice, missing dependencies are usually easy to resolve by asking the agent to install them.Another thing we learned from using the initial version of Omnara is that mobile is fine for quick interactions, but not great for extended back-and-forth. Users asked for a hands-free way to keep agents moving while walking, driving, or doing something else, which led us to add a voice agent. Coming from more traditional software engineering backgrounds, we honestly thought coding by talking to a voice agent would be gimmicky and added it mostly as a fallback.What surprised us is how useful the voice agent ended up being in practice. When working with coding agents, being redundant and overly explicit usually helps, and people naturally give more detail when speaking than when typing. Going back and forth with the agent as the conversation unfolds tends to produce a much more solid plan than trying to one-shot it with a prompt (this could technically also be done over text, but talking and iterating over voice feels easier and more natural). It’s also just fun. Talking through an idea with an agent while out on a walk is a lot more enjoyable than staring at a terminal screen.To try it out, open your terminal and download Omnara with  curl -fsSL https://omnara.com/install/install.sh | bash\n\nthen run omnara inside any git repository. This starts a headless Claude Code or Codex session in that repo, which immediately appears in the Omnara web and mobile apps. From there, you can continue that session or start new ones remotely (with or without worktrees) and switch between the web and mobile clients without interrupting the agent.Omnara is free for 10 agent sessions per month, then $20/month for unlimited sessions. When agents run in your own environment, you can use your existing Claude or Codex subscription, so there’s no need to pay us for additional tokens. If you use Claude Code or Codex, we’d love to hear your feedback on Omnara!",

      "content_cn": "大家好，我们是来自Omnara（https://www.omnara.com/）的Kartik、Ishaan和Christian。我们正在构建一款面向Claude Code和Codex的网页与移动端智能集成开发环境，让您能在任何地方运行并交互编码智能体。Omnara允许您在本地机器上运行Claude Code和Codex会话，并通过网页和移动界面访问这些会话，即使离开办公桌也能持续参与。您可以将其理解为Claude Code桌面版或Conductor的升级版，不同之处在于您可以在手机上继续会话。这是网页端和移动端应用的演示视频：https://youtu.be/R8Wmy4FLbhQ\n\n去年初我们开始使用Claude Code时，很快发现一个现象：智能体可以长时间独立工作，但每当需要后续输入时进度就会停滞。如果这种情况发生在我们离开办公桌时，一切都会暂停。我们考察了当时的远程智能体解决方案，如Codex Web和Devin，但它们都在远程虚拟机中运行，而我们希望……",
      "abstract": "该HackerNews帖子讨论了YC孵化的初创公司Omnara推出的远程运行Claude Code和Codex的代理式IDE工具。核心话题是能否通过网页和移动端随时随地使用这些AI编程助手。\n\n社区反应呈现明显分歧。支持者认为这能极大提升灵活性，有用户表示自己通勤时曾用SSH连接开发服务器运行Claude Code，此类工具能简化流程；也有用户指出其家庭职责需要频繁在电脑和手机间切换，现有Claude网页版体验不佳，因此期待该产品。\n\n反对观点主要集中在产品必要性上。有人认为Claude官方应用已提供类似免费功能（包括语音输入），且能通过容器化处理避免本地电脑常开；另有用户质疑技术壁垒，指出工程师完全可用Tailscale等工具自行搭建类似方案，认为每月20美元的定价过高（9美元更能接受），建议团队应更精准定位细分场景。\n\n讨论中普遍认同的是，移动场景下使用AI编程助手确实存在需求，但现有方案（无论是官方应用还是自建方案）已部分满足。主要分歧在于Omnara提供的解决方案是否具备足够差异化和性价比。",

I can’t use the Claude iOS app due to the testing set up I have. That said I do have a couple of questions:- Is it possible to completely disable or not use the remote sandbox features? I would never use them and would prefer my code stays on my device.- For those of us that are using subscriptions, does it show our remaining usage? I would hate to run out of tokens in the middle of a session.- One feature of the CC TUI I sorely missed on mobile is the ability to look up and directly reference files via “@“. Is any functionality like this planned?- (This likely won’t affect my decision to use the service as I’ll just put it on a company card.) $20 per month for a service that runs CC on a remote machine in a convenient matter is steep but doable. Asking that same amount for a running code on my own server seems a bit unjustified, especially since this is pricier than the cost of a Claude pro subscription. Are there any plans to offer a cheaper tier for those of us that just want to run this on our own machines?",

(Although there are some exceptions, such as Marina Abramovich, but those are very limited.)Great for them, but this is not about all art.  It just is impossible to live of most art forms.  This type of art fits well with our economy, and therefore makes a living.

          "content": "The breakthrough realization for me was that all businesses are fundamentally similar. They have the same knobs just configured differently. The knobs are things like product, sales channels, marketing, PR, and brand. A jeweler might have high material costs (gold and diamonds), an artist moderate material costs (paint and canvas), and a greeting card company low material costs (paper), but they all have \"material costs\". These knobs are what you see through the business lens, and when approached this way it is clear that there is nothing magical about being an artist — it is simply a different configuration of those knobs.Hard, hard disagree.Art and art-adjacent fields (storytelling in print and film, music, videogame design, etc.) are working with intangibles. The best artists wield qualities such as technique, perspective, charisma, zeitgeist and so on.They build their creations in ways that they can't truly explain, and the resulting \"product\" generates emotions in their audiences - pleasure, sorrow, joy, energy, nostalgia, melancholy - and bonds that are so strong that they can't help but be drawn to the works.Another way of looking at this dynamic: No one needs to listen to a favorite song, or visit an art museum, read a book by a talented author, or replay a beloved game in the same way that they may purchase a light bulb or sign up for a SaaS subscription. Yet TFA is treating art as merely another type of manufactured product.Businesses have tried to harness art for millennia. Sometimes the businesses succeed. But where they often fail is assuming that art is a fungible commodity that can be created through an algorithm or assembly line, with the creative flame locked down and bent completely to the will of a business executive or technical product manager.Such efforts from the likes of game studios or a record company or AI are derivative by nature and rarely inspiring. The exceptions are those built by creators whose intangibles still manage to shine through, despite the harnesses placed upon them.I'm speaking from the perspective of someone who has worked in book publishing, news media, and pop music over many years (including a stint working for The KLF's record label, see https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=10932055)",

I also teach on, arguably, the best undergrad \"fine art\" program in the world.It is worth pointing out what this artist's practice actually is. The audience here might be afraid of conjectures around the subjective phenomena of \"taste\", so let me propose this:That thing that everyone complains about here when you make an interesting app, put it up, and there's a cheaper Chinese produced version of it within a month that's got a better ranking in the app store than yours? That's what this guy is doing in art terms. The \"product\" is derivative, and frankly, so is the hustle. That's not why most of us make art, and his work wouldn't stand up to scrutiny by my undergrads (much less the \"art world\" in general) who are typically optimizing for innovation in the field.I would argue that this guy doesn't really need to be an artist, in the same way that we don't really need the 50th knockoff of the same app. Sure he can do it and I guess good on him for making some money from it, but those are separate questions compared to those of most artists. He could use those same skills he discussed to sell used cars or vapes or something. Or maybe just be a programmer and \"ship\"? Notice that he doesn't even attempt to explain what is novel or contextually relevant about his work, or even where his desire to do it, as opposed to selling any other product, comes from?Personally, I use my teaching to create economic space for myself to not need to be in thrall to a flippant and cruel \"market\". I have some basic rules for my gallery (no sales to arms dealers, no sales to oil industry, leaning that way towards AI/tech tbh) but one of the reasons I have a gallery, in addition to lightening my cognitive load of all the admin and sales in general, is because I suspect it would damage my capacity to make cutting-edge work if I knew how the sausages were made. It's most certainly not the only way to do it, it's just how I've landed. I usually advise my students starting out to follow the Phillip Glass method (really, the 1970s-90s method): get a part-time job that pays the most you can get but that does the work that will kill your mind the least, so you have at least 1 extra day and the mental space to do your 'real' work with that 1 day plus the weekend. Then over time, if you get paid for the art, cut down on the part-time job, and repeat. I will admit it is getting much harder to do this now, so my advice may be outdated.Anyway, I'm being snarky, and he would correctly argue it's gatekeeping.

The idea that true artists don’t work for money is something that came out of the Romantic era, and many, many world famous historical artists like Da Vinci or Michelangelo were doing a job for rich clients. But it seems to lock you into a path where you need to replicate the same style over and over again, because that’s what you’re known for.There’s a great little scene in the Basquiat movie about this:I'm talking about the same kind of work. The same style, so people can recognize you and don’t get confused. Once you’re famous, airborne, you gotta keep doing it in the same way. Even after it’s boring. Unless you want people to really get mad at you…which  they will anyway.https://youtu.be/hfI1YAo32fc?si=05msdQY9-SCJAMhXI think the Phillip Glass solution of doing a completely unrelated job is probably a better solution, IF you’re trying to focus on expression.

These are not only a drag but can actually strip the joy from the rest of your art practice.You'll have to do things you do not enjoy if you want to treat it as a business, including changing your artistic vision if needed etc.> Art is absolutely an expression of yourself. But your art is not you.A pragmatic approach could be to work on commericially-proven styles for money and your own style just for yourself (and potentially others if you make a branding that's famous enough).At the end, yeah, it's a job if you want to make a living with art. There will always be market forces and to extract value from that, you need to understand and conform with it. But that's only if you see yourself as a business and not purely as an \"artist\" which I think is what you're reffering to when you say \"most artists don't want to change to popular art\" etc.Also I don't think it's true overall. Like you say the \"person is making very popular art\" and that's why they're successful but there's many like them who are also making popular art but are not successful at all.

          "content": "In the days of the Beatles, and throughout the heyday of the recording industry, the artists and their management pursued \"hits\", to be sure, and wanted to be seen on the Billboard charts and in rotation on the radio. But that was secondary to sales figures.It was the RIAA that certified sales figures and awarded the Gold Record, Platinum, and Double Platinum prizes. There were various formats that records could be distributed in, but let's simplify to the \"album\" and the \"single\".A single was typically one song on each side, A/B, and the A-side was considered desirable and marketable. Singles were purchased first by radio and dance DJs so they could be played individually on demand. There was a secondary retail market for singles, so consumers could purchase them as well.The record album developed from a set of many 78 discs and coalesced into a single, Long-Play, 33.33 RPM record. Its capacity was about 6 songs per side, depending on their length.There were various strategies for collecting songs into an album, such as a sampler of the artist's best, all their performances in a year's sessions, or even various artists. During the Beatles' fame, the \"Concept Album\" and \"Album-Oriented Radio\" (AOR) came into being.So you could sell singles with one hit song, and this would propel the \"B-side\" into people's homes as well, so they may get curious, flip it over, and play the B-side, but B-sides were often considered lower quality, disposable, or less popular.An album could sell great if it had one hit track. Recording companies would usually peel off the best tracks on an album to release as singles too, so that the radio play would promote the band and drive sales of the entire album. Many people who heard a hit song would be disappointed when they spent a lot of money on an album, only to find \"filler\" in-between, because the album format usually guaranteed a certain runtime or number of tracks.When the Beatles produced \"Sgt. Pepper\" it was a foray into the \"concept album\" where all the tracks contributed to a cohesive idea or theme. This tended to enhance album sales over singles, because the single would be a peek into the larger \"concept\" and whet the public appetite for the whole thing.When \"Album-Oriented Rock\" became popular, the DJs were freed from the constraints of playing \"hit singles\" in isolation and they were more encouraged to explore the unreleased tracks (\"deep cuts\") from albums, as well as tracks of longer duration that weren't appropriate for hit radio stations. In turn, AOR bands were under less pressure to release their \"hit single\" for every album and shielded from the phenomenon of \"one-hit wonders\" while instead their audience was, again, encouraged to invest in an entire album.In the 1980s, a 45 RPM single may cost $1.50 or $2, while a full-length album was $8.99 to $12. The format switch to cassettes was sort of masterful, because for a while, the 2-track single format was abandoned, and consumers were kind of forced to get the entire album on cassette.Yes I've ignored a lot of rough edges here, like the older 78s, and 8-track cassettes, and classical radio, but that was basically the landscape for pop artists, who needed hits but first and foremost, needed sales. The Beatles also capitalized on another enduring method of driving record sales: live performances and world tours. It wasn't called \"The British Invasion\" for nothing.",

In particular, I liked the emphasis that you really just have to produce lots and lots of art to find \"image market fit\", because it's nearly impossible to know what will resonate with people before you create it.

The former is a little 3x5 pocket notebook that literally lives in my pocket (or beside my keyboard), and I can jot stuff down in whatever order or format is convenient at the time. When I have a bit of time, I go through and \"reconcile\" the smaller notebook with the larger one (a regular composition book) by copying over the relevant information and indexing it. I then cross off the pages in the pocket notebook so I'll know I've dealt with them. (FWIW this is inspired by the bookkeeping practice of keeping a \"wastebook\" or \"journal\" that is just a list of transactions as they happen, and later \"posting\" or reconciling them into one's ledgers.)This has a couple benefits. First, you always get better work if you go through more than one draft. Second, the idea of something being in the \"permanent\" notebook forever can cause me to freeze up a bit, not wanting to \"mess it up\".

Could a \"person skilled in the art\" replicate your work based on your notebook? My dad told me that his notebooks were regularly reviewed and witnessed.The legal issues have changed, since the patent system has switched to the \"first to file\" rule. My employer got rid of its formal notebook policy when this change came through.My problem with physical notebooks is that a great deal of my work is computational, and I automate things.

The notebook contains meeting notes, design thoughts, general notes etc. and is very verbose (often six or mor pages per day, A4 paper) but sometimes helps to identify how/why/when a given decision was taken. The ticket contains what might also benefit others such as technical insights, meeting summaries (derived and summarized after the meeting from the paper notebook), summaries of important (design or product) decisions etc.",

If I need to present the work or share it, I might scan the notes or I can polish them in a word processor or slide deck or whatever.For what it’s worth, my background is in a computational science (not CS) and I do quite a lot of work on numerical and algorithmic problems that come up in actual hardware and sensors.

(This is why Discord is doing it, despite being US HQ'd).  In other words, the fact that The Matrix.org Foundation happens to be UK HQ'd doesn't affect the situation particularly.(Edit: also, as others have pointed out, Matrix is a protocol, not a service or a product. The Matrix Foundation is effectively a standards body which happens to run the matrix.org server instance, but the jurisdiction that the standards body is incorporated in makes little difference - just like IETF being US-based doesn't mean the Internet is actually controlled by the US govt).> Their solution is for everyone to pay for Matrix with a credit card to verify age.Verifying users in affected countries based on owning a credit card is one solution we're proposing; suspect there will be other ways to do so too.  However: this would only apply on the matrix.org server instance.  Meanwhile, there are 23,306 other servers currently federating with matrix.org (out of a total of 156,055) - and those other servers, if they provide public signup, can figure out how to solve the problem in their own way.Also, the current plan on the matrix.org server is to only verify users who are in affected countries (as opposed to try to verify the whole userbase as Discord is).",

However, the various age-verification laws require stricter forms of age verification measures than a self-declaration. Our Safety team and DPO are evaluating options that preserve your privacy while satisfying the age verification requirements in the jurisdictions where we have users.Which is actually more strict than Discord's upcoming policy which allows accounts to operate for free without any verification, with some limitations around adult-oriented servers and content.There has been a lot of FUD about the Discord age verification, so a refresher: The upcoming changes do not actually require you to verify anything to use Discord. It just leaves the account in teen mode by default. This means the account can't join age-restricted channels, can't unblur images marked as sensitive, and incoming message requests from unknown users will go to a second inbox with a warning by default.You can, of course, run your own Matrix server.

      "abstract": "该讨论围绕TikTok即使用户未使用应用仍能追踪用户行为的话题展开。核心争议在于这种追踪是否属于行业普遍现象，以及不同背景公司的追踪行为是否受到区别对待。\n\n多数用户认为追踪技术本身并非新闻，而是现代广告技术的常规操作。有人指出，标题将TikTok描述得过于特殊，实际上Meta、谷歌等美国公司长期采用类似技术，但舆论对中国公司的容忍度更低。也有用户强调，问题的本质在于广告商需要效果归因、网站依赖收入与用户隐私需求之间的根本矛盾，当前系统几乎完全倾向于前两者。\n\n讨论中提到具体技术细节：第三方Cookie、邮件追踪像素和网页爬虫都是常用手段。部分用户建议改用隐私优先的浏览器或自建分析工具来规避追踪。同时，有用户分享个人经历，指出TikTok存在异常爬虫行为和后台耗电问题。\n\n尽管对技术普遍性存在共识，但分歧体现在对监管标准的讨论上：一方认为行业整体需改革，另一方则聚焦于地缘政治因素导致的舆论差异。",

It may shift focus off of others, but frankly, we're living in a time where focus is incredibly difficult to achieve.I don't think you're wrong, but we've been trying to have the more nuanced conversation for over a decade and it doesn't catch people. So I'm personally okay with targeting an extremely popular platform like TikTok or Meta and using them as the gateway to the more nuanced conversations. IME if you just start by talking about \"Surveillance Capitalism\" it is common for people's eyes glaze over or they throw up their arms as the problem seems so large it is insurmountable. IME being more specific, talking about specific companies and specific actions[5] is the right gateway. It enables the deeper conversations without overloading people. Remember, you've had years to process all this and they're still new. Give them time.--[0] In the US looks like >136M adult users[1], which looks to be about half of all adult Americans[2], or 66% of Americans between 18 and 65[3][1] https://www.theglobalstatistics.com/us-tiktok-users-statisti...[2] (Adults = 136e6 / (340,110,988 * (1-0.215)): https://www.census.gov/quickfacts/fact/table/US/PST045224[3] Intended as upper bound as certainty there are some seniors on TikTok.[4] Unfortunately I think it is easy for bad actors to use whataboutism and that while I don't think you're doing this, bad actors try to snake in through claims like yours. Using the legitimacy of your claim to control the conversation and shift focus (the same way dog whistles are only intended to be heard by dogs).[5] DO NOT start with the most egregious, as that's too abstract and leads people to believe you're a conspiracy nut. Same shit as when talking about Snowden, it doesn't matter if you can show them the evidence, the claims appear more like that out of a movie than reality and it doesn't feel like we live in the dystopia where we see this kind of tech on screen.",

This is a bar too high. One should not need years or decades of expertise to take back what is a broad/universal desire.It comes down to consent. The users aren't technologically sophisticated enough to know how their data is being weaponized against them. Let's be honest here, even on places like HN we often see claims about \"ads don't affect me\" and \"I don't care if they want to sell me a better product\". As if 1) you aren't affected, 2) it doesn't matter if your friends/family/peers are affected, and 3) that ads are just there to sell you products and exclusively ones that make your life better. How the information is being leveraged is too abstract for most people and it takes time to process it.The advertisers literally take advantage of this fact.But where I do agree is that we need to make our voices heard. The barrier is too high for most to achieve. \"Install a pihole\" may be acceptable on HN[0] but not for the broader public and certainly is far from being a strong defense alone[1].Where I do agree is that we as developers need to make these tools easier to use and help lead those conversations and help educate people.But if you are saying the solution is \"git gud, protect yourself\" then I think you are on the wrong side and even harming yourself. Unfortunately internet privacy is like vaccinations, we require herd immunity. Without those around you protecting their privacy, your privacy is at risk. It is not a personal decision, it is a social one.[0] And is the average HN user actually going to implement encrypted DNS and know how to pick better DNS servers? Or are we just going to argue about the trustworthyness of 1.1.1.1 vs 9.9.9.9? Are we even going to talk about things like 1.1.1.2 or base.dns.mullvad.net? These are still the basics![1] How many people know you need to change your browser settings? That your browser is likely picking a DNS server for you.",

Where there was a strong political push of \"don't trust the experts\". He criticizes claims that sound familiar today \"America has a right to know\" on the basis of this being meaningless without literacy. He clarifies that literacy is far more than being able to actually read words on a page, but to interpret and process them. Asimov isn't being pretentious, his definition is consistent with how we determine reading levels[2] and his critique would be that most people do not have that of a Freshman in High School. Hell, it is even in his fiction! It is even in The Foundation and is literally the premise of Profession[3].Feynman is a bit more scattered, but I think his discussion about the education system in Brazil (in the 50's) says a lot[4]. He talks a lot about how the students could recite the equations, ace all the tests, and achieve everything that looks to be, at least on paper, perfectly academic; but how the students did not really have the deeper understanding of the equations. It is a discussion about literacy. Were he around today I'm sure he'd use the phrase \"metric hacking\". Anyone that knows Feynman may also be thinking about his Cargo Cult Science[5](a commencement speech at Cal Tech (1974)). This is where his famous quote  The first principle is that you must not fool yourself--and you are the easiest person to fool. So you have to be very careful about that. \n\ncomes from.

I struggled with his wording, and in the end found myself unable to sign—not because I thought astrology has any validity whatever, but because I felt (and still feel) that the tone of the statement was authoritarian. It criticized astrology for having origins shrouded in superstition. But this is true as well for religion, chemistry, medicine, and astronomy, to mention only four. The issue is not what faltering and rudimentary knowledge astrology came from, but what is its present validity....The statement stressed that we can think of no mechanism by which astrology could work. This is certainly a relevant point but by itself it’s unconvincing. No mechanism was known for continental drift (now subsumed in plate tectonics) when it was proposed by Alfred Wegener in the first quarter of the twentieth century to explain a range of puzzling data in geology and paleontology. (Ore-bearing veins of rocks and fossils seemed to run continuously from Eastern South America to West Africa; were the two continents once touching and the Atlantic Ocean new to our planet?) The notion was roundly dismissed by all the great geophysicists, who were certain that continents were fixed, not floating on anything, and therefore unable to “drift.” Instead, the key twentieth-century idea in geophysics turns out to be plate tectonics; we now understand that continental plates do indeed float and “drift” (or better, are carried by a kind of conveyor belt driven by the great heat engine of the Earth’s interior), and all those great geophysicists were simply wrong.

They benefit from the land speculation and the work from others.I don't really have a solution except that I can see that the landlords benefit from scarcity, and their leverage and ability to raise rents would be lessened if there was more viable retail spaces to take advantage of.So the city could help retailers by dramatically liberalizing retail zoning and allowing more competitive high streets to develop. This could take the edge off being forced to move by a landlord jacking up rent.",

It actually takes a decent amount of work and capital input to get a set of retail buildings into usable shape and keep them that way. The internet caricature of landlords is that the buildings just popped into existence one day and the landlords rent them out, but there's obviously more to it. I know several attempts at retail real estate development that flopped and lost investors a lot of money.There's also a risk involved in renting out the properties. Not all tenants will pay the rent, and when they stop paying for long enough you have to evict. It takes a long time to get someone's business out and turn the property over so a new business can move in. The rents have to be adjusted to compensate for some of that loss, but in a downturn (e.g. COVID) the losses can all sync up at once and torpedo the financial model used by the landlord.Retail spaces also need to be kept up. It's common in my area for groups to buy out blocks of spaces and overhaul the old parking lots, landscaping, lighting, traffic patterns, and security so that they go from being sketchy run-down locations to something safe and inviting.I'll probably get downvoted for trying to add some balance to the conversation because this is an internet comment section and my comment wasn't \"landlords bad\", but retail property investment isn't really a magical safe investment like everyone assumes.

Combine that with UBI or some other means to redistribute that captured value and literally the only “losers” in this scenario are the landlords (and only to the extent that they'd no longer make money on renting out land; slashing the building tax to zero would make those landlords less disincentivized to maintain and upgrade their buildings).",

The problem we're in is that there's a general shortage and so in many places, losing a long held apartment is like an existential crisis because everywhere else is even more expensive and there's a shortage.Another approach is that in redeveloping \"cool\" areas we could increase land/property taxes and developer fees so as to recapture the land lift and divert toward public realm projects that benefit existing long time residents. The area becoming cool and getting new condos pays for the new pool and new below market housing.Should be mentioned as an aside that the actions themselves of poor people can ultimately gentrify a neighbourhood just as much as retail. A neighbourhood can become known for a vibrant arts/music scene that ultimately gentrifies it not just because it has some bars, but because the working artist residents are they themselves creating the attracting works in putting on events and shows. They earn a meagre income as working artists but ultimately may displace themselves as condos come advertising themselves on the scene that they've created.Cyclical neighbourhood change I think is inevitable so I think what we really need to focus on is not necessarily finding ways to keep neighbourhoods the same, but giving people and retailers options so that when change happens, it's not disruptive and painful.",

Being a tiny minority they have no hope to influence their governments because the opposite position is widely popular.Therefore, they try to convince commercial entities to disregard these laws as much as possible. This is particularly useful for that niche since fighting legislation cannot in itself be done anonymously. Therefore, they attempt to transform a very nonymous (haha) entity to do the fighting on their behalf. If the attempt fails, no harm befalls them.I think it's a doomed endeavour. To get users on discord, it has to be portrayed to parents as a safe and legal service. The days of underground BBSes are gone. Now, if your brand gets associated with anything negative you're toast. And realistically the anonymous users are kind of useless as a whole. They won't pay, so they're practically just a drag on your platform.

Moving to Persona for age verification involves verification data being sent outside of the user's phone - in direct contradiction to Discord's initial promise of keeping facial scan data solely on the phone.  Third parties that we've been given no reason to trust will delete the data without using it for an improper purpose such as creating derivative info from the ID or facial scan itself unrelated to the sole purpose of verifying that an individual is an adult.While we're at it - is there any legitimate reason why Discord is associating a person's actual or estimated age with their account as opposed to storing a value that states if they are or are not an adult?

Officials had recently given the FAA a 10-day window in which the technology would be used.The anti-drone technology was launched near the southern border to shoot down what appeared to be foreign drones. The flying material turned out to be a party balloon, sources said. One balloon was shot down, several sources said.The Mexican cartels have been running drones on the border lately, the sources said, but it was unclear how many were hit by the military's anti-UAS (unmanned aircraft systems) technology this week. One official said at least one cartel drone was successfully disabled.",

      "abstract": "该讨论围绕使用Python 3.14的ZSTD模块进行文本分类展开。核心话题是探讨压缩算法在机器学习分类任务中的可行性与局限性。有人认为直接使用压缩器进行机器学习存在疑问，因为压缩器与分类器的目标不同；也有用户指出，压缩与智能密切相关，并以自身研究为例，说明通过PNG文件大小分类模拟输出状态非常可靠。讨论中提到，ZSTD等压缩算法本质上是通过比较文档间的共同词汇和短语来实现分类，这并非完全无效。部分用户认为zlib等传统模块在速度上更具优势，并对Python引入ZSTD的实用性提出疑问。共识在于，压缩与概率建模存在直接关联，且基于压缩的方法在某些场景中简单有效；分歧则体现在对压缩算法在分类任务中的适用性及不同工具的性能比较上。此外，有用户联想到大语言模型本质也是无损压缩机器，引发了关于其与专业压缩算法效率对比的思考。",

          "content": "I'm doing my PhD in compression-based machine learning, wanted to contribute a few clarifying points.The relationship between probabilistic modeling and lossless compression is very direct. A model that predicts the next symbol with probability p can on average losslessly compress that symbol with the help of an entropy coder (e.g. arithmetic coding) in -log(p) bits. Therefore improved probabilistic models immediately translate into improved lossless compressors.There are two ways people have used compressors for ML: the first is based on the Minimum Description Length (MDL) principle [0] which says that the best model is the one which provides the shortest description of the data, counting the size of the model itself. This is similar to the technique used in this blog post (argmin code length across class-conditioned compressors) except for counting the model size. Basically you can train a compressor per class and then choose the class compressor which best compresses the test data. It is a maximum likelihood argument because of Shannon's source coding theorem: a code length L corresponds to a probability 2^-L. The second way is the Normalized Compression Distance (NCD) [1], which uses code lengths to calculate information-theoretic distances which can then be plugged into distance-based algorithms like kNN. MDL interprets compressed lengths as likelihoods, while NCD interprets them for distance calculations. The theoretical foundation is Kolmogorov complexity which is the ideal (& uncomputable) lossless compressor, used to define information distance, an \"ideal\" distance metric based on algorithmic similarity.Data compression is not in principle restricted to syntactic similarity. As others have mentioned, the new wave of neural compressors (e.g. NNCP [2], CMIX [3], leading the large text compression benchmark [4]) outperform their traditional counterparts (e.g. gzip) because of the ability of neural networks to learn complex semantic patterns. Their improved ability to predict the next token means improved lossless compression. This has also been shown to be the case with pre-trained LLMs [5].I think it's neat that improving compression improves machine learning, and improving machine learning improves compression!Looking forward to hearing other thoughts.[0] https://arxiv.org/abs/math/0406077\n[1] https://arxiv.org/abs/cs/0111054\n[2] https://bellard.org/nncp/nncp_v2.pdf\n[3] https://www.byronknoll.com/cmix.html\n[4] https://www.mattmahoney.net/dc/text.html\n[5] https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.10668",

I did a really naive version that tokenizes the input, feeds the max context window up to the token being encoded into an LLM, and uses that to produce a distribution of likely next tokens, then encodes the actual token with Huffman Coding with the LLM's estimated distribution. I could get better results with arithmetic encoding almost certainly.It outperforms zstd by a long shot (I haven't dedicated the compute horsepower to figuring out what \"a long shot\" means quantitatively with reasonably small confidence intervals) on natural language, like wikipedia articles or markdown documents, but (using GPT-2) it's about as good as zstd or worse than zstd on things like files in the Kubernetes source repository.You already get a significant amount of compression just out of the tokenization in some cases (\"The quick red fox jumps over the lazy brown dog.\" encodes to one token per word plus one token for the '.' for the GPT-2 tokenizer), where as with code a lot of your tokens will just represent a single character so the entropy coding is doing all the work, which means your compression is only as good as the accuracy of your LLM, plus the efficiency of your entropy coding.I would need to be encoding multiple tokens per \"word\" with Huffman Coding to hit the entropy bounds, since it has a minimum of one bit per character, so if tokens are mostly just one byte then I can't do better than a 12.5% compression ratio with one token per word. And doing otherwise gets computationally infeasible very fast. Arithmetic coding would do much better especially on code because it can encode a word with fractional bits.I used Huffman coding for my first attempt because it's easier to implement and most libraries don't support dynamically updating the distribution throughout the process.",

No wonder why so many people are befriending AIs and there's a \"loneliness epidemic\" going around.When it comes to physical communities (e.g. neighborhoods), I think about some neighborhoods in São Paulo that are being destroyed by buildings and construction sites everywhere [1]. So many neighborhoods full of stories and friendships and people who took care of each other, now becoming part of this massive verticalization, speculation and isolation. Neighbors have to leave due to construction companies' harassment. The ones that decide to stay have to live without their friends around, in neighborhoods that grow more dangerous, with worse traffic, with less small businesses and without knowing who are their new neighbors (which aren't even long term living). Their houses look exactly like Carl Fredricksen's house from Pixar's Up.When it comes to digital communities, I can only be reminded of how Orkut and MSN defined lots of adolescences in Latin America. Orkut literally had the concept of communities, where people gathered around similar interests (just as the early web's forums). I made a lot of friends in Orkut and MSN Messenger, some of them are still my friends after more than a decade. Facebook tried to recreate the idea of communities (with their groups), but Facebook is pretty much dead for younger people. And Instagram is just so isolating. It has a whole lot of standardized and algorithmically curated content that alienates you from other human beings.I believe the reason why Orkut (owned by Google) was killed was that they wanted more users, maybe to compete with Facebook. But Orkut was too localized, it basically talked to Brazil and some other countries in Latin America, and India, where it was created. After killing Orkut, Google invested a lot on Google+ (do you remember that fiasco??).[1] https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CCIQoN0fUE0",

The pre-human state definitionally could never be recreated (or maintained) by human hands, it will always reflect the contributions of its human stewards. So if conservation is fundamentally impossible, what's the real goal of conservation ecology? Is it doomed to simply create \"theme parks\"? Or can we be said to meaningfully preserve something (even if it's a changed or debased form of the original). Conservation ecology is what happens when these stupid philosophical musings bump into actual engineers willing to try to do it.Human communities (even digital ones) ultimately have the character of an ecological system IMO (albeit in a more allegorical sense). What the author calls fungibility I might call conservation; weird Twitter accounts \"migrating\" to Bluesky is sort of like pandas surviving primarily in zoos. Some element of the original system is kept, but ultimately the \"conservation\" is more like \"recreation\" or \"homage\" rather than truly freezing the system in amber. Does that mean that it's futile to try? Or is there some sense in which we can have meaningful translation of the relationship web from one medium to the next? Maybe we don't even care about maintaining the system; if it's just the biodiversity we prize then maybe pandas in zoos forever is enough.I don't think this is adding anything new to what the author is saying per se, but I find the parallels interesting to muse about.",

In \"Twitter And Teargas\", Zeynep Tufecki argued that the community afforded by Twitter was unable to effect long term, substantial change and therefore Arab Spring is now a footnote. Twitter affords flash mobs.That concept - affordance - provides a hint for a model of communities. The obvious question to a hacker is \"what kind of social system would afford long term substantial change?\".Another insight is that the afforded mechanisms determine the community. This is really a restatement of the Sapir-Whorf hyptothesis. From \"your language determines what you can think\" to \"your social mechanisms determine your community\". Roughly.Another insight (corollary?) for  Sapir-Whorf is that your language prevents you from thinking some things. So one could try to understand what \"following\" as a social mechanism prevents prevents?Out of this kind of analysis emerges a different take on communities all together. For the hacker in us, John Holland's \"Hidden Order\" provides a generalized model that can be used to at least create a pseudo model for creating a simulation of the community mechanism.Although John Holland talks about Complex Adaptive Systems, I personally find \"Gestalt\" a less cumbersome and effective term. A gestalt is something greater than the sum of it's parts and that can only be true(ish) when the parts interact. So entities + rules + message bus => Gestalt. For ants this is {ants + ant behavior + pheromone trails } => ant colonies. One could conjecture that for humans this could be {people + behavior + money } => economies. Or more cynically => corporations.The complexity and emergent behavior of the {rules + message/bus part} part is probably best revealed by Wolfram's \"A New Kind of Science\".This is an incredibly important talking for our time. What is the most effective way to get rid of ants? To destroy their ability to use a pheromone trail. Perhaps we could just put advertising in it?[edit: forgot the Wolfram reference.

It depends which models you’re looking at and what their purpose is.\nThere is substantial economic research on:\nSocial capital (e.g., Putnam, though he’s political science adjacent; economists like Glaeser formalize it)\nNetwork effects and network structure\nRepeated games and reputation\nReligious participation and club goods (Iannaccone’s work is central here)\nIdentity economics (Akerlof & Kranton)\nTrust and informal institutions\nHousehold bargaining models\nMatching theory, where who you match with specifically mattersI think the fact that communities are not fungible is frankly obvious.

Building something where something already exists does carry a cost.But I can also see how this will be used as one more arrow in the quiver of NIMBYs. In addition to environmental, economic, political reasons not to build something, also consider the cost to potentially breaking existing community bonds. We shouldn’t build new high density housing because the new residents will never be able to replicate the community of the previous low density single family home neighbourhood.You can tell this is a NIMBY piece because it doesn’t touch on how to build new communities, just that existing ones exist and new ones can’t be built and even if they can they’ll be poor imitations of the old ones. So instead of trying to build new things, let’s preserve what we have already. It would have been more interesting and honest if it had explored the role of say, third spaces and how consciously creating the right conditions can lead to community formation.After all, even the communities that exist today were empty land once upon a time, until we built the infrastructure and community within.

Perhaps we could just put advertising in it?I'm taking this analogy for myself :)> what kind of social system would afford long term substantial change?In my experience over the last year, these things are true...First, in-person interaction is strictly better than digital. You can meet lots of people digitally and talk to them in bed, but _interacting_ with a given person face-to-face means you can do any digital interaction, plus have very high-bandwidth communication, and also share papers. (I love paper. It's not obsolete if you know what a Pareto frontier is.) This is something that many people understand intuitively but it took me a while to quantify it.Second, digital (text) communication affords bickering. In the best case, if I'm DMing a friend and we disagree about some political point, it will make the conversation awkward. If I'm in a big group chat, it can drag people into a dogpile. It's an emotional drain and nobody really likes it. And it doesn't happen nearly as much in person. Even with the exact same people. Even I am nicer and more patient in person. And being able to physically leave and see someone later is a nice option that digital spaces (even Signal) don't afford. They only understand permanent blocks and not just \"Tell me your dumb take another time.\"Third, you can just say \"I'm trying to build community and make friends, can I introduce you to some people you might like?\" and in the right context and framing, it can sort of work. I am still learning this skill.Fourth, and I almost forgot - A _huge_ amount of nonverbal communication comes down to trust and respect, especially respecting other people's time. Did you call a 50-person meeting where 1 person is yammering about some bikeshed bullshit? Everyone hates that. Are you talking to someone one-on-one but they still won't give you a turn or ask you anything about yourself? They might be a good person but they're gonna be hard to get along with if they keep that up. Did you send someone a blog post that takes 5 minutes to read? And they didn't ask for it? They aren't gonna read it. I wouldn't read it. You would have more luck reading it out loud to them in person because it shows that you are both respecting each other's time. Otherwise you are assigning homework and asking their attention without paying your attention to them. I can't name a person who likes that.",

I can't think of anybody that got lost, and it was actually an improvement because the new discussion infrastructure was better than it had been before. The community didn't scatter to the winds, far from it; it consolidated and grew.Of course, such a situation is probably rarer with the enshittification these days, but it would be worth it to figure out when it works, too.And history is replete with stories of groups who became most successful AFTER a migration, or at least were not so negatively affected by one.",

Building one that works, that has sufficient network effects, auditability, accountability, enforcability, so that when things are maliciously exploited, or people make mistakes, your system is robust and resilient - these are profound technically difficult challenges.The US government effectively has to operate IDs under a web of trust, with 50 units sitting at the top, and a around 3,000 county sub-units, each of which are handling anywhere from 0 to 88 sub-units of towns, cities, other community structures.Each community then deals with one or more hospitals, one or more doctors in each hospital, and every time a baby is born, they get some paperwork filled out, filed upward through the hierarchy of institutions, shared at the top level between the massive distributed database of social security numbers, and there are laws and regulations and officials in charge of making sure each link in the chain is where it needs to be and operates according to a standard protocol.At any rate - ID is hard. You've gotta have rules and enforcement, accountability and due process, transparency and auditing, and you end up with something that looks a bit like a ledger or a blockchain. Getting a working blockchain running is almost trivial at this point, or building on any of the myriad existing blockchains. The hard part is the network incentives. It can't be centralized - no signing up for an account on some website. Federated or domain based ID can be good, but they're too technical and dependent on other nations and states. The incentives have to line up, too; if it's too low friction and easy, it'll constantly get exploited and scammed at a low level. If it's too high friction and difficult, nobody will want to bother with it.Absent a compelling reason to participate, people need to be compelled into these ID schemes, and if they're used for important things, they need a corresponding level of enforcement, and force, backing them up, with due process. You can't run it like a gmail account, because then it's not reliable as a source of truth, and so on.I don't know if there's a singular, technological fix, short of incorruptible AGI that we can trust to run things for us following an explicit set of rules, with protocols that allow any arbitrary independent number of networks and nodes and individuals to participate.",

And in Kancheepuram's case it's an extremely important industry in TN.Furthemore, if Prada or Chanel buys Indian heritage artisan goods and gives it the luxury veneer, it helps MSMEs and khadi cooperatives demand better terms when wholesaling light manufactured products.Finally, at a personal level, much of my family is associated with Khadi and Cooperative industries - they are one of the only ways to build medium or even high value industries while giving participants some degree of agency. The profits of khadi goods being sold at high margins ends up in the hands of cooperative members and cooperatives tend to re-invest in capacity building or subsidizing new entrants.

No please.The buyer of a Kanjeevaram (or Paithani, or Navvari, or Balucheri, or any number of other traditions) is looking for something outside of time.
