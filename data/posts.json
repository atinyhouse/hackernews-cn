      "abstract": "该讨论围绕美国政府新版饮食指南展开，核心争议在于指南是否受到肉类加工行业游说影响，以及“高度加工食品”这一概念的合理性。多数用户认同指南强调“吃天然食物”的方向，认为高蛋白、低碳水饮食对健康有益，且有用户分享该饮食改善自身疾病的经验。\n\n争议点主要集中在两方面：一是行业影响问题，有用户指出肉类企业通过游说团体影响指南制定，使牛肉、禽肉占据突出位置，而豆类、豆腐等植物蛋白被忽视；二是加工食品定义，部分用户认为“高度加工”是缺乏科学依据的流行词，指出巴氏杀菌、急冻等技术有益健康，问题在于食品设计目标而非加工本身。讨论中也有用户担忧当前政府削减食品药品监管预算可能影响指南落实效果。",

Also improves lean mass (muscle) retention during weight loss.- Processed foods have lower satiety per calorie, and hence can lead to the same outcomes described above.- Most people can benefit from eating more fruit and veggies. (Lots of people who change to vegetarian inadvertently eat significantly fewer calories because the food is not calorie dense)The one glaring part I have a hard time reconciling is:- This new Real Food guide seems like it's going to increase people's saturated fat intake, which is not good.

Even focusing on CO2 emissions by industry avoids the elephant of the room of the insane levels of methane produced by cows, a gas that's 200 times more harmful.There is little evidence that a meat heavy diet is good for people, but there's plenty of evidence of the contrary.So, to be honest, while I don't freak out and I'm all for freedom, there has to be also some kind of consciousness into how do we use the resources on this planet, and diet is by far more impactful than the transport of choice.",

In fact they had a hilariously easy time adapting to the consumer trend because all they had to do to label a cow “free range” or “grass fed” was change the finishing stage to a lower density configuration instead of those abominable feed lots you see along highways. The first two stages, rearing and pasturing, didn’t change because they were already “free range” and “grass fed”. Half of the farmland in the US is pastureland and leaving animals in the field to eat grass was always the cheapest way to rear and grow them. They only really get fed corn and other food at the end to fatten them up for human consumption.The dirty not-so-secret is that free range/grass fed cows eat almost the exact same diet as regular cows, they just eat a little more grass  because they’re in the field more during finishing. They’re still walking up to troughs of feed, because otherwise the beef would be unpalatable and grow quite slower.True grass fed beef is generally called “grass finished” beef and it’s unregulated so you won’t find it at a supermarket. They taste gamier and usually have a metallic tang that I quite honestly doubt would ever be very popular. The marbling is also noticeably different and less consistent. Grain finished beef became popular in the 1800s and consumers in the West have strongly preferred it since.I’m not sure you can even find a cow in the entire world that isn’t “grass fed”.

A recent study shows that on any given day, just 12% of people in the US account for half of all beef consumed in the US.> Men and people between the ages of 50 and 65 were more likely to be in what the researchers dubbed as “disproportionate beef eaters”, defined as those who, based on a recommended daily 2,200 calorie-diet, eat more than four ounces – the rough equivalent of more than one hamburger – daily. The study analyzed one-day dietary snapshots from over 10,000 US adults over a four-year period. White people were among those more likely to eat more beef, compared with other racial and ethnic groups like Black and Asian Americans.

Seems partisan spite cuts both ways.I'm glad to see this announcement and despite the leadership in Washington right now I don't think these adjustment will be seen as too controversial by the American public. The recommendations are based on a lot of good nutritional science that's been out there for years, but the buck seems to stop at the conversation around fat.They went to great lengths to remove the debate around good fat vs bad fat from this discussion. Even reading the report, emphasis is put on the discussion of why we use so many pressed oils in the food chain, but not why we phased lard and shortening out of the American diet.\"Eat real butter\" is ostensibly a recommendation presented at the bottom of the webpage, but butter is not a healthy fat. Same with some people's obsession with frying in beef tallow, but the report doesn't want to dig into this distinction for obvious self interested reasons. They even recommend:> When cooking with or adding fats to meals, prioritize oils with essential fatty\nacids, such as olive oil. Other options can include butter or beef tallow.Which is a good recommendation. But no, you don't want to replace olive oil with butter or beef tallow. There's a lot of good nutrition science to back this up, but the report would prefer to not go there. Maybe \"eat some butter\" is appropriate, but unless the FDA wants to have an honest conversation around HDL and LDL cholesterol and saturated fats, I don't see this inverted pyramid doing too much good for overall population health (besides raising awareness)",

He’s bypassing the regulator and putting a gun to the government’s head regarding national prestige and infrastructure security.My personal take idea likely outcome: Cloudflare wins.EU Law: The order almost certainly violates the Digital Services Act (DSA) regarding general monitoring obligations and country-of-origin principles.\nRealpolitik: The Italian government can't risk the Olympics infrastructure getting DDoS'd into oblivion because AGCOM picked a fight they can't win. They will likely settle for a standard, court-ordered geo-block down the road, but the idea of Cloudflare integrating with a broken 30-minute takedown API is dead on arrival.",

Every Italian arcade has remained more or less frozen in time ever since, with the occasional addition of games modded to state on the title screen that they are a completely different cabinet (such as the infamous \"Dance Dance Revolution NAOMI Universal\") in an attempt to get around the certification requirements.",

Gas to get you from point A to point B is ~$5, and there's a floor on what you can pay the driver. If your ride costs $8 today, you know that's unsustainable; it'll eventually climb to $10 or $12.But inference costs are dropping dramatically over time, and that trend shows no signs of slowing. So even if a task costs $8 today thanks to VC subsidies, I can be reasonably confident that the same task will cost $8 or less without subsidies in the not-too-distant future.Of course, by then we'll have much more capable models. So if you want SOTA, you might see the jump to $10-12. But that's a different value proposition entirely: you're getting significantly more for your money, not just paying more for the same thing.",

They are all hamstrung by the fact that the task is impossible, and they aren’t allowed to provide commentary to that effect. Objectively, 4 failed to follow the prompts in 4/10 cases and made nonsense changes in the other 6; 4.1 made nonsense changes; and 5 made nonsense changes (based on the apparently incorrect guess that the missing ‘index_value’ column was supposed to hold the value of the index).",

Questions were asked of the humans and they answered with their knowledge from the real world and years of experience.If no one asks humans anymore, they just ask LLMs, then no new discussions between humans are occurring online and that experience doesn't get syndicated in a way models can train on.That is essentially the entirety of Stack Overflows existence until now.

For me, productivity gains are mostly in areas where I don't have expertise (but the downside, of course, is I don't learn much if I let AI do the work) or when I know it's a throwaway thing and I absolutely don't care about the quality. For example, I'm bedtime reading a series of books for my daughter, and one of them doesn't have a Polish translation, and the Polish publisher stopped working with the author. I vibe coded an app that will extract an epub, translate each of the chapters, and package it back to an epub, with a few features like: saving the translations in sqlite, so the translation can be stopped and resumed, ability to edit translations, add custom instructions etc. It's only ~1000 lines of Rust code, but Claude generated it when I was doing dinner (I just checked progress and prompted next steps every few minutes). I can guarantee that it would take me at least an evening of coding, probably debugging problems along the way, to make it work. So while I know it's limited in a way it still lacks in certain scenarios (novel code in niche technology, very big projects etc), it is kinda game changer in other scenarios. It lets me do small tools that I just wouldn't have time to do otherwise.So I guess what I'm saying is, even with all the limitations, I kinda understand the hype. That said, I think some people may indeed exaggerate LLMs capabilities, unless they actually know some secret recipe to make them do all those awesome hyped things (but then I would love to see that).",

Over time the MD file gets large, but the error rate plummets.4) This is where it drifts from being treated as a standard Junior. YOU must manually verify that the unit tests are testing for the right thing. I usually add a rule to the MD file telling it not to touch them after I'm happy with them, but even then you must also now check that the agent didn't change them the first time it hit a bug.

Given that phones are the default computing device for most people these days and how (relatively) easily secrets can be extracted from rooted devices, blanket-banning them makes a lot of sense.Nonetheless, modern Android is just as locked down as modern iOS, with a few exceptions (like adb access) and without the awesome hardware and software optimizations for that hardware that make video recording fast and web browsing even faster.

I dunno. But they really want you to use the Claude Code™ CLI with that subscription, not the open-source OpenCode CLI. They want OpenCode users to pay API prices, which could be 5x or more.So, of course, OpenCode has implemented a workaround, so that folks paying \"only\" $200/month can use their preferred OpenCode CLI at Anthropic's all-you-can-eat token buffet.https://github.com/anomalyco/opencode/issues/7410#issuecomme...Everything about this is ridiculous, and it's all Anthropic's fault. Anthropic shouldn't have an all-you-can-eat plan for $200 when their pay-as-you-go plan would cost more than $1,000+ for comparable usage. Their subscription plans should just sell you API credits at, like, 20% off.More importantly, Anthropic should have open sourced their Claude Code CLI a year ago.

Regardless of what they say you're paying the subscription for, the truth is the only thing of value to developers is the underlying AI and API.I can only think of few reasons why they'd do this:\n1. Their Claude Code tool is not simply an agent assistant - perhaps it's feeding data for model training purposes, or something of the sorts where they gain value from it.\n2. They don't want developers to use competitor models in any capacity.\n3. They're offloading processing or doing local context work to drive down the API usage locally, making the usage minimal. This is very unlikely.I currently use Opus 4.5 for architecting, which then feeds into Gemini 3 Flash with medium reasoning for coding.

Claude Code工具并非单纯的智能体助手，或许在为模型训练收集数据，或通过其他方式从中获取价值。\n2. 他们不希望开发者以任何形式使用竞争对手的模型。\n3. 通过转移处理任务或本地上下文工作来降低API调用量，这种可能性极低。\n目前我使用Opus 4.5进行架构设计，再将结果导入Gemini 3 Flash进行中等复杂度的编码。谷歌迟早会推出与Opus 4.5竞争的产品，届时我对Anthropic将不再有任何忠诚度可言。"

Obviously, CC is a great tool, but that's more about the magic of the model than the engineering of the CLI.The opencode team[^1][^2] built an entire custom TUI backend that supports a good subset of HTML/CSS and the TypeScript ecosystem (i.e. not tied to Opencode, a generic TUI renderer). Then, they built the product as a client/server, so you can use the agent part of it for whatever you want, separate from the TUI. And THEN, since they implemented the TUI as a generic client, they could also build a web view and desktop view over the same server.It also doesn't flicker at 30 FPS whenever it spawns a subagent.That's just the tip of the iceberg. There are so many QoL features in opencode that put CC to shame. Again, CC is a magical tool, but the actual nuts and bolts engineering of it is pretty damning for \"LLMs will write all of our code soon\". I'm sorry, but I'm a decent-systems-programmer-but-terminal-moron and I cranked out a raymarched 3D renderer in the terminal for a Claude Wrapped[^] in a weekend that...doesn't flicker. I don't mean that in a look-at-me way. I mean that in a \"a mid-tier systems programmer isn't making these mistakes\" kind of way.Anyway, this is embarrassing for Anthropic. I get that opencode shouldn't have been authenticating this way. I'm not saying what they are doing is a rug pull, or immoral. But there's a reason people use this tool instead of your first party one. Maybe let those world class systems designers who created the runtime that powers opencode get their hands on your TUI before nicking something that is an objectively better product.[^1] https://github.com/anomalyco/opentui[^2] From my loose following of the development, not a monolith, and the person mostly responsible for the TUI framework is https://x.com/kmdrfx[^3] https://spader.zone/wrapped/",

OpenCode basically had to impersonate the official Claude Code client to make that work, and it always felt like a loophole that would get patched eventually.This is exactly why (when OpenCode and Charm/Crush started diverging) Charm chose not to support “use your Claude subscription” auth and went in a different direction (BYOK / multi-provider / etc). They didn’t want to build a product on top of a fragile, unofficial auth path.And I think there’s a privacy/policy reason tightening this now too: the recent Claude Code update (2.1-ish) pops a “Help improve Claude” prompt in the terminal. If you turn that ON, retention jumps from 30 days to up to 5 years for new/resumed chats/coding sessions (and data can be used for model improvement). If you keep it OFF, you stay on the default 30-day retention. You can also delete data anytime in settings. That consent + retention toggle is hard to enforce cleanly if you’re not in an official client flow, so it makes sense they’re drawing a harder line.",

The fallacy is that these companies underestimate the essential compexities of the higher-level and approach the problem with arrogance.That would seem to apply here.  Why should a model-building company have any unique skill at building higher-level integration?If their edge comes from having the best model, they should commoditize the complement and make it as easy as possible for everyone to use (and pay for) their model.  The standard API allows them to do just this, offering 'free' benefits from community integrations and multi-domain tasks.If their edge does not come from the model – if the models are interchangeable in performance and not just API – then the company will have deeper problems justifying its existing investments and securing more funding.

If they don't think so, then it's outrageous that he's been libelled in a such a manner. If they think he is a terrorist sympathizer then it would be outrageous to them that he is allowed to operate unimpeded in western society and its economic realm.That's why this comment sounds disingenously pedantic and your follow-up comment's detached tone doesn't feel sincere frankly.

          "content": "My view is that there is commodity software and niche/specialized software. You find commercial solutions for both. But OSS is great for commodity software.Everything becomes a commodity eventually. There's a lot of niche software that then goes mainstream, gets imitated by others, and becomes important to a wide range of sectors. A lot of that software usually ends up with very decent OSS alternatives. If it's worth having in OSS software form, usually somebody ends up working on it.A lot of OSS projects are already leaning heavily on contributions from individuals and companies inside the EU. That's a good thing for the EU and something to stimulate and build on.What the EU should do is keep an eye out for commodity software where it relies on non eu commercial software. Identify key areas where that is risky, e.g. communication software, IOT, or finance. And then stimulate members to switch to OSS alternatives if they exist and invest in the creation/support of such alternatives if they are important. OSS software doesn't just create itself, it needs backing from companies which could use the support in the form of grants.That could include support for non EU OSS projects. There's nothing wrong with OSS from abroad. As long as this software is properly governed and vital to the EU, the EU should ensure those projects are healthy and future proofed. It should ensure local software companies get the support they need to do the right things here. This should ensure projects that are important don't run out of funding. And the EU can stimulate OSS development into strategic new areas with incentives. And make sure that EU companies that back this are successful internationally. This turns the tables on other countries maybe depending more on EU sourced software. The EU doesn't have to follow; it can lead.",

Let's say there's an app that stores healthcare data in an EU compliant format, there's 3 possibilities:- Every country develops its own solution, which is good for employee demand, but can be inefficient- Every country standardizes on a proprietary solution. The problem will be that said solution will most likely come from one of the major EU countries (say Germany) and others will feel left out and forced to use that solution. Said solution will be Germany-first, so local demands will have to go a slow and expensive contracting process. Said company will sell access to APIs, meaning integrating and building innovation on top will be tied to that commercial entity- Every country uses the same standard software that's open source. There's no licensing fees, everyone can modify the code to accomodate local needs. Development costs are low. Proprietary local solution can be built on top without having to pay anyone.It's clear to me, that when the customer is the public, and open-source solution should be preferred.",

And they also profited from commercial software that implemented their proprietary protocols.That worked (for the company hired)for taxes and they made billions. But for other stuff like medical, when they had no way to sell their proprietary standards they wasted billions and years of time and delivered nothing.

The documentation is available here: SoundTouch API Documentation (https://assets.bosecreative.com/m/496577402d128874/original/...).AFAIK, the soundtouch web API was already accessible via some bose developer portal. It doesn't seem like they are open sourcing anything. This API just allows you to make basic requests to do things like change volume on the speaker.To support the smart features of the SoundTouch speakers, we would the soundtouch user management service. Speakers connect to this very frequently and its where refresh tokens for music services and presets are stored. The speaker firmware itself has lots of source code, including the bit to handle music services and playback. There is an abstraction layer for music service APIs. There is a process on the speaker that reaches out to a music service registry, which is an index of bose music service adapters. Each of these adapters essentially proxies a music service like tunein, spotify, and even the \"stream a custom station\" feature.If bose open-sourced the speaker firmware, we could make a firmware build which talks to a 3rd party user management service, and reaches out to a 3rd party music service registry. Then we could add and maintain music service playback for the community. But there is no open sourcing of any actual code here and this soundtouch web api cannot change the URLs on the existing firmware of the user management service or the music service registry.So to my eye this story seems misleading and just some PR nonsense.

Obviously nobody wanted that feature, but it was hella cool that it worked. Oh, and you could make Skype calls from across the room, and the microphone array lived up to Skype's tough certification requirements which took weeks of testing in Microsoft's anechoic chamber for the DSP/algorithm team to fine tune.I tried to push for open-sourcing the platform but it was tricky because 1) the director of engineering in Harman didn't know what open source meant and for a hardware focused business to understand the value was a hard sell, 2) it used a HW module that came with a SW stack I mostly got rid off but a few parts were remaining that would need to be replaced which would require additional resources, 3) I was burned out at that point and had limited energy left to fight the good fight. Really too bad, it could have been a cool voice agent development platform, and I honestly think it would have sold in large volumes as a developer-friendly device.Glad you like it, sorry about the remaining Bluetooth bugs nobody got around to fix, since it basically flopped instantly.",

A preset is used to set and recall a specific music stream supported by the SoundTouch speakerThere's a GET method that returns information about presets. Presumably you'd use a POST or PUT method to manage the presents. To that end, under POST, it says:> POST: N/AIt looks like this API basically allows you to control it like an dumb speaker. That's not nothing, but it's not much either.There doesn't seem to be anything in the API about controlling how the speak communicates with a back end service.Edit:Having some time to read over your [2] and the link to [0] it looks like getting root on the speaker w/ physical access is ridiculously easy. Booting the unit w/ a FAT32 USB drive attached with a file named \"remote_services\" in an otherwise empty root directory opens up an ssh server and the root user has no password.The comments on [0] have some interesting tidbits in them, too.These speakers look like they might be fun to play with and once Bose kills the back end people may unload them cheap.[0] https://flarn2006.blogspot.com/2014/09/hacking-bose-soundtou...",

It is praiseworthy, but it is unfortunate that it is.Seeing that, I expected the ability to build and run a custom firmware, like with an Android device with its bootloader unlocked. But it is not that, and they didn't open source their app either.What they did is that they removed dependence on their servers, and opened their device to be controlled by third party apps. That is, they let users use their device past its end of life, including when the first party app will stop being maintained, but not to the point of letting user add features.In understand why they would do that, they don't want users to backport features only available on their latest models that are sold at a premium, therefore competing against themselves. After all, the value in smart speakers is not the sound producing device, which I think is a problem that has been solved more than a decade ago at the consumer level, it is all about software features.",

My main gripe is that the battery life is very bad, and it has a 165 watt charger, which wont work on most planes. So if you fly a lot for work, this laptop will die on you unless you bring a lower wattage charger.  It also doesn't sleep properly. I often find it in my bag hours after closing it and the fans are going at full blast. It should have a 4th usb port (like the smaller version!).

I think having it pervade products in a much more subtle way is the future though.For example, if you close a youtube browser tab with a comment half written it will pop up an `alert(\"You will lose your comment if you close this window\")`. It does this if the comment is a 2 page essay or \"asdfasdf\". Ideally the alert would only happen if the comment seemed important but it would readily discard short or nonsensical input. That is really difficult to do in traditional software but is something an LLM could do with low effort. The end result is I only have to deal with that annoying popup when I really am glad it is there.That is a trivial example but you can imagine how a locally run LLM that was just part of the SDK/API developers could leverage would lead to better UI/UX. For now everyone is making the LLM the product, but once we start building products with an LLM as a background tool it will be great.It is actually a really weird time, my whole career we wanted to obfuscate implementation and present a clean UI to end users, we want them peaking behind the curtain as little as possible.

LLM models _do not_ fit into 4MB of SRAM :).And LLM inference is heavily memory bandwidth bound (reading input tokens isn't though - so it _could_ be useful for this in theory, but usually on device prompts are very short).So if you are memory bandwidth bound anyway and the NPU doesn't provide any speedup on that front, it's going to be no faster. But has loads of other gotchas so no real \"SDK\" format for them.Note the idea isn't bad per se, it has real efficiencies when you do start getting compute bound (eg doing multiple parallel batches of inference at once), this is basically what TPUs do (but with far higher memory bandwidth).",

For power users doing really hefty stuff they usually have a GPU anyway so that gets used because it's typically much faster. That's exactly what happens with my AMD AI Max 395+ board. I thought maybe the GPU and NPU could work in parallel but memory limitations mean that's often slower than just using the GPU alone.

The article backs this up by listing the many niches in which its found support, and I personally have deployed dozens of projects (both personal and professional) that use Wasm as a core component.I''m personally a big fan of Wasm; it has been one of my favorite technologies ever since the first time I called malloc from the JS console when experimenting with an early version of Emscripten. Modern JS engines can be almost miraculously fast, but Wasm still offers the best performance and much higher levels of control over what's actually running on the CPU. I've written about this in the past.The only way it really fell short is in the way that a lot of people were predicting that it would become a sort of total replacement for JS+HTML+CSS for building web apps. In this regard, I'd have to agree. It could be the continued lack of DOM bindings that have been considered a key missing piece for several years now, or maybe something else or more fundamental.I've tried out some of the Wasm-powered web frameworks like Yew and not found them to provide an improvement for me at all. It just feels like an awkwardly bolted-on layer on top of JS and CSS without adding any new patterns or capabilities. Like you still have to keep all of the underlying semantics of the way JS events work, you still have to keep the whole DOM and HTML element system, and you also have to deal with all the new stuff the framework introduces on top of that.Things may be different with other frameworks like Blazor which I've not tried, but I just find myself wanting to write JS instead. I openly admit that it might just be my deep experience and comfort building web apps using React or Svelte though.Anyway, I strongly feel that Wasm is a successful technology. It's probably in a lot more places than you think, silently doing its job behind the scenes. That, to me, is a hallmark of success for something like Wasm.",

React, the defacto UI framework for Javascript has a lot of web assembly components. A lot of the npm ecosystem has quietly brought in web assembly. And a lot of UI stuff gets packaged up as web components these days; some of that uses WASM as well.If you pulled the plug on WASM, a lot would stop working and it would heavily impact much of the JS frontend world.What hasn't caught on is modern UI frameworks that are native wasm. We have plenty of old ones that can be made to work via WASM but it's not the same thing. They are desktop UI toolkits running in a browser. The web is still stuck with CSS and DOM trees. And that's one of the areas where WASM is still a bit weak because it requires interfacing with the browser APIs via javascript. This is a fixable problem. But for now that's relatively slow and not very optimal.Solutions are coming. But that's not going to happen overnight. But web frontend teams being able to substitute Javascript for something else is going to require more work. Mobile frontend developers cross compiling to web is becoming a thing though. Jetbrain's compose multiplatform is has native Android/IOS supported now with a canvas rendered web frontend supported in Beta currently.You can actually drive the dom from WASM. There are some RUST frameworks. I've dabbled with using kotlin's wasm support to talk to browser dom APIs. It's not that hard. It's just that Rust is maybe not ideal (too low level/hard) for frontend work and a lot of languages lack frameworks that target low level browser APIs. That's going to take years to fix. But a lot compiles to wasm at this point. And you kind of have access to most of the browser APIs when you do. Even if there is a little performance penalty.",

For many, things are moving too quickly and in the wrong direction.Most Wasm proposals are very elegantly designed and effective - meaning they provide lots of value for relatively minor specification bloat. Examples are tail-calls, multi-value, custom-page-sizes, memory64 and even gc.However, the simd and flexible-simd increased spec bloat by a lot, are not future-proof and caused more fragmentation due to non-determinism. In my opinion work should have focused on flexible-vector (SVE-like) which was more aligned to Wasm's original goals of near-native performance.  The reason for this development was that simd was simpler to implement and thus users could reap benefits earlier. Unfortunately, it seems the existence of simd completely stalled development of the superior flexible-vectors proposal.If flexible-vectors (or similar) will ever be stabilized eventually, we will end up in one of two (bad) scenarios:1) People will have to decide between simd and flexible-vectors for their compilation, depending on their target hardware which is totally against Wasm's original goals.2) The simd proposal will be mostly unused and deprecated.

So apart from defining the subset there is no extra work to do. On the other hand I'm sure there are JS limitations that you inherit. And probably your \"binaries\" are a bit larger than WASM. (But, I would guess, highly compressible.)I guess the good news is that you can still use this approach. Just that no one does, because WASM stole the thunder.

That is the holy grail for any technology that wants to be a widely adopted intermediary. While it is possible, you are layering hacks on hacks and begging that the next user won't break it all. Until my users can bring whatever they're using with them, the transition isn't really worth it, and writing my own wiring for every possible combination/need is quite unnecessary.

Better useful than something that will never have a chance of standardization.On the other spectrum, things like custom-page-sizes seems like a simple flexible solution but smells like an implementation nightmare if you already have a runtime since that really impacts things on a far deeper level (64k pages was probably a mistake, but reading up on the issues of emulating x86 with 4k vs 16k pages on Mac's kinda hints at how devious \"small\" things like that is), i'm not surprised if it never comes about as an offical part (only 3 runtimes supporting it so far).I can understand the need for tail-calls but at the same time it's also an annoying can of worms to implement into compilers that wasn't prepared (could have been a large part of why it took so long for Safari to support).wasm-gc really hit a real-world need (bindings did really suck.. they're better but not perfect now) but also comes in a bit half-assed in some respects (languages like C# needing workarounds to use it), same with memory64 being a real-world need.I can see different camps (popular/functional languages for gc,m-val and tail-calls), games (simd128, multithreading, memory64), embedded(flexible pages),etc all competing and having focus on what they want but all camps also need to understand that pushing _everything_ will be pushing the risks of the web (security) and in the end that's what wasm was for, providing a runtime to run non-JS code on the web.",

C# is a great language to write domain code in. A lot of companies like C# for their backends so you get same-language sharing between backend and frontend. The Razor syntax is among the better somewhat type-safe template languages in the wild, with reasonably good IDE support. C# was designed with FFI in mind (as compared to Java and some other languages) so JS imports and exports fit reasonably well in C#; the boundaries aren't too hairy.That said, C# by itself isn't always that big of leap from Typescript. C# has better pattern matching today, but overall the languages feel like step-brothers and in general the overhead of shipping an entire .NET CLR, most of the BCL, and your C# code as web assembly is a lot more than just writing things more vanilla in Typescript. You can also push C# more functional with libraries like LanguageExt (though you also fight the reasons to pick C# by doing so as so many engineers don't think LanguageExt feels enough like C# to justify using C#).I'm curious to try Bolero [0] as F# would be a more interesting jump/reason for WASM, but I don't think I could sell it to engineering teams at my day job. (Especially as it can't use Razor syntax, because Razor is pretty deeply tied to C# syntax, and has its own very different template languages.)With WASM not having easy direct access to the DOM, Blazor's renderer is basically what you would expect it to be: it tosses simple objects over to a tiny Virtual DOM renderer on the JS side. It has most of the advantages and disadvantages of just using something like React or Preact directly, but obviously a smaller body of existing performance optimizations. Blazor's Virtual DOM has relatively great performance given the WASM to JS and back data management and overhead concerns, but it's still not going to out-compete hand written Vanilla JS any time soon.[0] https://fsbolero.io/",

          "content": "I second this; the tooling is somehow still not there after 10 years.- The main toolchain for compiling existing C codebases to WebAssembly is Emscripten. It still hasn't escaped its tech-demo origins, and it's a rats' nest of compiler flags and janky polyfills. There are at least 3 half-finished implementations of everything. It doesn't follow semver, so every point release tends to have some breaking changes.- The \"modern\" toolchain, wasi-sdk, is much more barebones. It's getting to the point of being usable, but I can't use it myself because it ships a precompiled libc and libc++ that use `-O3`, whereas Emscripten recompiles and caches the sysroot and uses `-Oz` if I tell it to. This increases the code size, which is already quite large.- LLVM is still not very good at emitting optimized WebAssembly bytecode.- Engines are still not very good at compiling WebAssembly bytecode to optimized machine code.- Debug info, as you mentioned, is a total mess.- Rust's WebAssembly tooling is on life support. The rustwasm GitHub organization was \"sunset\" in mid-2025 after years of inactivity.- There is still no official way to import WebAssembly modules from JavaScript in a cross-platform manner, in the year of our lord 2026. If you're deploying to the browser and using Vite or raw ES modules, you can use `WebAssembly.instantiateStreaming(fetch(new URL('./foo.wasm', import.meta.url)))` and eat the top-level await. Vite recognizes the `new URL('...', import.meta.url)` pattern and will include the asset in the build output, but most other bundlers (e.g. Rollup and esbuild) do not. If you're on Node, you can't do this, because `fetch` does not work for local files. Most people just give up and embed the WebAssembly binary as a huge Base64 string, which increases the filesize by 33% and greatly reduces the compression ratio.- If you want multithreaded WebAssembly, you need to set the COOP/COEP headers in order to gain access to `SharedArrayBuffer`. GitHub Pages still doesn't let you do this, although it's the third-most-upvoted feature request. There's a janky workaround that installs a service worker. All bets are off on how that workaround interacts with PWAs.If the tooling situation had advanced past \"tech demo\" in the past 8 years since WebAssembly first shipped, a lot more people would be using it.",

If you use something like Go or .NET, sure, then there’s a heavier runtime, maybe a megabyte, maybe two, also depends on whether Unicode/CLDR tables are needed, and then JS will probably win handily on bundle size and startup time.• JavaScript can’t execute while it’s downloading. In theory speculative parsing and even limited speculative execution is possible, but I don’t think any engine has tried that seriously.

Complexity inevitably grows over time, so spending that complexity budget carefully is crucial, especially since a specification is only useful if it remains implementable by a broad set of engines.WebAssembly MVP is a good example: it offered limited initial value but was exceptionally simple. Overall, I am happy with how the spec evolved with the exceptions of 128-bit simd and relaxed-simd.The main issue I see with 128-bit simd is that it was always clear it would not be the final vector extension. Modern hardware already widely supports 256-bit vector widths, with 512-bit becoming more common. Thus, 128-bit simd increasingly delivers only a fraction of native performance rather than the often-cited \"near-native\" performance. A flexible-vectors design (similar to ARM SVE or the RISC-V vector extension) could have provided a single, future-proof SIMD model and preserved \"near-native\" performance for much longer.From a long-term perspective, this feels like a trade-off of short-term value for a large portion of the spec's complexity budget. Though, I may be underestimating the real challenges for JIT implementers, and I am likely biased being the author of a Wasm interpreter where flexible-vectors would be far more beneficial than 128-bit simd.Why you think flexible-vectors might never have a realistic path to standardization?",

Problems WASM/WASI doesn't solve:- Building / moving file hierarchies around- Compatibility with software that expects Linux APIs like /proc- Port binding, DNS, service naming- CLI / API tooling for service managementAnd about a gazillion other things. WASI, meanwhile, is just a very small subset of POSIX but with a bunch of stuff renamed so nothing works on it. It's not meaningfully portable in any way outside of UNIX so you might as well just write a real Linux app. WASI buys you nothing.WASM is heavily overfit to the browser user case. I think a lot of the dissipated excitement is due to people not appreciating how much that is true. The JVM is a much more general technology than WASM is which is why it was able to move between such different use cases successfully (starting on smart TV boxes, then applets, then desktop apps, then servers + smart cards, then Android), whereas WASM never made it outside the browser in any meaningful way.WASM seems to exist mostly because Mozilla threw up over the original NaCL proposal (which IMO was quite elegant). They said it wasn't 'webby', a quality they never managed to define IMO. Before WASM Google also had a less well known proposal to formally extend the web with JVM bytecode as a first class citizen, which would have allowed fast DOM/JS bindings (Java has an official DOM/JS bindings API for a long time due to the applet heritage). The bytecode wouldn't have had full access to the entire Java SE API like applets did, so the security surface area would have been much smaller and it'd have run inside the renderer sandbox like V8. But Mozilla rejected that too.So we have WASM. Ignoring the new GC extensions, it's basically just regular assembly language with masked memory access and some standardized ABI stuff, with the major downside that no CPU vendor uses it so it has to be JIT compiled at great expense. A strange animal, not truly excellent at anything except pleasing the technical aesthetic tastes of the Mozillians.

So they block it entirely.This is the reason why they aren't blacking out IPv4From my own experience, my ex gf was iranian. She was using discord via some psiphon vpn or something iirc idk how she got access to it but she had it.I didn't trust psiphon that much so I asked her to install proton vpn and it did work. I wanted to play minecraft with her so prismlauncher but resources couldn't be downloaded so I made her download protonvpn so that she can play minecraft with me/install it (piracy was forced and also at that point necessary)She was using tlauncher which somehow worked but tlauncher was russian spyware and prism launcher was open sourceI talked to her about how she could use stablecoins crypto but crypto was illegal so ended up not suggesting it in the end to prevent inflation or talked to her about gold which is wild considering its like 3-4 months after we broke up but inflation is at 50% now.Anyways the point being that protonvpn worked and other vpn worked too.My question is, would things like protonvpn work after this blackout? I mean marco's and other comments in a thread explain to me that ipv4 can be blocked by them so I presume vpn's for ipv4 would shut down. And so vpns would most likely be using ipv6 which got blocked downSo does that mean that now Iranian people can't access vpns?I also saw the other day some video about how when people called Iranian numbers from outside countries some random AI  robot ass voice called and asked who are you and who are you talking to? And gave pause, and the most logical explaination to it was that the govt was recording these things so dont say anything to them. It was a creepypasta video.Briar might help but Briar still leaks some metadata when I talked to their authors or heard about it online.Instagram isn't blocked in Iran so are these social media apps still there after the blackout?This raises so many questions and wtf is happening in the world",

Iran's internet is diverse at the edge, and bottlenecked at the international gateway.Censorship, throttling, and (presumably) surveillance occurs at both layers. In some cases, also the region matters (Sistan and Baluchistan for example have experienced extended blackouts). In part that heterogeneity is because they still ideally want to keep businesses or VIPs online to mitigate the economic loss or logistical issues.Consequently, the actual means of blocking tends to be on an ISP basis: some will simply drop packets, some will have left certain endpoints open, some will leave international DNS open, etc etc. All that changes when activists notice, exploit the opening, and then the ISP finds out. And then sometimes the TIC (the gateway) will impose blanket limitations or throttling.My impression is that Iranian intelligence cares less about means than effectiveness, and ISP operators want to keep their license, livelihoods and lives, so they figure out how to meet the mandate. Given that this is something like the fourth blackout in recent years, they've gotten enough practice that there's few options out (that aren't Starlink).",

          "content": "This is a healthy thing to happen to the Linux browser ecosystem imho.We talk a lot about browser diversity, but on Linux and Windows, it is a lie. You have firefox (gecko) and fifty flavors of chromium. Webkit on Linux has essentially been relegated to embedded devices or the GNOME epiphany browser, which I'll admit while is a noble effort, lags a bit in the stability and power-user features department. Big reason for that is that it lacks the commercial backing to keep up with the modern web standards rat race.Kagi bringing orion to Linux changes the calculus. It introduces a third commercially incentivized, consumer-grade engine to the platform. Even if you never use orion, you want this to succeed because it forces WebKitGTK upstream to get better, which benefits the entire open source ecosystem.The sticking point like always will be media playback (read: DRM/widevine). That is the graveyard where Linux browsers go to die. If Kagi can legally and technically solve the widevine integration on a non-standard Linux webkit build, they win. If not, it will be a secondary browser.",

We've had them on macOS in various forms over the years (with OmniWeb being the original), but for a long time the only browsers built to integrate well with Linux desktops were minimal and light on features (like the WebKit version of GNOME Web/Epiphany).It probably matters less to Linux users who do the minimal tiling WM thing, but as someone more drawn to traditional floating DEs it's always bothered me how alien the browsers one might actually want to use feel running in a GTK or Qt DE. Themes can help reduce the gap, but it never disappears — that last 10-20% always remains as an unavoidable side effect of how the big browsers are built, with it being particularly pronounced with Firefox and derivatives.Of course a GTK based browser like Orion isn't going to feel the best under a Qt desktop like KDE, but GTK themed to match Plasma is a good deal closer than the bespoke UI found in e.g. Firefox or Chrome.",

Providing a tarball under an open source license doesn't add any significant work.\n2. No one has asked for the Kagi backends to be open sourced, so why is the browser different? Obviously because I run the browser on my machine. Your backend runs on your machine.\n3. We need to protect our IP. Then release it under a copyleft license. Or if you absolutely must, release your proprietary bit under a non-open source license.\n4. You don't need the source because we send 0 telemetry, which you can verify using a network proxy.

Currently, Safari only offers Google, Bing, Yahoo, DuckDuckGo, and Ecosia, preventing users from choosing legitimate alternatives like Kagi.While workarounds exist, they’re cumbersome and don’t provide a seamless experience. Please consider allowing users to add custom search engines as default options, similar to macOS Safari.

Orion isn't open source yet primarily because we're a 5-person team that spent 6+ years building this and created significant IP doing so, and we're not in a position to defend our work against a well-funded company using it as a base (we care very much about the business model of the browser surviving). Restrictive licenses help in theory but enforcing them against a company with a larger legal budget doesn't.We also see limited upside from community contributions - the number of people who can meaningfully work on a WebKit browser is small (from our experience hiring), and most of them already work at Apple or Kagi. Meanwhile, managing an open source codebase of this size would add real strain to our small team.The plan is however to open source when Orion is self-sufficient (business model of Orion is you are the customer and can pay for it - like we used to pay for browsers 20 years ago before advertisers started paying for our browsing), meaning it can sustain its own development independent of Kagi Search. I want to take the opportunity to thank all people who supported the Orion browser vision  [1]. We're not there yet but recent 1.0 launch and expanding to Linux are steps in that direction. And on Jan 1st this year we began development of Orion for Windows (HN exclusive yay!).I understand this is unsatisfying to people who want source access now. It's a tradeoff we've made deliberately, not something we're hiding behind.[1] https://kagi.com/stats?sub_stats=orion",

The issue is also the distinction between widevine L1, i.e hardware-backed DRM and L3 (the software backed one).Correct me if I'm wrong but to stream 4K, studios require a hardware root of trust and a verified media path. They need a guarantee that the video frames are decrypted inside a trusted execution environment  and sent directly to the display without the OS kernel or user space being able to read the raw buffer.AFAIK Windows and macOS provide this pipeline at the OS level. OTOH, ChromeOS gets 1080p/4K not because it has massive market share but cause the hardware and boot chain are locked down by the almighty Google.On desktop Linux, where you have root access and can modify the kernel or compositor to inspect memory, there is technically no way to guarantee that secure path to the studios' satisfaction. Am I right in this assumption?Unless the DRM providers change their threat model, which sounds unlikely to me. Or distros start shipping signed and locked-down kernel modules that prevent the user from being root, which is again unacceptable to most (me included), we will likely be capped at 720p for some time now.",

Adenosine build-up leads to increased sleep pressure, and improved Neural Function of Sleep, not just \"being unconscious\".This is where things get a bit interesting when we look at depression. For many people, depression results in decreased Neural Function of Sleep (specifically slow-wave activity) even though sleep time often increases.However there is also some evidence that restricting slow-wave activity can act as a \"reset\" button. The researchers I have spoken to about this are either in the \"too dangerous to do the research\" camp, or \"distrupting slow-waves for a very short period, then increase slow-wave activity\".Of course, sleep and exercise would only be a single pathway to improving depression outcomes. Exercise alone, and the dopamine, oxygenation, and many other outcomes are also likely to come into play.Comparing this to pharmaceutical or behavioural therapies, I can see why they'd be as effective. You're treating the entire system, not just trying to change a single chemical in the brain, specifically when we aren't even measuring the chemical before or after treatment.",

Unfortunately, anti-depressants are under or just barely reach this threshold [3-4], and so should be widely to be considered ineffective or only borderline effective, on average. Of course this is complicated by the fact that some people get worse on these treatments, and some people experience dramatic improvements, but, still, the point is, depression is extremely hard to treat.Unfortunately, this also means that if exercise is only nearly as effective as therapy for depression, it may mean that the benefits of exercise are not actually really clinically observable, if measured properly and not just based on arbitrary statistical significance.EDIT: There is less data on MCIDs for therapy, but at least one review suggests therapy effects can be in the 10+ point range [5].

Others are stuck in cognitive distortions and merely learning about them and handling them (through cognitive behavioral therapy) can be life changing.But if you have major trauma in your past, exercise is probably not going to do much. If you are heavily overwhelmed and your body is stuck in perpetual flight or fight) exercise and meditation might be a giant help.But right now the practitioners are aware of this, but it's really hard to double blind test these divisions until people can do the analysis first.

As a child, growing up in a broken home situation and bad school environment, of course there is going to be depression. Life sucks.

Only breaking out of that situation will.As an adult, I’ve absolutely had and broken out of a long episode of depression with exercise. Bad breakup, startup failure, then introduce chronic drinking and subsequent weight gain. Guess what, cutting back on drinking, bicycling to work 30 minutes each way, doing martial arts in the evenings, it was a great fix. It enhanced self image, added a new community of positive people, and broke a cycle of depression.",

It might have been the only time I managed to get out of bed all week, but, I mean, how can I possibly skip Parkrun?I never actually linked the exercise to the boost in my mental health until I had it pointed out to me at that moment. I go for a run and I feel better because of the run. I would spend the whole 5km stewing and ruminating and maybe in tears but half hour after getting home I could function! it’s stuck with me ever since, and I’ve never (yet) been so down again.Tomorrow will be my 429th Parkrun :)[0] https://www.parkrun.com/",

Google has deep pockets and could easily just say \"f-it, we're betting on AI coding and this tool helps us make UIs and $2M/year is nothing compared to what we're spending on AI.\" It's also possible that the AI Studio team has a small discretionary budget and is giving Tailwind $6,000/year.It's good, but it's important to read this as \"they're offering some money\" and not \"Tailwind CSS now doesn't have financial issues because they have a major sponsor.\" This could just be a 1-5% change in Tailwind's budget.

He created the basis of Tailwind just to help him build these projects, but it kept getting attention when he would post about his progress building them online.Here's an important quote from the doc:\"Now at this point I had zero intention of maintaining any sort of open-source CSS framework. It didn’t even occur to me that what I had been building would even be interesting to anyone. But stream after stream, people were always asking about the CSS\"It seems like Adam's main goal was to start a software business, and Tailwind just happened to get popular and became what he pivoted his efforts into.  There's obviously nothing wrong with wanting to start a business, but trying to take an open-source CSS framework and turn it into a multi-million dollar business feels unnatural and very difficult to maintain long-term.To his credit, he did pull it off.  He built a seemingly quite successful business and hired a sizable team, and apparently made a decent amount of revenue along the way.But now, for AI reasons or otherwise, that business is struggling and failing to sustain the scale it was before.  To me, it seems like the business is more or less completely separate from the open-source Tailwind project itself.  It's, as far as I can understand, a business that sells templates and components built with Tailwind, and it uses Tailwind's popularity to bootstrap customers and sales.If it were me who ended up building Tailwind, there's no way I would have pursued turning it into a big business.  Maybe I would have tried some kind of consulting style, where I'd offer my time to companies evaluating or integrating Tailwind.Now that Tailwind is getting hundreds of thousands (millions?) of dollars a year in sponsorships, it feels weird to have this for-profit business on the side at the same time.Maybe it's just my own sensibilities and worldview, but I feel like Tailwind should just be what it is: an extremely popular and successful open-source CSS framework.[1] https://adamwathan.me/tailwindcss-from-side-project-byproduc...",

Ex: Plan mode is basically bootstrapping how that TODO list gets seeded and how todos ground themselves when they get reached, and user interactions are how you realign the todo lists. The todolist is subtle but was a big shift in coding tools, and many seem to be surprised when we discuss it -- most seem to focus on whether to use plan mode or not, but todo lists will still be active. I ran a fun experiment last month on how well claude code solves CTFs, and disabling the TodoList tool and planning is 1-2 grade jumps: https://media.ccc.de/v/39c3-breaking-bots-cheating-at-blue-t... .Fwiw, I found it funny how the article stuffs \"smarter context management\" into a breeze-y TODO bullet point at the end for going production-grade. I've been noticing a lot of NIH/DIY types believing they can do a good job of this and then, when forced to have results/evals that don't suck in production, losing the rest of the year on that step.

Two goals: understand real-world agent mechanics and validate patterns I'd observed across OpenAI Codex and contemporary agents.The core loop is straightforward: LLM + system prompt + tool calls. The differentiator is the harness, CLI, IDE extension, sandbox policies, filesystem ops (grep/sed/find). But what separates effective agents from the rest is context engineering. Anthropic and Manus has published various research articles around this topic.After building vtcode, my takeaway: agent quality reduces to two factors, context management strategy and model capability.

I built a persistent Python REPL subprocess as an MCP tool for CC, it worked so insanely well that I decided to go all the way. I already had an agentic framework built around tool calling (agentlib), so I adapted it for this new paradigm and code agent was born.The agent \"boots up\" inside the REPL. Here's the beginning of the system prompt:  >>> help(assistant)\n\n  You are an interactive coding assistant operating within a Python REPL.\n  Your responses ARE Python code—no markdown blocks, no prose preamble.\n  The code you write is executed directly.\n\n  >>> how_this_works()\n\n  1. You write Python code as your response\n  2. The code executes in a persistent REPL environment\n  3. Output is shown back to you IN YOUR NEXT TURN\n  4. Call `respond(text)` ...\n\nYou get the idea. No need for custom file editing tools--Python has all that built in and Claude knows it perfectly. No JSON marshaling or schema overhead. Tools are just Python functions injected into the REPL, zero context bloat.I also built a browser control plugin that puts Claude directly into the heart of a live browser session. It can inject element pickers so I can click around and show it what I'm talking about. It can render prototype code before committing to disk, killing the annoying build-fix loop. I can even SSH in from my phone and use TTS instead of typing, surprisingly great for frontend design work. Knocked out a website for my father-in-law's law firm (gresksingleton.com) in a few hours that would've taken 10X that a couple years ago, and it was super fun.The big win: complexity. CC has been a disaster on my bookkeeping system, there's a threshold past which Claude loses the forest for the trees and makes the same mistakes over and over. Code agent pushes that bar out significantly. Claude can build new tools on the fly when it needs them. Gemini works great too (larger context).Have fun out there! /end-rant",

That was (as far as I know) the first of these articles making the point that the core of a coding agent is actually quite simple (and all the deep complexity is in the LLM). Reading it was a light-bulb moment for me.FWIW, I agree with other commenters here that you do need quite a bit of additional scaffolding (like TODOs and much more) to make modern agents work well. And Claude Code itself is a fairly complex piece of software with a lot of settings, hooks, plugins, UI features, etc. Although I would add that once you have a minimal coding agent loop in place, you can get it to bootstrap its own code and add those things! That is a fun and slightly weird thing to try.(By the way, the \"January 2025\" date on this article is clearly a typo for 2026, as Claude Code didn't exist a year ago and it includes use of the claude-sonnet-4-20250514 model from May.)Edit: and if you're interested in diving deeper into what Claude Code itself is doing under the hood, a good tool to understand it is \"claude-trace\" (https://github.com/badlogic/lemmy/tree/main/apps/claude-trac...). You can use it to see the whole dance with tool calls and the LLM: every call out to the LLM and the LLM's responses, the LLM's tool call invocations and the responses from the agent to the LLM when tools run, etc. When Claude Skills came out I used this to confirm my guess about how they worked (they're a tool call with all the short skill descriptions stuffed into the tool description base prompt). Reading the base prompt is also interesting. (Among other things, they explicitly tell it not to use emoji, which tracks as when I wrote my own agent it was indeed very emoji-prone.)",

Then I both braindump and / or ask it to do market research on each item and the parameters I want to be considered, and then to update the task accordingly. I then review them all. Then I can go \"work on these in parallel\" and it spins up as many agents as there are tasks, and goes to work. I don't always make it do the work in parallel if its a lot of tasks because Zed has frozen up on me, I read that Claude Code is fine its just the protocol that Zed uses that gets hosed up.I find that with Beads, because I refine the tickets with Claude, it does way better at tasks this way.

Having said that, it's not clear how much that really matters at all for making the Claude Code CLI specifically better-performing than other coding agents using the same LLM (the tool calls are fairly generic and the LLMs are good at plenty of tool calls they weren't RLVRed on too).The other advantage Anthropic have is just that they can sell CC subscriptions at lower cost because they own the models. But that's a separate set of questions that don't really relate to technical capabilities.Anyhow, to follow up on your point, I do find it surprising that Claude Code is still (it seems?) definitively leading the pack in terms of coding agents. I've tried Gemini CLI and Codex and they feel distinctly less good, but I'm surprised we haven't seen too many alternatives from small startups or open source projects rise to the top as well.

So much of the current ecosystem is suboptimal just because it's new. The models are trained around immutable conversation ledgers with user/tool/assistant blocks, but there are compelling reasons to manipulate both sides at runtime and add synthetic exchanges. Priming with a synthetic failure and recovery is often more effective than a larger, more explicit system message. Same with memory, we just haven't figured out what works best.For code agents specifically, I found myself wanting old style completion models without the structured turn training--doesn't exist for frontier models. Talking to Claude about its understanding of the input token stream was fascinating; it compared it to my visual cortex and said it'd be unreasonable to ask me to comment on raw optic nerve data.\"Tell it to reread it again\"-exactly the problem. My bookkeeping/decision engine has so much documentation I'm running out of context, and every bit is necessary due to interconnected dependencies. Telling it to reread content already in the window feels wrong, that's when I refine the docs or adjust the framework. I've also found myself adding way more docstrings and inline docs than I'd ever write for myself. I prefer minimal, self-documenting code, so it's a learning process.There's definitely an art to prompts, and it varies wildly by model, completely different edge cases across the leading ones.

Thanks again for writing that first Emperor Has No Clothes blog post; like I said, it really inspired me and made everything click early on when I was first dipping my toes into the world of agents. Whenever I teach this stuff to other engineers, I often think back to that moment of realizing exactly how the exchange between LLM, tool call requests, tool functions, and agent code works and I try to get that across as the central takeaway. These days I usually add diagrams to get really clear on what happens on which side of the model api.I do wonder whether the path here was:1) You wrote the article in April 20252) The next generation of LLMs trained on your article3) The author of TFA had a similar idea, and heavily used LLMs to help write the code and the article, including asking the LLM to think of a catchy title. And guess what title the LLM comes up with?There are also less charitable interpretations, of course. But I'd rather assume this was honestly, if sloppily, done.",

For many, the idea of being able to see England, Belgium, Germany, Austria, Yugoslavia, Bulgaria, Turkey, Iran, Afghanistan, Pakistan and India in one 50 day trip with many similar minded travelers who aren't in a rush is really quite appealing.Also, with bus travel you could, if you felt like it, leave the trip to enjoy many more local attractions and resume your travels later in a way not afforded by airplane or rail travel.",

On a plane everyone is going from A->B, people on the train could be starting/ending anywhere along the route, including small towns you've never heard of.Cons:- 32 hours of travel- Pay an extra ~$500 to get a bed, or sleep in your seatOverall I have no regrets but I'll probably not do this again until I'm retired or extremely bored.",

Also, a ticket is only $30-50, so about a tank of gas. This is likely why it’s Amtrak’s busiest and most profitable route outside the NEC.

This is a mechanism that has largely been deprecated by the modern attention economy.In the era of hitchhiking, the bandwidth for novelty was low. A driver on a long commute had no podcasts, no Spotify or audiobooks. A stranger with a story was high value. The transaction was something like = I provide logistics and you provide content; like the story of your cross-country bike trip.Today, we have near infinite content in our pockets. The marginal utility of a stranger's story has plummeted because the competition is Joe Rogan or an endless algorithmic feed. We have largely replaced the P2P protocol of kindness with a sort of centralized platform of service. We stripped out the human latency and the requirement for social reciprocity and replaced it with currency and star ratings. It makes me surreal to think about this.",

          "content": "I see others expressing this point, but I'll add my two cents: this essay really bothered me.1. The writer describes hitchhiking to work every day, presumably for months or years. He doesn't describe in any way how he paid back that kindness, either to the people he rode with directly, or just by paying it forward.2. The writer describes traveling in Asia for 8 years, and many of the instances of kindness he describe imply very strongly that he intentionally put himself at risk, where others were faced with the choice to help him or let him suffer consequences. It's one thing to get caught in a rip current and need assistance; it's another entirely to swim out past where you are safe, and then wait for someone to rescue you -- and to do that repeatedly for eight years. Further, it is obvious from the language used that he was traveling rough by choice, with the privilege and economic security of his background, and yet repeatedly accepting -- I would argue demanding -- the help of people from a poorer background than himself. He was cosplaying poverty and repeatedly being assisted by people living it for real.3. The backyard idea seems similarly pushy. He says he was never turned away, not once. So he believes that no one, given an actual free choice, would rather not have a stranger camp in their backyard. He ignores the possibility that people would feel uncomfortable about rejecting someone presenting as having no place to stay, and rather believes that everyone he asked woke up that day thinking about how happy they'd be to do a favor for a stranger. And he couches the whole process as him doing them a favor.4. He lists multiple instances where people less well-off than him went to great lengths to help him, without ever thinking about why they might feel obligated, and through it all admitting that not only doesn't he engage in such kindness himself, he can't imagine that he would.5. And through it all he characterizes what he very nearly describes as him pushing himself on people as \"willingness to be helped\" -- as some sort of saintliness.And of course each of these people only saw him once, for a short while. Reading this essay we see how it is a pattern: how he is essentially a traveling con man, moving from mark to mark, letting each of them believe that he just happens to need help this one time, so they put good out into the universe. But in reality he is taking, taking, taking, abusing the world's willingness to help -- if everyone did what he did, the world would swiftly become a meaner, poorer place.",

He'd been my (very distant) boss at Wired, was a published author of one of my favorite books, a very well-known figure and a smiling but disarmingly calm manner. He sat and amicably talked for hours with a yard full of people, many of whom have become some of my closet friends. Then, as the evening closed, he asked if he could sleep in my yard too. Others had brought tents, and burning men structures, and it had begun to rain. Kevin pulled out a camping sleeping bag from nowhere, struck out, and I saw him later, in the soaking, muddy garden, quietly curled up under someone's geodesic dome structure.Decades later, after Covid, I mailed him out of the blue, and asked him for advice. He immediately remembered me, invited me to his home, and talked to me, again, for an hour or so, about AI, optimism, and how to change the world.To be frank, I never emailed him thank you, and I still feel guilty about that, but now I feel like it was never needed or asked for.

As we go through the daily grind of life, we forget how privileged we are to be alive.I found the following two paragraphs truly incredible.> All of us begin in the same place. Whether sinner or saint, we are not owed our life. Our existence is an unnecessary extravagance, a wild gesture, an unearned gift. Not just at birth. The eternal surprise is being funneled to us daily, hourly, minute by minute, every second. As you read these words, you are rinsed with the gift of time. Yet, we are terrible recipients. We are no good at being helpless, humble, or indebted. Being needy is not celebrated on day-time TV shows, or in self-help books. We make lousy kindees.> I’ve slowly changed my mind about spiritual faith. I once thought it was chiefly about believing in an unseen reality; that it had a lot in common with hope. But after many years of examining the lives of the people whose spiritual character I most respect, I’ve come to see that their faith rests on gratitude, rather than hope. The beings I admire exude a sense of knowing they are indebted, of resting upon a state thankfulness. They recognize they are at the receiving end of an ongoing lucky ticket called being alive. When the truly faithful worry, it’s not about doubt (which they have); it’s about how they might not maximize the tremendous gift given them. How they might be ungrateful by squandering their ride. The faithful I admire are not certain about much except this: that this state of being embodied, inflated with life, brimming with possibilities, is so over-the-top unlikely, so extravagant, so unconditional, so far out beyond physical entropy, that is it indistinguishable from love. And most amazing of all, like my hitchhiking rides, this love gift is an extravagant gesture you can count on. This is the meta-miracle: that the miracle of gifts is so dependable.

The discomfort so many people in this thread feel with receiving kindness and the devaluing of the gift of companionship, gratitude, and a good story is a testament to how far off human norms our society is these days.I struggle with this a lot myself - I've had to overcome deep feelings of inadequacy and insecurity because I never valued what I offered people just by being present and because I always felt like I had to \"square the books\" - that every interaction or relationship was an exchange that needed to square its ledgers. The best thing for my mental health has been to become comfortable just being with people and accepting their continued presence and return to my company as something that doesn't require an exchange - that human companionship and kindness are things we enjoy as people, not services to be itemized and accounted for.One interesting note on this is that it's not just an \"old world\" phenomenon - if you look at many old farmhouses across the midwest, they've got a separate covered section that's accessible from outside the house - the assumption was that travelers passing by could and would spend the night there, and often the owners would have supplies of oatcakes or other durable foodstuffs for travelers, because everyone who traveled needed somewhere to stay or something to eat at some point, and reciprocity could be assumed when the homeowner traveled themselves in the future.",

I switched the store I use three, four months ago, but I can already talk about some of the employees at the store I visit. Louis is back where he grew up right now because his 97-year-old grandfather died. Among other things, he feels lucky grandpa's passing came after the new year because of his time-off allotment. Nikki had great holidays, mostly because her adult daughter was here for a week. Nadine (\"Shh.\") has decided she's going to retire at the end of the month but hasn't yet told anyone at the store.Raffy, the UPS delivery guy I see maybe five times a year? He's doing well, finally feeling things slowing down some after the holidays. His fiancé will finish her graduate degree this spring, then they're going to decide if they want to stay here or move back to the state where they were born. They like it here, but think job opportunities will be better back home.I'm sure many here are familiar with \"This is Water,\" the commencement speech given by David Foster Wallace. Many often cite his line, \"Everybody worships,\" his observation that we all hold aspects of life in reverence, whether religious things or otherwise. It's a valid, pithy point, but I always thought the key part to his speech comes later and has been widely overlooked:And the so-called real world will not discourage you from operating on your default settings, because the so-called real world of men and money and power hums merrily along in a pool of fear and anger and frustration and craving and worship of self. Our own present culture has harnessed these forces in ways that have yielded extraordinary wealth and comfort and personal freedom. The freedom all to be lords of our tiny skull-sized kingdoms, alone at the centre of all creation. This kind of freedom has much to recommend it. But of course there are all different kinds of freedom, and the kind that is most precious you will not hear much talk about much in the great outside world of wanting and achieving.... The really important kind of freedom involves attention and awareness and discipline, and being able truly to care about other people and to sacrifice for them over and over in myriad petty, unsexy ways every day.He delivered that speech in 2005. Before the modern smartphone. All those people I mentioned earlier were strangers. That's no longer the case because all of us chose to interrupt what we were doing and open up a little to someone unfamiliar. It's a choice.

Within seconds, a crowd of men gathered, some from the bus stop nearby, others from the restaurant in front of the parking spot. \"Get back in and reverse when we tell you\", said one person. Then a group of about 5 men literally lifted the front of my car and placed the wheels back on terra firma. I reversed out of the ditch, parked the car and got out to thank them, but they had dispersed as rapidly as they had assembled. I always thought my people a bit brusque in social interactions -- we don't greet shopkeepers or supermarket cashiers; we don't smile randomly at each other; we don't often say thank you.

          "content": "Hey! I created Jeff Dean Facts! Not the jokes themselves, but the site that collected them.It was in 2008 I think (give or take a year, can't remember). I worked at Google at the time. Chunk Norris Facts was a popular Internet meme (which I think later faded when he came out as MAGA, but I digress...). A colleague (who wishes to remain anonymous) thought the idea of Jeff Dean Facts would be funny, and April 1st was coming up.At the time, there was a team working on an experimental web app hosting platform code named Prometheus -- it was later released as App Engine. Using an early, internal build I put together a web site where people could submit \"facts\" about Jeff Dean, rate each other's facts on a five-star scale, and see the top-rated facts. Everything was anonymous. I had a few coworkers who are funnier than me populate some initial facts.I found a few bugs in Prometheus in the process, which the team rapidly fixed to meet my \"launch date\" of April 1st. :)On the day, which I think was a Sunday, early in the morning, I sent an email to the company-wide \"misc\" mailing list (or maybe it was eng-misc?) from a fake email address (a google group alias with private membership), and got the mailing list moderator to approve it.It only took Jeff an hour or two to hack his way through the back-end servers (using various internal-facing status pages, Borg logs, etc.) to figure out my identity.But everyone enjoyed it!My only regret is that I targeted the site specifically at Jeff and not Sanjay Ghemawat. Back then, Jeff & Sanjay did everything together, and were responsible for inventing a huge number of core technologies at Google (I have no idea to what extent they still work together today). The site was a joke, but I think it had the side effect of elevating Jeff above Sanjay, which is not what I intended. Really the only reason I targeted Jeff is because he's a bit easier to make fun of personality-wise, and because \"Jeff Dean Facts\" sort of rolls off the tongue easier that \"Sanjay Ghemawat Facts\" -- but in retrospect this feels a little racist. :(My personal favorite joke is: Jeff Dean puts his pants on one leg at a time, but if he had more than two legs, you'd see his approach is actually O(log n).",

It's not clear whether this fact is really true, or whether this line is simply part of the joke, so I've omitted the usual (TRUE) identifier here. Interpret this as you see fit :)I think this one's true-ish. Back in the day when Google didn't have good cron services for the corp and production domains [1], Jeff Dean's workstation ran a job that made something called (iirc) the \"protocol buffer debug database\". Basically, a big file (probably an sstable) with compiled .proto introspection data for a huge number of checked-in protobufs. You could use it to produce human-readable debug output from what was otherwise a fairly indecipherable blob. I don't think it was ever intended for production use, but some things that shouldn't have ended up using it. I think after Jeff had been on vacation for a while, his `prodaccess` credentials expired, the job stopped working, maybe the output became unavailable, and some things broke.Here's a related story I know is true: when I was running Google Reader, I got paged frequently for Bigtable replication delay, and I eventually traced it to trouble accessing files that shared GFS chunkservers with this database. I mentioned it on some mailing list, and almost immediately afterward Jeff Dean CCed me on a code review changing the file's replication from r=3 to r=12.

I remember when Jeff and Sanjay wrote \"gsearch\", a distributed grep over google3 that ran on 40-80 machines [1].There was a series of talks called \"Nooglers and the PDB\" I think, and I remember Jeff explained gsearch to maybe 20-40 of us in a small conference room in building 43.It was a tiny and elegant piece of code -- something like ~2000 total lines of C++, with \"indexer\" (I think it just catted all the files, which were later mapped into memory), replicated server, client, and Borg config.The auth for the indexer lived in Jeff's home dir, perhaps similar to the protobuf DB.That was some of the first \"real Google C++ distributed system\" code I read, and it was eye opening.---After that talk, I submitted a small CL to that directory (which I think Sanjay balked at slightly, but Jeff accepted).  And then I put a Perforce watch on it to see what other changes were being submitted.I think the code was dormant for awhile, but later I saw someone named Russ Cox started submitting a ton of changes to it.  That became the public Google Code Search product [2].  My memory is that Russ wrote something like 30K lines of google3 C++ in a single summer, and then went on to write RE2 (which I later used in Bigtable, etc.)Much of that work is described here: https://swtch.com/~rsc/regexp/I remember someone telling him on a mailing list something like \"you can't just write your own regex engine; there are too many corner cases in PCRE\"And many people know that Russ Cox went on to be one of the main contributors to the Go language.  After the Code Search internship, he worked on Go, which was open sourced in 2009.---[1] Actually I wonder if today if this could perform well enough a single machine with 64 or 128 cores.  Back then I think the prod machines were something like 2, 4, or 8 cores.[2] This was the trigram regex search over open source code on the web.

          "content": "A bit more detail: long ago, before the time of the Great Brace War, people wrote code using all sorts of styles: tabs/spaces, short or long variable/function names, Hungarian notation or not, comments or not, long blocks or short, and so on. You could often tell which of your teammates wrote a block of code simply by newline usage. This made it hard to read and contribute code in a less familiar part of the codebase.Google mitigated this problem at scale by introducing the concept of \"readability\" for each language (C++, Java, and Python, simpler times). If you had readability, you could approve another person's change for that language. If you didn't, you could still review the code, but the reviewee also had to go find someone else with readability.After you'd accumulated a certain number of commits in a language, you could try to get your own readability by bundling up your CLs (changelists) and submitting them to the readability queue, where a certain group of senior people with readability would evaluate whether your code was sufficiently idiomatic. This process could take months, or even years if you didn't write much in a particular language. In any event, it felt like a real achievement to get readability.The upshot of all this was that most code at Google felt authorless in a good way: if you knew and expected Google style, all the codebase felt the same, and you could concentrate on the logic flow rather than the regional dialect. And needless to say all the energy wasted on whose style was best was squelched in the readability queue.This is all past tense because I last wrote code for Google more than 10 years ago, and I'm sure the process has changed since then. Code formatters, shared editor defaults, and presubmit checks have surely automated away a lot of the toil, and there's much less of a monorepo culture these days, so there are probably more style dialects (in addition to many, many more permitted languages).",

Also they don't even show up properly in the sheet.As the melodies get longer and longer with each win, this devolves quickly into a memory game. I'd like to keep playing ear training, but I struggle with remembering what sequence of notes came at steps 8+.This is somewhat aggravated by completely resetting the current level and replaying the whole melody after a single mistake. If I keep making a mistake in note 10, I get all the notes over and over again, which is a bit maddening.",

So if you push middle C, it might look like this:NOTE_ON 60 (middle C) 98 (velocity),\nNOTE_OFF 60Some keyboards never send NOTE_OFF events, instead they send NOTE_ON with velocity 0. On these keyboards, pressing middle C looks like this:NOTE_ON 60 98,\nNOTE_ON 60 0Both are valid MIDI streams, and all stream processors should react appropriately to both.

I can play ukulele, but mostly just to strum and play songs to, but a few years ago I just started picking notes to try to recreate melodies of songs I knew or heard recently. At first it was slow-going with lots of searching on the fret for the right note, but over time I worked up the skill to mostly get the melody on the first few tries. It was the most amazing feeling to realize I could listen to a song and then reproduce it by ear.I found that it's also an excellent way to \"feel\" the structure of a melody as well since you're essentially building it up again. Of course you could read music to see the actual melody, but working it out this way feels a bit more intimate.",

I believe that's what happened here.- Once a proof is formalized into Lean (assuming you have formalized the statement correctly), there is no doubt that the proof is correct. This is the core of our approach: you can do a lot of (AI-driven) search, and once you find the answer you are certain it's correct no matter how complex the solution is.Happy to answer any questions!",

Of course, that will require a lot of human expertise too: even this one was only \"solved more or less autonomously by AI (after some feedback from an initial attempt)\".People are still going to be moving the goalposts on this and claiming it's not all that impressive or that the solution must have been in the training data or something, but at this point that's kind of dubiously close to arguing that Terence Tao doesn't know what he's talking about, which to say the least is a rather perilous position.At this point, I think I'm making a belated New Years resolution to stop arguing with people who are still staying that LLMs are stochastic parrots that just remix their training data and can never come up with anything novel. I think that discussion is now dead. There are lots of fascinating issues to work out with how we can best apply LLMs to interesting problems (or get them to write good code), but to even start solving those issues you have to at least accept that they are at least somewhat capable of doing novel things.In 2023 I would have bet hard against us getting to this point (\"there's no way chatbots can actually reason their way through novel math!\"), but here we are are three years later.

They have also been quite helpful with some routine math that I'm not as familiar with but is relatively established (like standard random matrix theory results from ~5 years ago).It does feel like the spectrum of utility is pretty aligned with what you might expect: routine programming > applied ML research > stats/applied math research > pure math research.I will say ~1 year ago they were still useless for my math research area, but things have been changing quickly.",

However, I think a weaker, but still quite valuable, type of \"artificial general cleverness\" is becoming a reality in various ways.By \"general cleverness\", I mean the ability to solve broad classes of complex problems via somewhat ad hoc means.  These means may be stochastic or the result of brute force computation; they may be ungrounded or fallible; and they may be either uninterpretable, or traceable back to similar tricks found in an AI's training data.  So they would not qualify as the result of any true \"intelligence\".  And yet, they can have a non-trivial success rate at achieving an increasingly wide spectrum of tasks, particularly when coupled with stringent verification procedures to filter out incorrect or unpromising approaches, at scales beyond what individual humans could achieve.This results in the somewhat unintuitive combination of a technology that can be very useful and impressive, while simultaneously being fundamentally unsatisfying and disappointing - somewhat akin to how one's awe at an amazingly clever magic trick can dissipate (or transform to technical respect) once one learns how the trick was performed.But perhaps this can be resolved by the realization that while cleverness and intelligence are somewhat correlated traits for humans, they are much more decoupled for AI tools (which are often optimized for cleverness), and viewing the current generation of such tools primarily as a stochastic generator of sometimes clever - and often useful - thoughts and outputs may be a more productive perspective when trying to use them to solve difficult problems.\"This comment was made on Dec. 15, so I'm not entirely confident he still holds it?https://mathstodon.xyz/@tao/115722360006034040",

We have proofs that are gigabytes (I believe even terabytes in some cases) in size, but we know they are correct because they check in Lean.This particular pattern of using state of the art work in two different areas (LLMs and theorem proving) absolutely has the potentially to fundamentally change how mathematics is done. There's a great picture on pp 381 of Type Theory and Formal Proof where you can easily see how LLMs can be placed in two of the most tricky parts of that diagram to solve.Because the work is formally verified we can throw out entire classes of LLM problems (like hallucinations).Personally I think strongly typed language, with powerful type systems are also the long term ideal coding with LLMs (but I'm less optimistic about devs following this path).",

The complex part of the problem is that from the outside, the platforms seems successful, and is growing.Therefore the complaints that are almost always prevalent are considered “edge cases.” Unfortunately, those who were part of the ecosystem, and were most passionate contributors are the ones that are leaving.Final thought for the builders of any community: pay attention to those who are not posting, instead of the new users who are signing up.

This is a large database including records from all over the world,and is made up of both modern digital observations (like those from inat), historical observations like those kept in herbariums, as well as independently published records from smaller organised research efforts.I work as in academia and do a fair amount of spacial modeling in relation to biodiversity data, and the data from iNaturalist as published in GBIF is essentially the best coverage I can find if we are talking about large geographies. I also do my own field work, tracking specific study sites and iNaturalist is a fantastic tool for generating species lists. Within about an hour, usually while also carrying out some other field task, me and my team of technicians can capture the wide majority of plant species at a given site, all with location data, time stamps, and usually high quality photos that allow me to verify the computer vision IDs. Then back in my office, I can open up iNaturlaist online, and look through all the data, as well as download it in a consistent format. I’ve also worked out methods that allow me to do something similar (albeit more focused) for bees.Seek offers essentially all the same value to researchers while also streamlining the experience for users. You are able to get a quick answer, and I still get the biodiversity data generated by you, without the clunkiness that comes from the inat app(s).Beyond scientific data, as someone who is principally a botanist, I find the accuracy of iNaturalist to be far better than things like pictureThis. So even in these cases, I still think it’s worth while for the casual user to stick with seek if you’re looking to identify mainly stationary life forms or record them for your own use.___[0] https://ebird.org/home[1] https://www.bumblebeewatch.org/[2] https://www.gbif.org/",

Endless manoeuvring for influence, currying favour, autocratic fiefdoms emerging without people having the mental framework to even identify that they exist.Humans are complicated, and we do seem to have a certain amount of low-level social wiring for hierarchy and pecking order, even if it's far from absolute.I don't know how this applies in the context of Toyota, but there are plenty of places where pushing the Stop button - while formally permitted - has a social cost such that only a certain few are effectively given permission to do so; large amounts of energy are expended either attempting to belong to that few, or currying favour with them. Power tends to accrue to those most inclined to seize it.Whereas in a more formal org, people with \"manager\" in their title are at least subject to a minimum amount of vetting, training and oversight.TLDR, flat hierarchy can be better than rigid hierarchy, but nominally \"flat\" hierarchy with power-gradient characteristics can be the worst of both worlds.",

The real insight is that differentiation and integration operations become simple if the coordinates used are exponential functions because exponential functions remain (scaled) exponential when passed through such operations.For digital signals what helps is Walsh-Hadamard basis. They are not like frequencies. They are not at all like the square wave analogue of sinusoidal waves. People call them sequency space as a well justified pun.My suspicion is that we are in Ptolemaic state as far as GPT like models are concerned. We will eventually understand them better once we figure out what's the better coordinate system to think about their dynamics in.* There is a connection though, through the exponential form of complex numbers, or more prosaically, when multiplying rotation matrices the angles combine additively.

It's necessary and useful and effective at doing what it does, but not surprisingly so. Yet in the natural sciences it often has been. This is not a statement about mathematics but about the world.(As Wittgenstein put it some decades earlier: \"So too the fact that it can be described by Newtonian mechanics asserts nothing about the world; but this asserts something, namely, that it can be described in that particular way in which as a matter of fact it is described.

I used to be a SendGrid customer until my deliverability started being affected by this issue. SendGrid took weeks to reply to my customer service messages about resolving this, even though I was a paying customer and was renting private IP addresses from them to send mail.I finally gave up and closed my SendGrid account in July 2021. Despite this, they continued to send me monthly invoices until May 2022.

However it allows situations like to happen where the FROM header, the \"From:\" address, and the return path are all different.Most mail systems have several stages of filters, and the first ones (checking authentication) are quite basic. After that, attachments, links, and contents are checked for known malware. Machine learning might kick in after this, if certain criteria are met.

It works without a heap, is a really low cost abstraction and you can do stuff concurrently on a single core chip (where you can’t just spawn a new “thread”) and you don’t have the complexity of an RTOS. I believe there is a great future for embassy ahead and it’s so great how far the team has come.I also want to give a shoutout to reqwless (https://github.com/drogue-iot/reqwless) which is a HTTP client for embassy-net that even supports HTTPS!Rust embedded was really never actually better then C or C++ but embassy for me is a big reason why I now make my buying decision based on how well I can use Rust on the MCU.",

For example:loop {\n    let btn = ir.wait_for_press().await;\n    // use btn\n}Meanwhile the compiler builds the state machine for you.I think this style is an emergent property of async + no-std that hasn’t really been collected or named yet. A lot of discussion focuses on HALs, bring-up, or executors, but less on how people structure applications once those pieces are in place.Brad Gibson and I talked about some of these ideas in this (free) article on how Embassy shines on embedded devices: https://medium.com/@carlmkadie/how-rust-embassy-shine-on-emb...I’ve also started an open repo to experiment with and document these patterns:\nhttps://github.com/carlkcarlk/device-kitWould love links to other repos that use Embassy at this higher, application-oriented level.",

Being able to compile on fast Apple M hardware and then run immediately with zero friction is awesome.It took a little bit to get my head around how to share access to peripherals etc but once I did it's been great and it's nice to know that locking semantics are essentially enforced at compile time so it's actually not possible to have 2 things stomping over the same bus etc which can sometimes be a very hard bug to track down when working with big and fast SOCs.Other really big aspect Embassy has been good for is really high quality USB and networking stacks. I am using both the USB stack (for PLDM over USB) and Ethernet w/the TCP stack in embassy_net and both have been flawless.Only real downsides I can think of are it can sometimes be hard to onboard folk that are used to copy/paste from vendor examples and sometimes communicating and debugging with vendors themselves when they aren't familar and won't engage unless you can reproduce on the vendor HAL.So overall really happy with it and I highly recommend trying it out especially if you are in the STM ecosphere.",

I found one of the biggest learning curves to be dealing with shared mutable state; embassy offers lots of primitives and tools for dealing with this that are more approachable than you'd encounter with a vanilla embedded Rust project, but there's a little bit of a time investment to learn them and you'll find yourself reading a lot of example code.Once you get the basics, though, it's very productive and I've found it surprisingly easy to write building blocks I can reuse across a wide range of hardware projects and MCUs!",

The various hardware interrupts then wake up the core and notify the executor to continue making progress.The compiler transformation from async/await to a state machine is a godsend for this.

Things like setting up the clock, setting up an I2C or SPI bus, reading and writing bytes from a UART etc. This stuff happens on every computer all the way up to a Raspberry Pi, but the bigger and more powerful the MCU the more it tends to be abstracted away by libraries and middleware.If you want to truly learn this stuff you have to get low down, strip away all the abstractions and get very familiar with the 1000+ page user manual. Doing that on the simplest microcontroller possible is a benefit, because you're not overwhelmed by complex peripherals and too-many-settings.I'd also recommend starting with C, rather than trying to mess around with Rust. Rust (and embassy) are great for building apps with very few runtime bugs, but debugging stuff in the Rust async world is a headache, and you've got an abstraction layer sitting between you and the chip.It's actually really powerful to realise that a peripheral is just 10 memory addresses, and to make it work you just need to define a C struct and point it to the start address. Suddenly you're talking to the peripheral and can configure it. None of that is obvious with layers of middleware and abstractions.",

The flip side is that their errata is lengthy, the Rust HAL is complex to support lots of different designs under the same product names, the documentation from STM is poorly organized and spread out over a zillion different documents, and Mac compatibility needs a gigantic asterisk.  You can also get a BlackPill (get the F411 version with 8MB flash) off of AliExpress for $0.99 from WeAct's official store.  Unlike STM's own dev boards (Nucleo) you'll need a separate debug probe. Nucleos that'll give you a lot of breathing room can be had for $10-15.RP is also cheap and has that pretty sweet programmable GPIO and documentation that everyone seems to love.  Adafruit has an RP2040 Feather for $12, RP2350 for $15, or with an ESP32-C6 (RISC-V) for $15.  NXP has chips with similarly programmable GPIO but they're not well supported by Rust.  The RP's PIO stuff is bonkers and potentially very interesting if you wanted to make random protocol dongles.  VGA out? Why not?Nordic stuff looks pretty sweet (and their Bluetooth support seems well loved) but is generally a bit expensive.  Dev boards are available from micro:bit and Adafruit, among others.I've been working on a HAL for an older Atmel SoC and absolutely loved the documentation.  But Atmel stuff is expensive.  Quality of the Chinese clones is iffy.  I set myself back a bit by bricking my one board but am hoping to have a beta release in a month or so.More recent Atmel/Microchip stuff (D21, D51, E51) has a HAL that the Embassy folks seem to have overlooked.  You can get them on Adafruit boards at varying price points.Or just pick something unsupported and start writing a HAL.  It's a great way to get up close and personal with how everything fits together.The one thing I wouldn't do is get some high end thing to start with.  Teensy's (NXP i.MXRT) pack a lot of punch but even their native Arduino libs don't really let you exploit the power.

And developing those skills has always been the goal of CS education.Or, more bluntly, are you going to hire the junior with excellent LLM skills, or are you going to hire the junior with excellent LLM skills and excellent technical problem-solving skills?But they do have to be able to use these tools in the modern workplace so we do cover some of that kind of usage. Believe me, though, they are pretty damned good at it without our help. The catch is when students use it in a cheating way and don't develop those problem-solving skills and then are screwed when it comes time to get hired.So our current thinking is there's no real shortcut other than busting your ass like always. The best thing LLMs offer here is the ability to act as a tutor, which does really increase the speed of learning.",

It encourages dependence and self-centeredness. It's criminal and produces a class of people that will pay the salaries of therapists for decades.The opposite extreme is parental absenteeism which is like a football match without a referee. Someone always influences children - their habits, their worldview, their attitudes - and if a parent isn't doing that, then someone else is, and perhaps not someone who should. Absenteeism is thus a dereliction of parental duty, as parents serve as examples from whom children learn, even more by how they behave and live than by what they say. We are social animals, and a healthy family life produces healthy people.And by following this middle path well, you also teach your children to be able to be appropriately helpful to others themselves and in this manner, able to discern when help is appropriate and when it is not.

I have an external emotion classification model driving both the LLM's persona and the TTS output so it stays relatively consistent.

      "content": "I wanted to run markdown files like shell scripts. So I built an open source tool that lets you use a shebang to pipe them through Claude Code with full stdin/stdout support.task.md:    #!/usr/bin/env claude-run\n\n    Analyze this codebase and summarize the architecture.\n\nThen:    chmod +x task.md\n\n    ./task.md\n\nThese aren't just prompts. Claude Code has tool use, so a markdown file can run shell commands, write scripts, read files, make API calls. The prompt orchestrates everything.A script that runs your tests and reports results (`run_tests.md`):    #!/usr/bin/env claude-run --permission-mode bypassPermissions\n\n    Run ./test/run_tests.sh and summarize what passed and failed.\n\nBecause stdin/stdout work like any Unix program, you can chain them:    cat data.json | ./analyze.md > results.txt\n\n    git log -10 | ./summarize.md\n\n    ./generate.md | ./review.md > final.txt\n\nOr mix them with traditional shell scripts:    for f in logs/\\*.txt; do\n\n        cat \"$f\" | ./analyze.md >> summary.txt\n\n    done\n\nThis replaced a lot of Python glue code for us. Tasks that needed LLM orchestration libraries are now markdown files composed with standard Unix tools. Composable as building blocks, runnable as cron jobs, etc.One thing we didn't expect is that these are more auditable (and shareable) than shell scripts. Install scripts like `curl -fsSL https://bun.com/install | bash` could become:    `curl -fsSL https://bun.com/install.md | claude-run`\n\nWhere install.md says something like \"Detect my OS and architecture, download the right binary from GitHub releases, extract to ~/.local/bin, update my shell config.\" A normal human can actually read and verify that.The (really cool) executable markdown idea and auditability examples are from Pete Koomen (@koomen on X). As Pete says: \"Markdown feels increasingly important in a way I'm not sure most people have wrapped their heads around yet.\"We implemented it and added Unix pipe semantics. Currently works with Claude Code - hoping to support other AI coding tools too. You can also route scripts through different cloud providers (AWS Bedrock, etc.) if you want separate billing for automated jobs.GitHub: https://github.com/andisearch/claude-switcherWhat workflows would you use this for?",

Nondeterministic output also clearly has a significant impact on auditability.The balance between readability and determinism for auditability partly relates to developer philosophy. Tech is famous for religious arguments. I have friends who hate AI coding, and want to avoid nondeterminstic tools at all costs. And other friends whose productivity has increased significantly, and who see the future of programming as natural language.The quality of AI models and tools like Claude Code is improving fast, and there are many developers who find value in them, myself included. I built this to make life easier for developers who want to use AI tools for automation.I find it much faster to parse and understand plain language than many code scripts I've seen. It was one of Python's great insights that people spend more time reading code than writing it. And there is a tradeoff in auditability between determinism and the ability to quickly read and understand what systems do.There are clearly many people who find AI useful, and who are becoming skilled in its use as a tool. This is just a little tool that I put together for myself and other people who fall in that basket.Learning where to use AI tools appropriately - how to constrain the dangers while maximizing the value - is part of the challenge. From using this particular tool for real work, it fits some use cases well, and can make things easier both to understand and share, as well as to write.I hope it's useful for some other people wanting to use AI for scripting and automation.I think that quickly understandable instructions are part of auditability. Not the whole thing, and their use needs to be balanced with safety and security. But an important part of it.I accept there are plenty of folks who don't see AI tools that way. We're sharing this for people who see the value in this new approach, even though it is a fast-moving field and there are a lot of imperfections.Any reasonably competent Claude Code user who is careful about setting permissions boundaries is no more going to delete their hard drive than a competent command line user would. There will be things that go wrong with AI, as before it.In years of tech support, I've personally had to help people who neutered their Windows install or deleted files they needed. Those things happen and I'd argue they come down to skill issues, with AI or without. New tools have a learning curve.I get that you think that's bizarre to see readability with AI-based tools as more auditable, and I really do understand that perspective.",

So you could create another text-based format yourself and use it in theory.I think the reasons Markdown is appealing include:- It's just a text file.- LLMs like Claude have high comprehension of the format, so Claude Code does very well with it.- You can mix structured and unstructured text, and code with plain language: YAML frontmatter, outline/headings, code blocks, tables, links and images etc.I used a heavily condensed version of the example prompt that Pete Koomen posted about as a simplified example, so that's really just me cutting it back to the most simple form of the concept.In real-use it would be detailed, verbose and specific, and include the actual code blocks and external shell script references to retrieve and execute. So this really is just a proof of concept to give an idea of the sort of thing that people could create in future.I know lots of us developers joke about getting the sack and losing out to AI. But for what it's worth, the sorts of points you raise are exactly why I think skilled developers become even more valuable than ever with AI.Programming will change massively this next decade. But it has many times even in my life. So I'm definitely in the camp that thinks this is a new programming abstraction level, and Claude Code and Codex and others are useful tools that improve the productivity of skilled coders. Especially when they are used carefully and thoughtfully.",

By default the runnable markdown files do not have permission to execute code, unless you specifically add those permissions.I can see there might be valid arguments for enforcing file type associations for execution at the OS level. These are just text files, and Unix-like environments support making text files executable with a shebang as a universal convention.I am a fan of that unix-like philosophy generally: tools that try to do a single thing well, can be chained together, and allow users to flexibly create automations using plain text. So I tried to stick with that approach for these scripts.I'm a bear of little brain, and prompt engineering makes my head hurt. So part of the motivation was to be able to save prompts and collections of prompts once I've got them working, and then execute on demand.

And GameFAQs and newsgroups got pretty far with plain text and ASCII graphics.The problem is that people want to use a web browser to display their documents, they want rich documents, and web browsers are awful at displaying text they don't understand the structure for. And <code> tags look consistently awful when read back, which is why we so strongly prefer syntax highlighting when we read XML or HTML.Really, the big competition was BBCode, whose main problem is that it's too much like HTML, and Wikitext, whose main problem was that it's too bare-bones and domain-specific. The big advantages of Markdown are:1. It's simply more readable. It pulls from how people were naturally formatting plain-text documents meant to be read as plain text rather than pulling from markup languages, so it more closely matches how people want to write documents in plain text. That makes the document easy to read while you're writing it. Asterisks for highlighting is an old convention, so were dashes and asterisks for bullets. Really, it made the asterisk an English punctuation mark for emphasis, which I think it genuinely is now.2. It was easy to parse and short, which made it popular with Web 2.0 social media. It got picked up by Slashdot, Reddit, and Stack Overflow as \"good enough\" and \"better than BBCode\" for user generated content. Nobody liked using WYSIWYG editor boxes then, either. They were slow, buggy, and were often Flash-based before HTML5. They needed plain text formatting options, and BBCode was both annoyingly unnatural to type (just like HTML tags) and a little inflexible.And nobody wanted to repeat MySpace and just let users use HTML.

It didn't get popularized as an alternative to other markup languages until long after markdown became popular.I don't really know. I wasn't around back then to watch it unfold.

Electronics being \"the thing that smart university people do\" in the West is mostly a mental block, culturally constructed because people don't want their kids getting electrocuted so bombard them with constant threat of death if playing with electricity (which mostly isn't a worry anymore unless you're working with mains power).The true discipline of Electronic Engineering is designing something that works for every eventuality and environment, with close to 100% reliability, at the very cutting edge of what is possible with the components we can afford while balancing physical and financial constraints.

I use it in pen mode (where the area of the tablet maps to the screen) - you can also configure it in mouse mode (like a touchpad, where the movement is relative to where the cursor is on the screen) which should work better with multi-display setups, though it's not to my preference. I have my pen/stylus setup so that tapping it onto the tablet acts as a left/primary click, the larger button on the pen is right click, and holding the smaller button and dragging on the tablet is scroll/pan).MacOS is well-supported once the drivers are installed, though sometimes the driver doesn't seem to pick up tablet (either after the laptop or tablet goes to sleep). Restarting the driver fixes this, though this bug seems to have been fixed in the latest driver release. Linux works out of the box (at least on KDE/Arch), though sadly customization support on Wayland isn't quite there yet compared with what you could do on X11 (with the xsetwacom utility). For drawing support though it should work perfectly but as far as I know you can't the the button functionality, which is a bummer when using it as a pointing device.The main benefit for me is that it feels much more ergonomic compared with a regular mouse or even a vertical mouse or trackball and I don't get anywhere near as much wrist or shoulder pain - especially in the cold temps in the middle of winter where I am. There is a bit of an adjustment period and I find for interacting with small UI elements such as buttons it can be a bit tricky, but for me the benefits outweigh the downsides. The only other downside I can think of is that when using the tablet over bluetooth (wired is also an option and tracks a little more smoothly) the battery only lasts 1½ days compared with the weeks/months a wireless mouse would go for.",

I configure left click to be done by touching the tablet with the stylus and the 2 buttons that are on the stylus to generate right click and double left click.The advantage over a mouse or trackball is the much more comfortable position of the hand and also the much higher speed and accuracy of positioning. Moving the pointer to any location on the screen is instantaneous and without any effort, due the lightness of the stylus and to the lack of contact with the tablet.Because the stylus is extremely light, I can touch type on the keyboard while still keeping the stylus between my fingers. This allows faster transitions between keyboard and graphic pointer than with a standard mouse (because the time needed to grip the mouse is eliminated). Only when I type longer texts, I drop the stylus on the tablet.The tablet is no bigger than a traditional mouse pad, so it does not need a bigger space on the desk.After switching to use exclusively a graphic tablet, I would never want to use again a mouse, trackball, trackpoint or touchpad. I only regret that I have never thought earlier to try this.Besides being a better mouse than a mouse, a tablet obviously allows to do things for which a mouse is inappropriate, e.g. drawing or handwriting (e.g. for signing a document).I should mention that I have always used the Wacom tablets with Linux.

I had already been programming in 6502 assembly language and was frustrated that I didn’t understand the hardware side of things as much as I understood the software side of things. Best decision I made. It allowed me to view computation as something more abstract. The barrier between hardware and software processing is artificial and can be moved one way or the other. What is CPU microcode, for instance, hardware or software? It’s really low level software that is typically burned into a ROM but is also sometimes downloaded. Even if you decide to stay with software as your primary day to day job, you’ll be comfortable talking to engineers on the other side of the line and that will help inform your understanding of what’s possible, how much it will cost to design and ship it, how long it will take, and how it will perform.",

No artist in the world needs a 8KHz polling rate tablet let alone 1KHz. Tablets from other brands are much better suited for drawing.\n While the basic idea of a rectangle you put a pen on is the same for artists and osu! players, the more detailed requirements are basically oppositesBasically:- Pen click is useless for osu! or can just be digital, while artists would want analog pressure- Buttons on a pen are actively detrimental for osu! but very useful for artists- Smoothing on a tablet is more detrimental for osu! the more of it there is but absolutely necessary for artists- High polling rate is useless for artists (they would have input delay due to the smoothing they need either way) but very useful for osu!- Big tablets are useless for osu! players as they typically only use a 5-15cm area while they are very useful for artistsI think the entire point of something like pompyboard is to make a tablet just for osu!, which doesn’t exist right now. Meanwhile for artists there is already a whole industry of tablets available for them",

          "content": "> Honestly, just pick up the Art of ElectronicsI got this advice in 1998. I have the book. I found it useful for the \"art\" part. It got me through the projects that I was working on at the time, but personally it didn't help me with the fundamentals. Paraphrasing what has been said on this site many times in the past: AoE is a great first book in practical electronics if you already have an undergraduate degree in physics. I showed my brother AoE when he was building guitar pedals and he couldn't make sense of it and said it was obviously assuming things that he didn't know (he had no high-school science background).There are a lot of potential and/or assumed pre-requistites even for basic electronics: high school physics, first-year calculus, maybe a differential equations course, certainly familiarity with complex numbers. As I understand it EEs take vector calculus and classical electromagnetism, that's a long road for self-study. For that reason it's hard to give general advice about where to begin.For someone starting out I think the first things to study are DC and then AC analysis of passive circuits (networks of resistors, capacitors, inductors), starting with networks of resistors. Ohms Law, what current and voltage actually mean, some basic introduction to the physics passive components. This is the basics, and I don't see AoE getting anyone over this hump. This could be learnt in many ways, electronics technicians and amateur radio people know this stuff -- there are no doubt courses outside university both on line and in person. If we're talking books, get a second hand copy of Grob's \"Basic Electronics.\" Once that's covered you can move on to semiconductors. I can recommend Malvino's \"Electronic Principles,\" but this book won't teach you about resistors, capacitors and inductors. After that I think the Art of Electronics would be approachable. And also more specialised topics like digital design or operational amplifier circuits.A book that usually gets a mention is Paul Scherz \"Practical Electronics for Inventors.\" I got that book later, I personally found it a bit overwhelming with the mixture of really basic practical stuff combined with more advanced circuit theory, but it's no doubt popular for a reason.Another standard recommendation is to buy one ARRL Handbook from each decade (I have 1988), the older ones have less advanced (hence more accessible) material. But reading the \"Electronics Fundamentals\" chapter is no substitute for Grob and Malvino.",

Connect the fun doohikie to give feedback to the microcontroller — e.g. using some kind of an encoder chip that converts motor's rotation amount to numbers that will tell the microcontroller how much to move, initialize the doohikie's start state.But you can understand a lot more if you don't use the HBridge chip  for the motor. Build the bridge circuit yourself. Build your own power supply for the microcontroller too(if you want to).You can pick a path to go down on and focus on specific parts:1. For the h bridge there is lots to learn. Designing the operational amp for D2A conversion as well as amplification/signal modeling — which you will need for the motor for current limiting in the h bridge per motor spec for the doohickie you want to power —  That will teach you quite a bit about analog electronics and design.  What kind of currents you need to protect and how e.g. using opto electronics. Limiting noise from power supply and parasitic noise so that your circuit does not misfire. You will likely need a set up of an oscilloscope, soldering irons and breadboards to prototype. Learn some basics from a book about design then go back to the circuit and build.2. If you build your own PCB for this. It is a multi month project. You can learn a out CAD and chip layout. But I think you can do this in parts for example you can design the initial PCB only for the digital components and then connect it to a breadboard where you can prototype the H bridge you want.3. If you choose to learn digital design and embedded system programming then maybe you can build the tougher analog parts for motor control using store-bought components and chips and focus mostly on the programming the microcontroller. That is a totally legitimate part too. You could use an old MCS-51 microcontroller and learn about data and program memory addressing and interrupt handling from scratch.",

The human head has at most 200,000 hairs. Show that there must be at least 3 people in Boston who have the same number of hairs on their head.Each non-bald Bostonian must have a hair count between 1 and 200,000. The average number of such people per hair count is 500,000 / 200,000  = 2.5. The maximum is at least that; moreover, it must be a round number. So the maximum >= 3. QED.",

That’s surprising to me because I’ve only heard of the well-ordering theorem by Zermelo, which is a fundamental theorem in set theory, stating that any set has a well-ordering assuming the axiom of choice. It’s amazing and mind-bending in its own right (imagine a well-ordering for reals), but is clearly not very relevant to computer science.I find the well-ordering principle slightly bewildering. It seems to presuppose the existence of an ordering on natural numbers and then prove this principle. But I’ve never been taught things this way; you always construct the natural numbers from Peano and define the ordering first, then you can actually prove the well-ordering principle rather than leaving it as an axiom.",

When I first did that, I did this installation-y art thing at the Barbican with a remote orchestra. [The song] was made on my Disklavier [controlled piano], which was swung from the roof at that gig, and there was this massive Doppler effect. It is pretty mental. There's a bad cameraphone version of it on YouTube, but in the flesh it's fucking amazing. To listen to this piano swinging, you almost see all the notes stretching out, so it'll hit you at different times. I never knew if it was going to work or not, and everyone was like, “What the fuck is he swinging a piano for?” But when we actually got it going, we were just like, “fucking hell.” It was so extreme. My friends were like, “Are the strings stretching?” The pitch deviation is that big, it sounds like the actual frame is contorting. Maybe it is, I don't know!\"\n- Richard D.
