      "abstract": "该讨论围绕欧洲风能与太阳能发电量超越化石燃料的新闻展开。核心争议点在于数据的解读方式：有用户指出报道中的“发电量”与“总能源消耗”存在差异，因为电力仅占欧洲总能源消耗的一部分，交通、供暖等领域仍依赖化石燃料。同时，部分用户对标题的准确性提出质疑，认为过往类似报道常存在限定条件（如仅对比煤炭或单日数据）。讨论中提到，尽管存在统计口径的争议，多数用户仍认可可再生能源发展的积极趋势，特别是太阳能和风能成本下降带来的竞争力。也有用户推荐相关分析，预测可再生能源将按“S曲线”快速取代传统能源。此外，有评论提及美国政策对风电发展的影响，以及电池技术提升对太阳能应用的推动作用。整体上，社区在肯定可再生能源进展的同时，强调需区分电力与整体能源结构的变化。",

This is only about electricity generation, not total power consumption.Nowadays, for very energy intenive things like heating or driving a car, fossil fuels still are more prevalent than electric alternatives. Once demand shifts in favor of the electrified alternatives, electricity demand is continuing to raise (although not as steep as the drop in demand for the fossil fuels will be). Particularly in heating, where peak demand is in times with very little solar generation, it seems like this will be challenging.While the prices of energy storage have come down significantly and are projected to continue to drop, there is still a noteable lack of cost effective long term storage solutions.",

          "content": "It can be rather misleading to to talk about renewable energy generation versus total energy usage.Most uses of fossil fuels are very inefficient. For instance, when you step on the accelerator in your car, only around 30% of the energy in the fuel you use actually is being used to propel you forward. The majority of the energy is wasted as heat. In a power plant that's more like 70% being captured and going towards the goal (electricity generation).Another large quantity of energy-usage is heating, and electrical heat-pumps can be around 3-5x more energy efficient at heating an enclosed space than combustion or resistive heating.So while things like heating an transportation use a very large amount of energy, conquering them with renewables actually won't require that Europe installs 10x or whatever more wind and solar, since electrification also brings significant new efficiencies.______If you want to compare renewables against the amount of fossil fuels being burnt, then it'd be a lot more representative if you calculate the amount of wind energy impacting a wind turbine blade, or the amount of energy in solar radiation incident on a solar panel.

          "content": "What you're talking about is commonly called \"curtailment\", where power generators like wind and solar can be told to basically stop feeding into the grid, effectively wasting their energy.From what I recall, curtailment of wind and solar at least in Germany amounts to about 3% wasted energy from those sources, so no, it's not a very significant worry. These renewable sources really are displacing fossil fuels.A big part of this story is batteries. Especially during the summer, the wholesale electricity price in Germany can swing daily from -10 to +10 cents per kWh during the mid-day, up to 150+ cents per kWh at night, due to supply-and-demand.This gradient in prices creates a huge incentive for people to build batteries that buy up cheap electricity during the day (sometimes literally getting paid to do so), so that they can sell it back later on in the day when prices rise. This incentive helps make sure energy does not get wasted, it encourages more batteries to be installed, and it encourages businesses to shift the their energy usage to times of the day that align with high renewable output.",

The problem is that while the sun shines, solar will drive everyone else out of business, but then leaves you stranded in the winter, and no practical amount of electricity storage will save you.Fortunately, wind energy generation also exists, and is a nearly ideal complement to solar power, because it's nearly as cheap as solar, and its energy peaks are mostly anti-correlated with solar energy peaks (typically the winter and sunset are the windiest parts of the year / day).Wind's main problem is that it's more reliant on large scale projects (rather than solar which scales all the way from a pocket calculator to an installation the size of city), and wind is also more susceptible to regulatory / NIMBY sabotage than solar.Especially with China currently flooding the market with cheap solar and batteries, I think it makes sense for governments to focus much more of their attention and efforts on promoting (or at least getting out of the way of) wind projects, and let the market drive solar adoption.",

Solar isn't the only incredibly cheap form of intermittant renwewable energy production. Wind is also great, tends to support local manufacturing economies more than solar, and is anti-correlated with peak-sunshine. The wind tends to blow hardest in the winter and around sunset.2. Heatpumps can pretty comfortably achieve 300+% coefficients of performance, meaning that for every joule of energy you put into a heatpump, you'll get 3+ joules of heat pumped into your home, office, or city-scale heat thermos3. Heat energy storage is cheap compared to batteries. You just store large quantities of water or sand and heat it up with a resistor or a heat pump. The scaling of surface area versus volume  ensures that the bigger you make the heat-battery, the less energy you'll lose from it over time (percentage wise).4. Heat is a waste product from many other forms of energy usage, and can be harnessed. For instance, gas peaker plants aren't going away any time soon, and cities which aren't harnessing the waste heat from those peaker plants and using it in a district heating system are wasting both money and carbon.Just a couple kilometers from my home for instance is a gas power plant that stores waste heat in giant thermoses, and pumps hot water to my building to to be used for heating. They currently have the largest heat pump in europe under construction on the same site intended to supplement the gas plant, both to take up slack from the fact that it'll be running less often, and to expand the service to yet more households.",

How can a battery pay for itself with 10-20 discharges a year?

The alternative is overbuilding solar+wind+battery something like 5/8 times the average need. Maybe if the prices drop enough that could be feasible..\nThe big win would be if there is some way to get predictable power at a lower cost than nuclear (e.g. tidal), which could be used to smooth the troughts, or alternatively a low capex but potentially high opex solution which is turned on only when needed (gas is an option, but not co2 free.

That said, the \"single error\" papers in the dataset seem similar to the one I checked: relatively harmless and minor errors (which would be immediately caught by a DOI checker), and so I have to assume some of these were included in the dataset mainly to amplify the author's product pitch.

In previous years, we piloted policies regarding the use of LLMs, and in 2025, reviewers were instructed to flag hallucinations. Regarding the findings of this specific work, we emphasize that significantly more effort is required to determine the implications. Even if 1.1% of the papers have one or more incorrect references due to the use of LLMs, the content of the papers themselves are not necessarily invalidated. For example, authors may have given an LLM  a partial description of a citation and asked the LLM to produce bibtex (a formatted reference).

First discovered by z\".Most people (that I talk to, at least) in science agree that there's a reproducibility crisis. The challenge is there really isn't a good way to incentivize that work.Fundamentally (unless you're independent wealthy and funding your own work), you have to measure productivity somehow, whether you're at a university, government lab, or the private sector. That turns out to be very hard to do.If you measure raw number of papers (more common in developing countries and low-tier universities), you incentivize a flood of junk. Some of it is good, but there is such a tidal wave of shit that most people write off your work as a heuristic based on the other people in your cohort.So, instead it's more common to try to incorporate how \"good\" a paper is, to reward people with a high quantity of \"good\" papers. That's quantifying something subjective though, so you might try to use something like citation count as a proxy: if a work is impactful, usually it gets cited a lot. Eventually you may arrive at something like the H-index, which is defined as \"The highest number H you can pick, where H is the number of papers you have written with H citations.\" Now, the trouble with this method is people won't want to \"waste\" their time on incremental work.And that's the struggle here; even if we funded and rewarded people for reproducing results, they will always be bumping up the citation count of the original discoverer. But it's worse than that, because literally nobody is going to cite your work. In 10 years, they just see the original paper, a few citing works reproducing it, and to save time they'll just cite the original paper only.There's clearly a problem with how we incentivize scientific work. And clearly we want to be in a world where people test reproducibility.

It can form a barrier to real understanding, and keeps me out of my flow.I recently worked on something very complex I don't think I would have been able to tackle as quickly without AI; a hierarchical graph layout algorithm based on the Sugiyama framework, using Brandes-Köpf for node positioning. I had no prior experience with it (and I went in clearly underestimating how complex it was), and AI was a tremendous help in getting a basic understanding of the algorithm, its many steps and sub-algorithms, the subtle interactions and unspoken assumptions in it. But letting it write the actual code was a mistake. That's what kept me from understanding the intricacies, from truly engaging with the problem, which led me to keep relying on the AI to fix issues, but at that point the AI clearly also had no real idea what it was doing, and just made things worse.So instead of letting the AI see the real code, I switched from the Copilot IDE plugin to the standalone Copilot 365 app, where it could explain the principles behind every step, and I would debug and fix the code and develop actual understanding of what was going on. And I finally got back into that coding flow again.So don't let the AI take over your actual job, but use it as an interactive encyclopedia. That works much better for this kind of complex problem.",

The three pillars of learning are theory (finding out about the thing), practice (doing the thing) and metacognition (being right, or more importantly, wrong. And correcting yourself.).

But they don't come into effect into any of those processes. So it's an immensely bad metaphor. A more apt one is the GPS, that only leaves you with practice.That's where LLMs come in, and obliterate every single one of those pillars on any mental skill. You never have to learn a thing deeply, because it's doing the knowing for you. You never have to practice, because the LLM does all the writing for you. And of course, when it's wrong, you're not wrong. So nothing you learn.There are ways to exploit LLMs to make your brain grow, instead of shrink. You could make them into personalized teachers, catering to each student at their own rhythm. Make them give you problems, instead of ready-made solutions. Only employ them for tasks you already know how to make perfectly. Don't depend on them.But this isn't the future OpenAI or Anthropic are gonna gift us.

People only create rough drafts and then have their \"editor\" make it coherent.Interestingly, people might start using said editor prompts to express themselves, causing an increased range in distinct writing styles. Despite this, vocabulary and semantics as a whole become more uniform. Spelling errors and typos become increasingly rare.In parallel, people start using LLMs to summarize content in a style they prefer.Both sides of this gradually converge. Content gets explicitly written in a way that is optimized for consumption by an LLM, perhaps a return to something like the semantic web. Authors write content in a way that encourages a summarizing LLM to summarize as the author intends for certain explicit areas.Human languages start to evolve in a direction that could be considered more coherent than before, and perhaps less ambiguous. Language is the primary interface an LLM uses with humans, so even if LLM use becomes baseline for many things, if information is not being communicated effectively then an LLM would be failing at its job.

The three pillars of learning are theory (finding out about the thing), practice (doing the thing) and metacognition (being right, or more importantly, wrong. And correcting yourself.). Each of those steps reinforce neural pathways. They're all essential in some form or another.Literacy, books, saving your knowledge somewhere else removes the burden of remembering everything in your head. But they don't come into effect into any of those processes. So it's an immensely bad metaphor. A more apt one is the GPS, that only leaves you with practice.That's where LLMs come in, and obliterate every single one of those pillars on any mental skill. You never have to learn a thing deeply, because it's doing the knowing for you. You never have to practice, because the LLM does all the writing for you. And of course, when it's wrong, you're not wrong. So nothing you learn.There are ways to exploit LLMs to make your brain grow, instead of shrink. You could make them into personalized teachers, catering to each student at their own rhythm. Make them give you problems, instead of ready-made solutions. Only employ them for tasks you already know how to make perfectly. Don't depend on them.But this isn't the future OpenAI or Anthropic are gonna gift us. Not today, and not in a hundred years, because it's always gonna be more profitable to run a sycophant.If we want LLMs to be the \"better\" instead of the \"worse\", we'll have to fight for it.Yes, I wrote this comment under someone else's comment before, but it seems to apply to yours even better.",

It flags the paper's alarmist findings as \"pseudoscience\" designed to provoke fear rather than provide rigorous insight. They highlight several \"red flags\" in the study's design: lack of a coherent scientific framework, methodological errors like typos, and reliance on invented, undefined terms such as \"cognitive debt\". They challenge the interpretation of EEG results, explaining that while the paper frames a 55% reduction in connectivity as evidence that a user's \"brain sucks,\" such data could instead indicate increased neural efficiency, an alternative explanation the authors ignore. (EEG measures broad, noisy signals from outside the skull and is better understood as a rough index of brain state than as a precise window into specific thoughts or “intelligence.”)The hosts condemn the study’s \"bafflingly weak\" logic and ableist rhetoric, and advise skepticism toward \"science communicators\" who might profit from selling hardware or supplements related to their findings: one of the paper's lead authors, Nataliya Kosmyna, is associated with the MIT Media Lab and the development of AttentivU, a pair of glasses designed to monitor brain activity and engagement. By framing LLM use as creating a \"cognitive debt,\" the researchers create a market for their own solution: hardware that monitors and alerts the user when they are \"under-engaged\". The AttentivU system can provide haptic or audio feedback when attention drops, essentially acting as the \"scaffold\" for the very cognitive deficits the paper warns against. The research is part of the \"Fluid Interfaces\" group at MIT, which frequently develops Brain-Computer Interface (BCI) systems like \"Brain Switch\" and \"AVP-EEG\". This context supports the hosts' suspicion that the paper’s \"cognitive debt\" theory may be designed to justify a need for these monitoring tools.",

A big project that would have been personally intractible is now easy - even if the LLM gives slightly wrong answers 20% of the time, the important thing is that it collapses the search space for what concepts or tools I need to look into and gives an overall structure to iterate on. I tend to use ChatGPT for the big planning/architectural conversation, and I find it's also very good at sample code; for code writing/editing, Copilot has been fantastic too, lately mostly using the Opus agent in my case. It's so nice being able to delegate some bullshit gruntwork to it while I either do something else or work on architecture in another window for a few minutes.It certainly hasn't inhibited learning either. The most recent example is shaders. I started by having it just generate entire shaders based on descriptions, without really understanding the pipeline fully, and asking how to apply them in Unity. I've been generally familiar with Unity for over a decade but never really touched materials or shaders. The generated shaders were shockingly good and did what I asked, but over time I wanted to really fine tune some of the behavior and wound up with multiple passes, compute shaders, and a bunch of other cool stuff - and understanding it all on a deeper level as a result.",

Like you said, it's up to us to determine if they're positive or negative, but as is probably obvious to many, it's difficult to argue for the status quo.If it's a negative change, teachers have to go back to paper-and-pen essay writing, which I was personally never good at.

He bungled his last case so badly it made national news. In an American police procedural, we would either have some mitigating explanation for his failure, or at least some gritty vice or personal demon that was the real reason he got demoted.In Broadchurch, Tennant's character just sucks at his job. Every episode of the show conforms to a formula where he gets suspicious of one of the other characters in the show and we spend the episode wasting time while it's finally determined that the suspect of the week is actually innocent. I have to say, it makes for entertaining television. It also resulted in my wife and I chorusing aloud, every episode, \"he's SO BAD at his job!!\"(Minor Broadchurch spoilers) At the end when he finally catches the big bad, it's not because of anything he did. A coincidence and some carelessness on the part of the big bad lead to the mystery being solved. Also, every other character on the show had already been ruled out.Since watching it we've kept a lookout for protagonists who embody the \"everyman in way over his head who accomplished virtually nothing himself\" archetype. It's fun to know Adams held forth on the very subject.",

This makes them lovable: we appreciate them for this quality that we (most of the audience) do not have.[1]: (or lack of self-awareness, in some other cases mentioned here like Homer Simpson or Peter Griffin)Arthur Dent, on the other hand, is not gifted with undying optimism. He's constantly moaning about things, starting with his house and his planet being destroyed. This makes him relatable more than lovable: he's not a “lovable loser” (and for the right audience, does not seem a “loser” at all), he is just us, “my kind of guy” — we feel kinship rather than appreciation. We relate to the moaning (if Arthur Dent were to remain unfailingly optimistic, he'd be… different), whereas if Charlie Brown were to lose his optimism or if Homer were to say \"D'oh!\" to complain about big things in life rather than hurting his thumb or whatever, they would become less of the endearing American institutions they are IMO.",

I had a very difficult time finding most British humor funny when I was younger, but my personality combination of loving humor and comedy and also being incredibly interested in people, drove me to want to understand why British humor was funny when most of the time it just seemed so absurd.It was a multi-decade path so it's very difficult to identify progression points, but slowly through exposure I began to \"get it\" and now I adore British comedy and humor. I still adore American comedy and humor as well, but the more exposure to the culture I got, the more I understood it.Obviously that's just anecdotal, but I personally find it strong evidence that the humor divide is indeed cultural. The more similar cultures are to begin with, the easier the leap is.To me the most exciting part of this is that it means there are thousands of other cultures on this planet that have humor that I have not unlocked yet. Someday I hope to!Edit: for a very fascinating example of differences, I love comparing the UK version of the office to the US version of the office. To many Americans, David Brent mostly just came off mean and an asshole, even a poisonous one, whereas Michael Scott comes off as eccentric and clueless and unable to read the room, but overall a mostly good guy. That perception makes David Brent kind of hateable whereas Michael Scott kind of lovable.Another fascinating point of comparison is the UK version of ghosts, versus the US version of ghosts. I'll leave comparisons and contrasts on those to others as I haven't watched all of the UK version of ghosts yet. I'd be fascinated to hear what others think of that, and the office for that matter.",

The difference in sales success is down to the fact that JKR got a better US publisher. Scholastic has an unfair advantage in the young adult and graded reader markets called the \"Scholastic Book Fair\". Basically, it's a travelling bookstore event set up in US schools where they sell kids books. If you wanted to start a YA phenomenon in the US, especially back in the 2000s, that was the perfect way to do it.For similar reasons, Bone outsold a good chunk of other western comics purely because of the fact that Scholastic was the only company willing to touch it.Another factor is that its obvious Britishisms come across as fantastical to American audiences. I mean, who in America even knows what a boarding school is? This is the same reason why Naruto did so well in America, even though most of the things that seem unique about its world are just fantastic versions of bog-standard ninja tropes.[0] This is the same reason why Naruto arguably did better in America than in its native Japan.",

What makes the show work in the UK (and Ireland), is a greater cultural willingness to see the worst aspects of reality reflected in entertainment. Versus the focus on escapism in even the most grim US television - i.e.: Tony Soprano is a monster, but he also has charisma and glamour. Walter White is dying and becoming more and more amoral, but he also goes from being a dork to a badass. Both characters are utter glamorisations of what their real life counterparts would be like.

We as viewers get to see the pain this causes and their efforts to improve. It's wholly different than modern US television including all other ST media. Meanwhile, 70s Dr. Who is packed with automatic weapons fire and explosions and the formula has always been the Doctor knows best. (I am a huge fan of all the mentioned shows.)For a good, modern example we can look at Ghosts (suddenly renamed \"Ghosts UK\" on my streaming services) and Ghosts US. The adaptation is agonizing.

Group buying times (who cares?).So I either disable ALL notifications (and have an LLM write a script that crawls searches manually and much more appropriately notifies me on its own), or I enable notifications and get a bunch of trash spam.As it relates to specifically to buying, we’ve known for a long time that we’re all up against some kind of bot that’s timed the exact last moment and amount to outbid us.

Then, you would enable automatic mode, and it would automatically bid/buy any item that someone put up for sale if the price was much lower than normal.You would leave it running overnight, or whatever, then come back to go pick up all the items it bought, and then you would go back to the auction house and sell all your items you bought at the correct price.Basically, you would see buy auctions created by people who didn’t realize what the correct price should be and sold too cheaply. Since this was an automated system, you could beat any human to take advantage of the deal.I made a ton of in game currency doing this.After a few months they changed the auction rules to prevent this… add-ons could no longer directly bid on items, and you had to sit there and click “buy” whenever the script found a good deal.

It does, in fact, work much better. There is still an advantage to bidding very late: there is no disadvantage, and it lowers bids in cases of irrational or imperfect opposing bidders.

This is a marked difference from the expectation that, like a real-world in-person auction, the extending deadline might encourage further spur-of-the-moment bidding.Whether it makes much difference to the final price or not is immaterial though if the buyers believe that it does. This is one of the (several) reasons why eBay won out against similar competition in the early days: buyers felt they were getting a better deal by being able to snipe so favoured eBay with more of their attention and this brought more sellers to the platform (which attracted more buyers, and so on round the loop). It is telling that to deal with the extra load imposed on the system by external bots refreshing pages and putting in automated bids, instead of switching to an extending auction model they implemented what is almost a built-in sniping feature.Auction sites have to be very careful (or just very lucky) in their messaging, to convince both sellers and buyers that they are getting a good deal - any major change to how eBay works could upset the balance that they currently have in that regard and start a flood in the other direction (the more people leave, the more other people will think about leaving) to the building toward critical mass that was how they won out in those early days.",

I wonder if this has to do with eBay's search ranking algorithm or some other irrational behavior that I don't understand. At any rate, bidding with 5 or less seconds left to go seems to defeat the above behaviors. I find it distasteful and irrational but it works so I put up with it.eBay's reputation and trust network is really what makes it a viable product at this point.

Os.The situation in windows (windows 10 at the time) was abysmal. Completely incoherent UI, settings spread across different menus, ads in start menu, slow and broken search, constant nagging to update windows, to update the drivers, to tell me that the drivers have been updated, to install or update my antivirus, etc. These were not things that I installed myself, these were included with Dell's setup of the machine.On the system76 laptop things were different. Things were calm, I could configure everything as I wanted and things worked. Until at some point I installed a new version of something, which had nothing to do with sound, but it broke sound, just as I was preparing to join a meeting, and just as we were going into the second phase of lockdowns in late 2020 so online meetings were here to stay.My macbooks are reliable. I've got the M1 as soon as it came out and I never got a single issue with it. I've upgraded twice (I think) across major versions and everything worked. I don't have to worry about it leaving me hanging when I need it.(And that's not taking into account things like build quality, touchpad quality, battery life, silence, etc)In the end of the day, I do a lot of debugging as part of my work. When I don't work, I want to choose what I will be debugging, not have it forced on me.And don't get me wrong: I see where Apple is going, I know that they're a greedy company that want to maintain their iron grip and have the final say on what we can and cannot do on our machines.However, for me for the time being it's the least bad option.",

          "content": "I suspect that Oakley could have explained that, but the thesis stands even without the asterisk, and explaining it would have an issue:This is going to piss off some Linux folks, but when communicating from a big pulpit about how to bypass parts of MacOS, it's important to be aware that the vast majority of MacOS users are casual, nontechnical users. As such, a popular blog posting \"here's how to bypass SIP/SSV lock/whatever\" would lead to a wave of users disabling it for less-than-great reasons (aesthetics, conviction that e.g. a given service was causing their system slowness when that service's resource usage was actually symptomatic of something else orchestrated by MacOS going wrong). Those decisions have side effects:- Folks brick or break their computers, potentially in a way that voids the warranty or support contracts (I hope that software bypasses don't trigger this, but I am cynical).- Folks chasing a \"cleanliness vibe\" leave a lot of the system security off once they're done. Someone else in this thread pointed out that without SSV the security of MacOS is on par with most Linux, but MacOS users are a lot bigger attack risk than Linux users: there are more of them, they're wealthier and thus identified as targets of choice by malware/people, and, again--they're casual users and don't have good security spider sense. This isn't a blanket endorsement of every restriction/security feature with no opt-out that MacOS has, just an observation that its userbase is at higher risk for attack than some others--lower than windows, but higher than Linux users.- Folks induce breakage that bricks their computers on a delay, e.g. during the next system update something chokes after encountering a totally unauthorized/unexpected service geometry and crashes hard enough to cause data loss.I'm not saying that stuff like SSV-rw should be secret, just that it's probably for the best to not discuss it front and center in a widely-read informational blog whose content is geared towards (power) users rather than technicians. To phrase it with a different example: if someone Googles \"how to disable XProtect (antimalware)\", great, go nuts. But it's probably for the best that a popular article about \"can you reduce resource usage by shutting down system launchd services\" doesn't have a \"here's how to elevate your permissions and disable whatever you like\" blurb, and instead settles for an answer of \"no, that's not supported.\"",

And, if you use something like NixOS, you generally only have to do it once since the idea of \"reinstalling\" the OS (e.g. for new versions) largely goes away: subsequent effort is just about changing your mind about what software you want, or what version you want (as with any OS).",

Assuming Activity Monitor is more or less accurate, the culprit seems to be those two, who always have massive amounts of accumulated CPU time, but never seem to actually be using CPU when watched. I suspect, given what they supposedly do, that they're also needlessly exhausting SSD write cycles, but that's harder to analyze/prove. Naturally, they are also in the untouchable area of the file system.

Maybe if I hadn't had a personal laptop that used Linux at the same time, I would have gotten used to it a little better, but I just plain hated the way it worked.To be fair, I think it was still more reliable than varieties of Windows, especially the later ones! If tabbing worked more like under Windows and it allowed a bit more configuration, I might be using Mac these days.That leaves Linux. Although it's not flawless neither after configuring Debian + i3, it works exactly like I want and the same installation has been reliably working for 5+ years.     However, getting to the setup that just works certainly took several tries and depends on laptop compatibility, so... No ideal choices exist right now I think.

Tried general software design questions, asking about problems he solved, his preferences on the way of working, consistently felt like he didn't have much to argue, if he did at all.Long story short, I sent a feedback email the day later saying that we had issues evaluating him properly, suggested to trim his CV with topics he liked more to talk about instead of risking being asked about stuff he no longer remembered much. And finally I suggested to always come prepared with insights of software or human problems he solved as they can tell a lot about how he works because it's a very common question in pretty much all interview processes.God forbid, he threw the biggest tantrum on a career subreddit and linkedin, cherrypicking some of my sentences and accusing my company and me to be looking for the impossible candidate, that we were looking for a team and not a developer, and yada yada yada. And you know the internet how quickly it bandwagons for (fake) stories of injustice and bad companies.It then became obvious to me why corporate lingo uses corporate lingo and rarely gives real feedback.

You're warned when you open a folder whether you trust the origin/authors with pretty strong wording. Sure you may find this annoying, but it's literally a security warning in a giant modal that forces you to chose.Even if automatic tasks were disabled by default, you'd still be vulnerable if you trust the workspace. VS Code is an IDE and the core and extensions can execute code based on files within the folder in order to provide rich features like autocomplete, compilation, run tests, agentic coding, etc.Before workspace trust existed, we started noticing many extensions and core features having their own version of workspace trust warnings popping up. Workspace trust unified this into a single in your face experience. It's perfectly fine to not trust the folder, you'll just enter restricted mode that will protect you and certain things will be degraded like language servers may not run, you don't be able to debug (executes code in vscode/launch.json), etc.Ultimately we're shipping developer tool that can do powerful things like automating project compilation or dependency install when you open a folder. This attack vector capitalizes on neglectful developers that ignore a scary looking security warning. It certainly happens in practice, but workspace trust is pretty critical to the trust model of VS Code and is also an important part to improve the UX around it as we annoy you a _single_ time when you open the folder, not several times from various components using a JIT notification approach. I recall many discussions happening around the exact wording of the warning, it's a difficult to communicate concept in the small amount of words that it needs to use.My recommendation is to use the check box to trust the parent or configure trusted folders. I personally have all my safe git clones in a dev/ folder which I configured to trust, but I also have a playground/ folder where I put random projects that I don't know much about and decide at the time I open something.",

So this is a little worse than installing malicious packages: the trigger is opening a malicious repository from the editor. Is this a common practice?

Instead of disallowing dangerous features you're enabling only the features you need.So a build system like Gradle or Maven (same thing really) has a limited set of primitives it is allowing access to. It's not loading, say, the entire JVM and all the Java core libraries and then listing all those you can't use.You see the difference? If nothing else, the blacklist approach is going to fail when the virtual machine (or whatever) adds a new API call upstream and it's added without intent to the sandbox by simply doing an update where nobody has thought to disable it.Another way of looking at this is Gradle isn't being compiled into Java bytecode and run in the same environment as the IDE (sandboxed or otherwise).

And it didn't really support anything except Java.Interestingly Java is the only language that I've found vscode support poor, so I keep buying Idea license exclusively for Java projects. For rest of languages that I use (JS/TS, Go, Python, Shell, YAML, XML) I'm using vscode and happy about it.In recent years vscode starting to get bloated, mostly with AI stuff. But so far I can disable everything AI with a single setting and it works good afterwards. I'd prefer for all AI features to be contained in a separate plugin that I can just not install, but I guess managers these days want to shove AI in everyone's throat.Another good thing about vscode is that its written with JavaScript and can be launched in browser, so in the future I want to put my development environment in the browser, but so far I didn't do that.",

(highly team dependent, I was mostly on older C/C++ code bases.)Some teams at MS paid for an editor called Source Insight, which indexed your code and could also parse C #defines and other preprocessor macros, which was super unique and powerful. It had an incredibly powerful symbol and fuzzy filename search capabilities, I'd frequently have Source Insight open just so I could find where in a folder structure a file was and then I'd open it up in my preferred editor.Back when I got my first SSD the largest boost to my dev productivity was not in compile times (large C++ code bases tend to template bound more so than IO bound), it was how fast I could find files in the directory structure.I'm sure Vi/Emacs users have some magic set of plugins that do all of this for them, but as someone back on Windows back in the 2000s and 2010s, the supported MS tooling was horrible at all this.Then VS Code comes along with amazing fuzzy file name matching. Holy cow. Sure it is missing 90% of the power of real Visual Studio (being able to have a debugger step from front end web code to your backend and then into stored procedures in SQL, running on a remote machine, that your debugger transparently auth'd to, is something Microsoft had working 20 years ago and would be considered impossible dark magic with today's tooling), but wow can I navigate a project quickly!",

      "abstract": "该讨论围绕SSH协议中每个击键发送大量数据包的现象展开。核心话题是2023年SSH引入的击键计时混淆机制，该机制通过发送大量干扰数据包来防止攻击者通过分析击键间隔推测输入内容。\n\n社区观点呈现明显分歧。有用户支持这一安全改进，指出击键时序分析曾是真实威胁，混淆机制能有效防御；也有用户质疑其性能开销，认为每秒数千数据包消耗20%CPU核心资源的效率过低，反映出代码性能优化不足。讨论中提到，虽然该功能可客户端禁用，但有用户强烈警告在生产环境中禁用可能带来安全风险。\n\n共识在于认可击键时序分析的安全威胁确实存在。主要争议集中在实现方式上：一方认为安全优先值得性能代价，另一方则认为当前实现效率低下，应寻求更优方案。还有用户指出AI辅助调试工具在讨论中被提及，但其实际效用和表达方式也引发了一些争议。",

The big guys already do something similar with HTTP over TLS for DDoS protection and to limit end to end latency on TLS.Granted... it would increase the cost (since you're adding reverse proxies) but it would be a quick way to get acceptable latency, rudimentary DDoS protection, and you could try different connection options independent of the main app's logic.It would be hard to estimate how much latency you're adding with a SSH2 reverse proxy in this case, but it's probably lower than one might think.The idea of letting Claude loose on my crypto[graphy] implementation is about the most frightening thing I've heard of in a while [though libnss is so craptastic, I can't see how it would hurt in that case.]  But I loved this write-up.

Even unaccelerated encryption can do ~2-5 Gbps in pure software which is 4-10x the SSH rate.And in this situation, the amount of encrypted payload in each packet is 36 bytes which is ~40x less than a full packet of ~1500 bytes. You would almost surely hit packet per second limits before you hit payload throughput limits at these small sizes.Encryption is slow when compared to data throughput you can get with a properly designed transport stack, but that is because it is in comparison to 100 Gbps per core even with no hardware offload.

Then you know if there were more the likely keys were in set X, while if there were fewer the likely keys were in set Y.So a clock doesn't solve the problem. The amount of data sent on each clock pulse also tells you something about what was sent.The Chaff packets already fire on a timer. They inject random extra fake keystrokes so you can't tell how many keystrokes were actually made. The only other way I can think of to solve that is by using a step function: Send one larger packet (fragmented or the same number of individual packets) on each clock pulse if the actual data is less than some N where N is the maximum keystrokes ever recorded with some margin. Effectively almost every clock pulse will be one packet (or set of packets) of identical size. Of course if you do that then you'll end up consuming more data over time than sending random amounts of packets.",

And once you see the AI you can't really unsee it.But I didn't want to call it a \"SimCity\" map, though that's really the vibe/inspiration I wanted to capture, because that implies a lot of other things, so I used the term \"pixel art\" even though I figured it might get a lot of (valid) pushback...In general, labels and genres are really hard - \"techno\" to a deep head in Berlin is very different than \"techno\" to my cousins. This issue has always been fraught, because context and meaning and technique are all tangled up in these labels which are so important to some but so easily ignored by others. And those questions are even harder in the age of AI where the machine just gobbles up everything.But regardless, it was a fun project! And to me at least it's better to just make cool ambitious things in good faith and understand that art by definition is meaningful and therefore makes people feel things from love to anger to disgust to fascination.",

You are notating what notes to play, when and for how long they play, what instrument plays them, and any modifications to the default sound of that instrument. Is writing sheet music tedious? Sure, it can be, when the speed of notating by hand can't keep up with the speed your brain is thinking through ideas. But being tedious is not mutually exclusive with being creative despite the attempt to explicitly contrast them as such, and the solution to the process of notating your creativity being tedious is not \"randomly generate a bunch of notes and instruments that have little relation with the ones you're thinking of\". This excerpt supposes that generative AI lets you automate the tedious part while keeping \"the quality of your decisions\", but it doesn't keep your decisions, it generates its own \"decisions\" from a broad, high-level prompt and your role is reduced to merely making decisions about whether or not you like the content generated, which is not creativity.",

You can avoid seams if every new tile can \"see\" all its already-generated neighbors.You get a seam if you generate a new tile next to an old tile but that old tile is not input to the infill agorithm.

In a way it feels a bit like magical roulette, never being quite certain of what you're going to get.

The voice cloning of the 1.7B model captures the tone of the speaker very well, but I found it failed at reproducing the variation in intonation, so it sounds like a monotonous reading of a boring text.I presume this is due to using the base model, and not the one tuned for more expressiveness.edit: Or more likely, the demo not exposing the expressiveness controls.The 1.7B model was much better at ignoring slight background noise in the reference audio compared to the 0.6B model though. The 0.6B would inject some of that into the generated audio, whereas the 1.7B model would not.Also, without FlashAttention it was dog slow on my 5090, running at 0.3X realtime with just 30% GPU usage. Though I guess that's to be expected. No significant difference in generation speed between the two models.Overall though, I'm quite impressed. I haven't checked out all the recent TTS models, but a fair number, and this one is certainly one of the better ones in terms of voice cloning quality I've heard.",

          "content": "I would like to see ReactOS succeed for various reasons, mainly philosophical. On the other hand, for practical real-world use cases, it has to compete with several alternative solutions:1. Just use Windows 11. Yes, it sucks and MS occasionally breaks stuff - but at least hardware and software vendors will develop their code against Win 11 and test it. In other words, you have the highest likelihood that your computer will work as expected with contemporary Windows applications and drivers.2. Use an older version of Windows. If you want to use old hardware or software, odds are you will get the best experience with whatever version of Windows they were developed/tested against. You have to accept the lack of support for modern software, and you will need to take appropriate security measures such as not connecting it to the internet - but at the same time, it's unlikely that your Windows 98 retro gaming rig is your only computer, so that's probably an acceptable tradeoff.3. Run WINE on top of Linux (or some other mature open source operating system). This might not be a good solution for the average person, but ticks the box for people who feel strongly pro-open source, or anti-Microsoft.

Wine is pretty great for Win32 API, Proton completes it with excellent D3D support through DXVK, and with these projects a lot of Windows userspace can run fine on Linux. Wine doesn't do anything for driver compatibility, which is where ReactOS was supposed to fill in, running any driver written for Windows 2000 or XP.But by now, as I also wrote in the other thread on this, ReactOS should be seen as something more like GNU Hurd. An exercise in kernel development and reverse engineering, a project that clearly requires a high level of technical skill, but long past the window of opportunity for actual adoption. If Hurd had been usable by say 1995, when Linux just got started on portability, it would have had a chance. If ReactOS had been usable ten years ago, it would also have had a chance at adoption, but now it's firmly in the \"purely for engineering\" space.",

An exercise in kernel development and reverse engineering, a project that clearly requires a high level of technical skill, but long past the window of opportunity for actual adoption.\"I understand your angle, or rather the attempt of fitting them in the same picture, somehow. However, the differences between them far surpass the similarities. There was no meaningful user-base for Unix/Hurd so to speak of compared to NT kernel. There's no real basis to assert the \"kernel development\" argument for both, as one was indeed a research project whereas the other one is just clean room engineering march towards replicating an existing kernel. What ReactOS needs to succeed is to become more stable and complete (on the whole, not just the kernel). Once it will be able to do that, covering the later Windows capabilities will be just a nice-to-have thing. Considering all the criticism that current version of Windows receives, switching to a stable and functional ReactOS, at least for individual use, becomes a no-brainer. Comparatively, there's nothing similar that Hurd kernel can do to get to where Linux is now.",

I don’t use Loom — I use CleanShot X and it was a one-time $30 payment and has a lot of great features I benefit from. I can’t reimplement it in $30 of tokens or $30 of my time.But for an app whose use case doesn’t change and is recurring for no reason? Yeah there’s probably not much value in recurring payments outside of wanting to support the developer.

Their biggest advantage is that people don't like change, and thus having to e.g. export data from some tools etc. seems to be a hassle not worth $5 a month.\nBut as the models get better and the quality of the output will match the quality of the established SaaS but tailor the whole thing to a single user with the ability to make any change they can imagine within minutes, and perhaps deploy to Hetzner and whatnot where they could host all of those apps for a single $5 instead, the exodus will accelerate.On the other hand, new products will have a much harder time to gather a big userbase. Whenever I'll see a launch of a SaaS asking for $$$, the first question I'll ask myself will be how long it will take LLM to recreate it. And for most cases, I imagine that the time it will take to get 80% of what they have is a few vibe coding sessions (as most newcomers will probably have used LLM themselves to code it up).",

The pre-LLM solutions were in most cases better. Searching a maintained database of curated and checked information is far better than LLM output (which is possibly bullshit).Ditto to software engineering. In software, we have things call libraries: you write the code once, test it, then you trust it and can use it as many times as you want forever for free. Why use LLM generated code when you have a library? And if you're asking for anything complex, you're probably just getting a plagiarized and bastardized version of some library anyway.The only thing where LLMs shine is a kind of simple, lazy \"mash this up so I don't have to think about it\" cases.

I used to work in that field and I'm confident it's not going to change overnight: progress there is slow not because of the models, but because data is sparse and noisy, labels are even sparser and noisier, deployment procedures are rigid and legal compliance is a nightmare.If they mean \"generative AI\", then how is that supposed to work exactly? Asking LLMs for medical diagnosis is no better than asking \"the Internet at large\". They only return the most statistically likely output given their training corpus (that corpus being the Internet as a whole), so it's more likely your diagnosis will be based on a random Reddit comment that the LLMs has ingested somewhere, than an actual medical paper.The only plausible applications I can think of are tasks such as summarizing papers, acting as augmented search engines for datasets and papers, or maybe automating some menial administrative tasks.

          "content": "One thing I like about JPEG-XL is that it supports all kinds of weird image formats.For example, I used to work with depth data a lot, which is best expressed as monochrome 16-bit floating point images. Previously, TIFF was the only format that supported this. Many shops would instead save depth images as UINT16 .PNG files, where the raw pixel intensity maps to the camera distance in mm. The problem with this is that pixels more than 65.535 meters away aren't representable. (Hot take: I personally think this is one reason why nobody studies depth estimation for outdoor scenes.)JPEG-XL supports more weird combinations here, e.g. storing greyscale float32 images (with alpha even! you can store sparse depth maps without needing a separate mask!)It's like, uniquely suited to these sorts of 3D scene understanding challenges and I really hope people adopt the format for more scientific applications.",

That's 17ms longer on my M4 Pro. Apple hardware tends to be high-end, but this could still be significant. This isn't related to progressive rendering; the decoder is just slow. There's some suggestion that the Apple implementation is running on a single core, so maybe there's room for improvement.> JPEG XL support in Safari actually comes from the underlying OS rather than the browser. My guess is that Apple is considering using JPEG XL for iPhone photo storage rather than HEIC, and JPEG XL's inclusion in the browser is a bit of an afterthought. I'm just guessing though.> The implementation that was in Chromium behind a flag did support progressive rendering to some degree, but it didn't render anything until ~60 kB (39% of the file). The rendering is similar to the initial JPEG rendering above, but takes much more image data to get there. This is a weakness in the decoder rather than the format itself. I'll dive into what JPEG XL is capable of shortly.> I also tested the performance of the old behind-a-flag Chromium JPEG XL decoder, and it's over 500% slower (6x) to decode than AVIF. The old behind-a-flag Firefox JPEG XL decoder is about as slow as the Safari decoder. It's not fair to judge the performance of experimental unreleased things, but I was kinda hoping one of these would suggest that the Safari implementation was an outlier.> I thought that \"fast decoding\" was one of the selling points of JPEG XL over AVIF, but now I'm not so sure.> We have a Rust implementation of JPEG XL underway in Firefox, but performance needs to get a lot better before we can land it.\"[0]: https://jakearchibald.com/2025/present-and-future-of-progres...",

In this, it's a bridge between UX/product and users/stakeholders (technical stakeholders are admittedly too often an afterthought, but that's a process problem). If anyone comes in and attempts to blindly shove workshops at you without first conducting in-depth research, interviews, and field studies in your domain, then they are (without resorting to the One True Scotsman) not doing design thinking, they're doing cargo-cult brainstorming. (It's also a process orthogonal to agile development, since by definition it's a linear process that needs to be conducted prior to developing the actual product features and requirements.)The books and papers the OP cites are solid (Rittel and Webber, Buchanan, etc., though TRIZ, I think, is rather oversold), but in my experience the problem with most design thinking practitioners is that they aren't qualified sociologists and ethnographers, so a lot of design thinking is basically a reinvention of the last century of sociological middle-range theory and ethnographic principles, without being strongly informed by either, likely due to the field's foundation in early software requirements studies.",

I have been complaining about this years.Ok this will be a tangent, but I also take this one step farther and also talk about \"documentation\". Just for the record, I don't think documentation is all good or all bad, but it definitely can be used incorrectly and in excess. And Norman Doors and a great way to get this point across.When someone creates or installs a Norman Door by accident or out of ignorance and then realizes there is a problem, they often think \"I know, I will document it!\" and they add little placards to the door that says \"Push/Pull\" or some such. They see that this helps with a small subset of users and thinks \"there, I fixed the problem, people just need to read the documentation and now it is their problem if they don't\". But if you watch users of the door, a large portion will still use the door incorrectly because... people don't read documentation. If they don't read documentation, is it the users fault the door was designed incorrectly or was it the designers problem?I use this as an example for my developers on thinking before documenting troublesome code or a confusing interface to first ask \"can I design this so it is less confusing?\" and if so, that would usually be preferable to adding documentation \"to solve the problem\". Well designed code (or doors) with no documentation always beats poor designs with documentation.",

I know this has been a long-standing frustration — it's taken longer than any of us wanted.The good news: we shipped our differential renderer to everyone today. We rewrote our rendering system from scratch[1] and only ~1/3 of sessions see at least a flicker. Very, very few sessions see flickers in rapid succession which was so annoying before. Those numbers will keep dropping as people update.We've also been working upstream to add synchronized output / DEC mode 2026 support to environments where CC runs and have had patches accepted to VSCode's terminal[2]  and tmux[3]. Synchronized output totally eliminates flickering. As always, I recommend using Ghostty which has 2026 support and zero flicker.Happy to answer questions![1]: https://github.com/anthropics/claude-code/issues/769#issueco...[2]: https://github.com/xtermjs/xterm.js/pull/5453[3]: https://github.com/tmux/tmux/pull/4744",

Waymo in SF still employs a large number of highly paid engineers who are paid the money which used to move through SF via Uber/Lyft. And those SF engineers spend a decent chunk of it locally on food, art, entertainment, and various other services - so it has (somewhat) less of an effect on the city's overall economy/total employment.Waymo in Miami won't be locally re-spending nearly as much of Miami's money as Uber/Lyft did. Significantly more of it will be removed from Miami with each ride. This might be even more pronounced for cities like Houston, which don't attract tourism from Waymo staff.",

I preferred Waymo to the Uber/Lyft experience because it felt private. It was just me and my colleagues in the car, no strangers. It also felt futuristic and novel, which I'm sure will wear off. We experienced no weird or erratic driving, with one minor exception... Waymo always followed the speed limit. On a major road where the speed limit was 40mph, other cars were zipping around us at 55mph+. And, one parking lot had 5mph speed limit signs posted. As you can imagine, Waymo was the slowest vehicle in that parking lot by a wide margin.",

Rideshare has already added traffic according to some studies I've read.Basically, instead of someone going from point A (current location with own car nearby) to point B (destination), Point A becomes the destination of the previous passenger, and point B and C were the previous points A and B. So a single trip adds one more leg.It might reduce the need for parking... potentially. But there will still need to be a certain amount of time dedicated to charging for these cars that requires parking.If private car ownership continues increasing in cost, and households become increasingly cost burdened (transportation is already the second highest cost for households), then I wonder how this will impact demand for housing in areas dependent on cars.Curious on the outcomes here. I think the best thing we can do for city transportation is increasing the number of viable transportation options. Waymo is one option amongst the options dependent on roads, but walking, biking, and transit should still be a priority so that we maintain competition amongst transportation modes.",

Compare: Brussels-Athens 41mph avg, Stockholm-Paris 54mph avg, Amsterdam-Lisbon 47mph. The fastest EU route over that distance is probably Berlin-Madrid at 65mph, and the Amtrak is cheaper, has no changes, and is usually more comfortable than any of those.If you want (relatively) high speed, you can take the Brightline to Orlando, 236 mi in 3.5h aka 67 mph average. That's on par with Brussels-Amsterdam (68mph), Amsterdam-Paris (80mph), but indeed far below the marquee EU/Chinese/Japanese HSR routes of 150+ mph average speed.More generally: large parts of the eastern US had a developed railroad system (and often still do, for freight.)

      "content": "Hey HN, we trained and open-sourced a 1.5B model that predicts your next edits, similar to Cursor. You can download the weights here (https://huggingface.co/sweepai/sweep-next-edit-1.5b) or try it in our JetBrains plugin (https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/26860-sweep-ai-autocomp...).Next-edit autocomplete differs from standard autocomplete by using your recent edits as context when predicting completions. The model is small enough to run locally while outperforming models 4x its size on both speed and accuracy.We tested against Mercury (Inception), Zeta (Zed), and Instinct (Continue) across five benchmarks: next-edit above/below cursor, tab-to-jump for distant changes, standard FIM, and noisiness. We found exact-match accuracy correlates best with real usability because code is fairly precise and the solution space is small.Prompt format turned out to matter more than we expected. We ran a genetic algorithm over 30+ diff formats and found simple `original`/`updated` blocks beat unified diffs. The verbose format is just easier for smaller models to understand.Training was SFT on ~100k examples from permissively-licensed repos (4hrs on 8xH100), then RL for 2000 steps with tree-sitter parse checking and size regularization. The RL step fixes edge cases SFT can’t like, generating code that doesn’t parse or overly verbose outputs.We're open-sourcing the weights so the community can build fast, privacy-preserving autocomplete for any editor. If you're building for VSCode, Neovim, or something else, we'd love to see what you make with it!",

Also, if the boilerplate code is configuration, its good to see exactly what the configuration is when trying to grok how some code works.You bring up a good point with snippets though, and I wonder if that would be good information to feed into the LLM for autocomplete. That snippet is helpful if you want to write on condition at a time, but say you have a dozen conditions if statements to write with that snippet. After writing one, the LLM could generate a suggestion for the other 11 conditions using that same snippet, while also taking into consideration the different types of values and what you might be checking against.As for RAM/processing, you're not wrong there, but with specialized models, specialized hardware, and improvements in model design, the number of people working under such restricted environments where they are concerned about resource use will decrease over time, and the utility of these tools will increase.

          "content": "I find almost all modern content producers to be a depressing business, fundamentally incompatible with being a large corporation. This includes movies, TV and video games.The problem is the large corporation wants to remove creativity from the process. They want a repeatable formula that they can scale and infinitely reproduce.The wet dream for the modern AAA studio is a \"game\" like FIFA that has annual releases and loot boxes to gamble on to get better pixels. Call of Duty and similar games are the next best because it's user-generated content (\"UGC\"). They still have to invest to create maps, which they don't like doing. But you still have micro-transactions for skins so that's good (for them).I played Assassin's Creed Odyssey a lot. Some people don't like it because it's too CRPG. That's why I liked it. They paid a lot of attention to the environment. I've heard of teachers using it to portray ancient Greece.They managed this even though it was a little formulaic. I suspect that any future AC releases will be even more formulaic.The one exception to this \"large game studio = bad\" rule had been Rockstar. The various GTA3 titles and GTA4 were widely renowned because of their social commentary and wit, as well as being groundbreaking (at the time) for open world games.But GTA5 was a turning point for me. Yes it was a sprawling, beautiful environment but the writing was complete ass. It had none of the intelligence and insight of earlier titles. The characters were awful. But Rockstar seemingly didn't care because they're discovered the GTA Online money faucet, something I don't care about at all.I really wonder if GTA6 will be beautiful but soulless. It coudl go either way. RDR2 was released after GTA5, after all.These big studios really do have a habit of killing successful franchises or simply sucking the life out of them. There are few bigger fumbles than the EA SimCity fiasco. I guess you can say Civilization has maintained... something. But honestly I haven't really felt compelled to play the franchise much since Civ4.I do miss the days when games were games not just loot box slot machines with annual reskins.",

Ubisoft's now-cancelled Sands of Time project was described as a \"remake\" [1], which generally is a bigger project that keeps the same characters and story beats as the original, but revises the art and gameplay almost as if it were a sequel.I agree that remakes sound straightforward and it's baffling that Ubisoft couldn't get this one out the door: there are rumors that even before its announcement in 2020, the Sands of Time remake had been started, scrapped, and restarted. But even Nightdive Studios, a perennial remaster maker, struggled for many years with their System Shock remake [2] so it must be harder than it sounds.I'd love to hear the inside story from folks who've worked on remakes (both released and cancelled) about why they aren't as straightforward as fans expect. Nightdive recently discussed the emotional toll from dealing with angry fans [3] but I haven't seen any interviews discussing the development challenges.[1] https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Video_game_remake#Remaster\n[2] https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/System_Shock_(2023_video_game)\n[3] https://frvr.com/blog/system-shock-remake-lead-couldnt-sleep...",

We can monitor the wound and its secretions, can cover exposed tendons and bones without immediate doing microsurgical flaps.

While it was used as an interjection at times (just as it is today when someone exclaims, \"What?!\") in the context of the opening line of Beowulf \"hwæt\" is more likely being used to reformulate a statement in order to convey a sense of emphasis. An example in modern English would be something like, rather than saying \"That was a gorgeous sunset!\", one says \"What a gorgeous sunset that was!\". (Notice that the verb has now moved to the end of the sentence. In fact if you look at the last word of the line in question, we have the verb \"fremedon\" which means \"performed\", so indeed the placement of \"what\" at the beginning of the line facilitates the restructuring of the sentence in such a way that makes it \"sounds right\".)",

          "content": "It took me a few minutes to track down the original source of this. It is a paper by Dr George Walkden published in 2013 called \"The status of hwæt in Old English\" You can access the pdf from the link below [0].The abstract reads:>It is commonly held that Old English hwæt, well known within Anglo-Saxon studies as the first word of the epic poem Beowulf, can be ‘used as an adv[erb]. or interj[ection]. Why, what! ah!’ (Bosworth & Toller 1898, s.v. hwæt, 1) as well as the neuter singular of the interrogative pronoun hwa ̄ ‘what’. In this article I challenge the view that hwæt can have the status of an interjection (i.e. be outside the clause that it precedes). I present evidence from Old English and Old Saxon constituent order which suggests that hwæt is unlikely to be extra-clausal. Data is drawn from the Old English Bede, Ælfric’s Lives of Saints and the Old Saxon Heliand. In all three texts the verb appears later in clauses preceded by hwæt than is normal in root clauses (Fisher’s exact test, p < 0.0001 in both cases). If hwæt affects the constituent order of the clause it precedes, then it cannot be truly clause- external. I argue that it is hwæt combined with the clause that follows it that delivers the interpretive effect of exclamation, not hwæt alone. The structure of hwæt-clauses is sketched following Rett’s (2008) analysis of exclamatives. I conclude that Old English hwæt (as well as its Old Saxon cognate) was not an interjection but an underspecified wh-pronoun introducing an exclamative clause.[0] https://kops.uni-konstanz.de/server/api/core/bitstreams/413d...",

Old English speakers would have been more inclined to used interjections in a responsive context. For example, to the statement \"The boat is taking on water!\", one might respond \"How?!\".

The professor would typically give us (and himself) a 10-minute break in the middle of the class, and generally if you hung around the room, he'd strike up a more casual conversation in the room.This was also not long after Michael Jackson died. The conversation got onto him and his life and his mixed legacy of scandal, went on for a while, and somehow made its way to one student observing that (and I quote): \"he lived the American dream – he started out as a poor black boy and grew up to be a rich white man.\"The room sorta hung in uneasy suspense at how the professor would respond.\"...and SO IT IS that we see that the Mongol conquest...\", he said, launching noticeably-abruptly (and with a bit of a knowing grin) back into the course material.He was generally a good-natured dude like that. His voice sounded a little unusual, and I guess some students thought he sounded like Kermit the Frog. He came back into the room after a bathroom break once to find someone had drawn Kermit on the whiteboard behind where he usually stood when speaking. He saw it, stopped, visibly pondered what to do with it, and drew a speech bubble from Kermit saying something like \"the Silk Road\" (or whatever it was were about to cover; it's been quite a few years and I don't remember the specific topic).",

Walkden's interpretation actually makes more sense, when you see examples like \"Hwæt stendst þu her wælhreowa deor?\", meaning \"Why are you standing here, cruel beast?\"This may be a case where early translators over-indexed on e.g. Latin patterns and made a mistake which was then just accepted by subsequent translators.",

Even more so with things like \"Yo!\" or \"What ho!\" or \"Bro!\" or \"Lo!\". (Curious how all the options seem to end in -o.)This is more like \"So, the Spear-Danes ...\" where the initial \"So\" has roughly the same purpose of rhetorical throat-clearing and attention-getting, but now it's part of the sentence, as if it had been \"As it turns out, the Spear-Danes ...\" or \"You might have heard that the Spear-Danes ...\".I think the theory described in OP makes the function of \"hwaet\" a little different, though; not so much throat-clearing and attracting attention, as marking the sentence as exclamatory.

When I first got the Bambu in 2024 I did the whole Gridfinity thing. Very fun.As their post makes clear (even to me) there are actually a lot of things out there you can 3D print. Something I printed last year (and did not even bother to post) was a center-console \"compartment\" for a 1995 Mazda Miata I have. I swapped out the trashy aftermarket stereo (a previous owner has installed in the Miata) for one that is close to OEM but then I had an empty \"hole\" in the center console. So I printed a cubby for it.I too was like the author. Originally got into 3D printing years ago—found it frustrating. Picking up a Bambu printer a yearish ago made made all the difference in the world for me. Previously I had an Ender and it was, endlessly frustrating (pun intended). The Bambu is so next-level, the software so well integrated and polished, that I finally found that I enjoy, and I am not burdened by, 3D printing.(The only caveat about the Bambu is that people worry about vendor lock-in. I don't believe Bambu have enshittified that way yet, and people are finding workarounds in case they do, albeit by adding complexity in setting up, printing. The price of the Bambu for someone getting into 3D printing is very attractive.)[1] https://engineersneedart.com/blog/3dprinting2025/3dprinting2...",

For perhaps a year or so.If you have never designed physical objects before it is really challenging at first.  The learning curve is pretty steep and, at least in my case, I discovered that I didn't have a mental language for thinking about functional 3D and mechanical design.  You also start to look more closely at the objects around you and think about what went into designing them.I started doing 3D design about a decade ago, when I got my first 3D printer. At first using free modeling in CAD and then later learning how to do constraint based and parametric designs in Fusion 360.  This felt slow and perhaps limiting at first, but when you get used to it, it will save you a lot of time later and allow you to make more useful designs that are much easier to evolve and vary.I think it took something like 4-5 years before I printed something someone else had designed.  Mostly because I used 3D printing to make custom parts for my own projects, but also in an effort to force myself to learn.  I know the learning curve was steep, but for some reason I have forgotten how much work it was to learn.Now there are so many useful designs, designed by people who are a lot better than me available everywhere that I do print a lot of things others have designed.  But I think learning to design things yourself is a really good opportunity to learn useful skills.For instance, I had never anticipated that I, a software engineer, would get paid, by an actual customer, to design parts for their projects.  Or even consult on physical design for someone doing product development.  I am by no means at the level where I'd put it front and center on a resume, but I can design, and to some degree, manufacture simple mechanical parts.(Along with 3D printing I've been doing some CNC at a very hobbyist level.  I would still say I am very much a beginner when it comes to machining metals, but it is really fun to see that you can make reasonably precise metal parts for real applications (car parts) at home in my garage with not that much effort.

For comparison, the \"work exposure limit (WEL) for styrene is currently 100 parts per million (ppm) averaged over an 8-hour day\" [4].In other words, as long as you have some air exchange in the room, you'd be orders of magnitude away from the safe work exposure limit on styrene.It also makes sense, considering that it's a microscopic amount of molten plastic, whereas injection moulding factories work with vats of the stuff.[1]: https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S135223102...[2]: https://teesing.com/en/tools/ppm-mg3-converter[3]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Styrene[4]: https://www.hse.gov.uk/plastics/faqs.htm",

          "content": "I find this concern a little odd because most people tend to do very little in their life to make a difference in ways that count way more than a couple kilograms\nof PLA filament.Let’s take 1kg of filament, which is enough for multiple print projects depending on the size of the items.That is approximately the same weight of petrochemical material as 1/3 of a gallon of gas (making a bit of an assumption that the amount of processing per weight of both materials is roughly the same).Every time you drive 10 miles in a car that gets 30mpg it’s like you are burning an entire roll of filament.So the average American is using probably 1-4 rolls of filament just to get to work and back. The last time I bought a roll of filament was multiple months ago.I’m not singling you out, I am really just pointing out that humans are terrible at understanding the quantities of things and what things actually use a lot of material and create a lot of carbon emissions.This is especially true since cost is so detached from material use, waste, and carbon emissions.A gallon of gas is an order of magnitude cheaper than the equivalent weight of filament.Burning a bunch of BTUs of natural gas to make my house 4 degrees warmer and gain a trivial amount of additional comfort wastes a whole bunch of energy but costs me so little that I don’t even know what my gas bill is.It’s cheaper for me to replace most of my home appliances with brand new ones than hire a repair service.I can fly to Florida for $50 and burn 15 gallons of jet fuel.If I put more garbage out in my bin I’m not charged more. I can even put furniture and appliances out there and I am not charged more.These are all examples of waste and environmental impact where I don’t really see or feel the magnitude of them because our systems don’t show them.Anyway I know this is kind of a huge tangent of a discussion.

          "content": "Let me see if I can. Before we go to space, let's try something on the ground. Imagine pitching a ball horizontally. What do you expect if you pitch it too slow? The ball will curve more towards the ground and meet it early, won't it? (In other words, it doesn't go very far and doesn't stay airborne for long). Going from ground to space, this action remains the same. You need to 'lower an orbit'? Reduce its forward velocity. It will curve more towards the planet and reach closer to the ground.However, there is a bit more detail involved here. Why doesn't the satellite just fall to the Earth? (Please excuse me and disregard this part if you know this already. I'm trying to maintain conceptual continuity.) So, when something is flying horizontally (no aerodynamic forces), we know that its trajectory will curve towards the Earth due to the pull of gravity. If the ground (on Earth) curves as fast as, or even faster than the trajectory's curve, the object will never get an opportunity to even reach the ground. This is 'orbiting'.Now assume that the satellite is initially in a circular orbit. The gravitational force acting on the satellite at any point in the orbit is perpendicular to the satellite's velocity vector and tangential to the orbit. The satellite will maintain a constant speed at this point, since its velocity and the force are always perpendicular [1]. So, what happens when we reduce the satellite's forward velocity? Just as we've seen with the ball, the satellite's trajectory (orbit) starts to curve more towards Earth. Now a subtle, but important change occurs. The velocity and the gravitational pull are no longer perpendicular! They start to align! And when that happens, the speed MUST increase. So, the satellite is now losing altitude and speeding up simultaneously [2]. At some point, the satellite will pick up enough speed again to 'straighten its curve' and avoid falling to the ground. In effect, the satellite had to compensate for the lost velocity in order to remain in orbit, and it did so by exchanging some of its altitude (gravitational potential energy) for velocity (kinetic energy) [3].So our satellite 'fell' from where we slowed it down, until it had enough velocity again to maintain orbit. At that point, the gravity and the velocity are parallel again, since it will keep falling otherwise [4]. But since it 'fell from a higher altitude', it's speed is now too high for it to remain at that altitude. The orbital curvature is a bit 'too straight' now and it starts to curve away from Earth. So now we're in the exact opposite situation of what was explained in the last paragraph. The satellite is now climbing back up again! As it happens, the satellite actually climbs back up to the point where we slowed it down! And when at that point, its velocity is exactly the same as what it was, after we had slowed it down! [5] So the satellite did the inverse of what it did earlier - it exchanged kinetic energy to get back its altitude (potential energy). The satellite is now living in cycles juggling kinetic energy and potential energy back and forth. The final effect is that the point in orbit that's diametrically opposite to where you slowed it down, is now at a lower altitude. And thus you've effectively 'reduced the orbit'!One more detail to pin down. How do we slow down a satellite in the first place? Easy! Push the satellite in the opposite direction of its velocity [6]. This is called 'retrograde thrusting' or 'retro burn'. But that's about as easy as it gets. Remember that unlike on Earth, you don't have a surface (a wall or the ground) to lean against. Imagine pushing something heavy on an ice rink. The good news is that you can still push things on an ice rink. The only catch is that the push force will set both the item and you in motion in opposite directions [7]. And that's exactly what we do in space. We throw out mass from the satellite in the form of super-fast gaseous of plasma exhaust. The key is to throw out the mass with as much momentum as possible. But the mass is limited by how much you can carry - it's a depleting resource. So you're basically left figuring out how to throw it out with ever increasing speeds. And that's how we slow down the satellite in space - fire your thrusters!And finally to lower an orbit entirely, instead of just one point on it, you have to do multiple firings. There are bunch of these 'orbital maneuvers'. The most common one is the Hohmann Transfer [8]. If you could understand what's given above, most orbital maneuvers including Hohmann Transfer will feel very intuitive to you.[1] Speed is the magnitude of velocity and it remains steady in a circular orbit. However, the perpendicular force will keep bending the velocity vector, thus constantly changing its direction.[2] This is the from-the-first-principles explanation of conservation of angular momentum. This is how the ballerina spins faster by pulling in her arms.[3] If this sounds like a 'negative feedback' phenomenon to you, that's because it is. Feedback is a mathematical construct. Nobody ever said that a feedback mechanism must be implemented separately. Some systems have them inherently built-in.[4] This is the lowest point of the orbit - the periapsis.[5] Yes. There is quite a bit of hand waving here. I didn't explain why the satellite went back to its original position with the exact same speed. But that's what actually happens. It might take a lot more 'mathematical sense' to explain just using words. One thing I know is that this has something to do with the fact that the gravitational field is one of those 'conservative fields'. If you take a trip inside a conservative field, and return to the location where you started, you will be left with the exact same (kinetic) energy as you started with. You may exchange your energy during the trip, but you always regain it back when you get back to the starting point, no matter what path you took. As far as I understand, the 'conservative' part refers to the part that the energy is conserved and stored, and never lost. Unfortunately, the force field that we're most familiar with - frictional force - isn't conservative at all. If you're going on a trip, be ready to spend some energy![6] One matter that confuses a lot of people is why the satellite's position changed at the opposite side of the orbit, instead of the point where we applied the force. The answer is in the Newton's second law. Force changes momentum, not position - at least not directly. The direct effect of application of retro thrust is that the velocity reduces at that point. The change of position on the other side of the orbit is only a consequence of that velocity change.[7] Yes, the Newton's vengeance law.[8] https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hohmann_transfer_orbit[9] Every so often, someone comes along and argues that gravity is not a real force and all these explanations are wrong. If you want to deal with this in terms of relativity and space time curvature, be my guest. But for all practical purposes, the old faithful Newtonian physics works just fine, even as a special case of relativity.[10] This should probably have been a blog post. Please don't shout at me if it annoys you. This is one of my favorite subjects and I just got carried away. I used to teach and train many students and junior professionals in these topics.",

You could set an email to be sent as a result of another email.IT were not stupid though, and set a series of rules:1. You cannot have a rule trigger to email yourself.2. You cannot reply to an email triggered by a rule.3. You have ~50MB max of emails (which was a lot at the time).Playing around one lunch, my friend had setup a \"not in office\" automated reply, I setup a rule to reply to any emails within our domain with a \"not in office\", but put their name in TO, CC and BCC. It turns out that this caused rule #2 not to trigger. After setting up the same rule on my friend's email, and sending a single email, the emails fired approximately one every 30 seconds.A few hours later we returned to our email boxes to realise that there were thousands and thousands of emails. At some point we triggered rule #3, which in turn sent an email \"out of space\", with a small embedded school logo. Each one of these emails triggered our email rule, which in turn triggered an email \"could not send message\", again with an embedded logo. We desperately tried to delete all of the emails, but it just made way for more emails. We eventually had to abandon our efforts to delete the emails, and went to class.About an hour later, the email server failed. Several hours later all domain logins failed. It turned out that logins were also run on the email server.The events were then (from what I was told by IT):* Students could not save their work to their network directory.* New students could not login.* Teachers could not login to take registers or use the SMART white boards.* IT try to login to the server, failure.* IT try to reboot the server, failure.* IT take the server apart and attempt to mount the disk - for whatever reason, also failure.* IT rebuild the entire server software.* IT try to restore data from a previous backup, failure. Apparently the backup did not complete.* IT are forced to recover from a working backup from two weeks previous.All from one little email rule. I was banned from using all computers for 6 months. When I finally did get access, there was a screen in the IT office that would show my display at all times when logged in. Sometimes IT would wiggle my mouse to remind me that they were there, and sometimes I would open up Notepad and chat to them.P.S. Something happened on the IT system a year later, and they saw I was logged in. They ran to my class, burst through the door, screamed by username and dragged me away from the keyboard. My teacher was in quite some shock, and then even more shocked to learn that I had caused the outage about a year earlier.",

The language server can be a more complicated program and so could surface particularly detailed information about the syntax; it might also be slower than tree-sitter.We (TypeScript) used to do this for Visual Studio prior to tmLanguage. It was nice because we didn't have to write a second parser. Our parser was already error-tolerant and incremental, and syntax highlighting just involved descending into the syntax tree's tokens. So there was no room for divergence bugs in parsers, and there was also no need to figure out how to encode oddities and ambiguity-breaking logic in limited formats like tmLanguage.This all predated TSServer (which predated LSP, though that's coming in TypeScript 7). The latency for syntax highlighting over JSON was too much, and other editors often didn't make syntax highlighting available outside of tmLanguage anyway. Eventually semantic highlighting became a thing, which is more latency-tolerant, and overlays colors on top of a syntactic highlighter in VS Code.The other issue with this approach was that we still needed a dedicated thread just for fast syntax highlighting. That thread was a separate instance of the JS language service without anything shared, so that was a decent amount of memory overhead just for syntax highlighting.",

For example, suppose you have two versions of a pop function, one imported from a stack library, and another from a heap library. If you use a tool like the dumb-jump package in Emacs and you use it to jump to the definition for a call to pop, it might get confused as to where to go because it’s not sure what module is in scope at the point. A language server, on the other hand, should have access to this information and would not get confused.You are correct that a language server will generally provide correct navigation/autocomplete,\nbut a language server doesn’t necessarily need to hook into an existing compiler: a language server might be a latency-sensitive re-implementation of an existing compiler toolchain (rust-analyzer is the one I’m most familiar with, but the recent crop of new language servers tend to take this direction if the language’s compiler isn’t query-oriented).> It is possible to use the language server for syntax highlighting. I am not aware of any particularly strong reasons why one would want to (or not want to) do this.Since I spend a lot of time writing Rust, I’ll use Rust as an example: you can highlight a binding if it’s mutable or style an enum/struct differently.

Tree-sitter parses on the main thread (or a close worker) typically in sub-ms timeframes, ensuring that syntax coloring is synchronous with keystrokes. LSP semantic tokens are asynchronous by design. If you rely solely on LSP for highlighting, you introduce a flash of unstyled content or color-shifting artifacts every time you type, because the round-trip to the server (even a local one) and the subsequent re-tokenization takes longer than the frame budget.The ideal hygiene could be something like -> tree-sitter provides the high-speed lexical coloring (keywords, punctuation, basic structure) instantly and LSP paints the semantic modifiers (interfaces vs classes, mutable vs const) asynchronously like 200ms later.

In this case, treesitter has to guess, and it might guess wrong.As for what can you do with an AST and what can't you: you can tell if something is a function call, a variable reference, or any other piece of syntax, but if you write something like x = 2; then tree-sitter has no idea what x is, is it a float, an int? is it a local, a class variable, or a global?

          "content": "C# Language Designer here, and one of the designers/architects of 'Roslyn', the semantic analysis engine that powers the C#/VB compilers, VS IDE experiences, and our LSP server.The original post conflates some concepts worth separating. LSP and language servers operate at an IDE/Editor feature level, whereas tree-sitter is a particular technological choice for parsing text and producing a syntax tree. They serve different purposes but can work together.What does a language server actually do? LSP defines features like:  1. Finding references (`textDocument/references`)\n\n  2. Go-to-definition (`textDocument/definition`)\n\n  3. Syntax highlighting (`textDocument/semanticTokens/...`)\n\n  4. Code completion, diagnostics, refactorings\n\nA language server for language X could use tree-sitter internally to implement these features. But it can use whatever technologies it wants. LSP is protocol-level; tree-sitter is an implementation detail.The article talks about tree-sitter avoiding the problem of \"maintaining two parsers\" (one for the compiler, one for the editor). This misunderstands how production compiler/IDE systems actually work. In Roslyn, we don't have two parsers. We have one parser that powers both the compiler and the IDE. Same code, same behavior, same error recovery. This works better, not worse. You want your IDE to understand code exactly the way the compiler does, not approximately.The article highlights tree-sitter being \"error-tolerant\" and \"incremental\" as key advantages. These are real concerns. If you're starting from scratch with no existing language infrastructure, tree-sitter's error tolerance is valuable. But this isn't unique to tree-sitter. Production compiler parsers are already extremely error-tolerant because they have to be. People are typing invalid code 99% of the time in an editor.Roslyn was designed from day one for IDE scenarios. We do incremental parsing (https://github.com/dotnet/roslyn/blob/main/docs/compilers/De...), but more importantly, we do incremental semantic analysis. When you change a file, we recompute semantic information for just the parts that changed, not the entire project. Tree-sitter gives you incremental parsing. That's good. But if you want rich IDE features, you need incremental semantics too.The article suggests language servers are inherently \"heavy\" while tree-sitter is \"lightweight.\" This isn't quite right. An LSP server is as heavy or light as you make it. If all you need is parsing and there's no existing language library, fine, use tree-sitter and build a minimal LSP server on top. But if you want to do more, LSP is designed for that. The protocol supports everything from basic syntax highlighting to complex refactorings.Now, as to syntax highlighting.  Despite the name, it isn't just syntactic in modern IDEs. In C#, we call this \"classification,\" and it's powered by the full semantic model. A reference to a symbol is classified by what that symbol is: local, parameter, field, property, class, struct, type parameter, method, etc. Symbol attributes affect presentation. Static members are italicized, unused variables are faded, overwritten values are underlined. We classify based on runtime behavior: `async` methods, `const` fields, extension methods.This requires deep semantic understanding. Binding symbols, resolving types, understanding scope and lifetime. Tree-sitter gives you a parse tree. That's it. It's excellent at what it does, but it's fundamentally a syntactic tool.Example: in C#, `var x = GetValue();` is syntactically ambiguous. Is `var` a keyword or a type name? Only semantic analysis can tell you definitively. Tree-sitter would have to guess or mark it generically.Tree-sitter is definitely a great technology though. Want to add basic syntax highlighting for a new language to your editor? Tree-sitter makes this trivial. Need structural editing or code folding? Perfect use case. However, for rich IDE experiences, the kind where clicking on a variable highlights all its uses, or where hovering shows documentation, or where renaming a method updates all call sites across your codebase, you need semantic analysis. That's a fundamentally different problem than parsing.Tree-sitter definitely lowers the barrier to supporting new languages in editors. But it's not a replacement for language servers or semantic analysis engines. They're complementary technologies. For languages with mature compilers and semantic engines (C#, TypeScript, Rust, etc.), using the real compiler infrastructure for IDE features makes sense. For cases with simpler tooling needs, tree-sitter is an excellent foundation to build on.",

This parser needs to be error-tolerant because it needs to return usable ASTs despite often parsing incomplete, incorrect code and fast enough to run on every keystroke so it can provide realtime feedback.Most of the time they rely on their own hand-rolled recursive descent parser. Writing these isn't necessarily hard but time-consuming and tedious especially if you're parsing a large language like C++.Parser generators like yacc, bison, chumsky, ANTLR etc. can generate a parser for you given a grammar. However these parsers usually don't have the best performance or error reporting characteristics because they are auto-generated. A recursive descent parser is usually faster and because you can customize syntax error messages, easier for an LSP to use to provide good diagnostics.Tree-sitter is also a parser generator but has better error tolerance properties (not quite as good as hand-written but generally better than prior implementations). Additionally, its incremental meaning it can reuse prior parses to more efficiently create a new AST. Most hand-written parsers are not incremental but are usually still fast enough to be usable in LSPs.To use tree-sitter you define a grammar in JavaScript that tree-sitter will use to generate a parser in C which you can then use a dynamic or static library in your application.In your case, this is useful because you can compile down those C libraries to WASM which can run right in the browser and will usually be faster than pure JS (the one catch is serialization overhead between JS and WASM).

          "content": "> Hmm, the strong reason could be latency and layout stability. Tree-sitter parses on the main thread (or a close worker) typically in sub-ms timeframesOne of the designers/architects of 'Roslyn' here, the semantic analysis engine that powers the C#/VB compilers, VS IDE experiences, and our LSP server.Note: For roslyn, we aim for microsecond (not millisecond) parsing.  Even for very large files, even if the initial parse is milliseconds, we have an incremental parser design (https://github.com/dotnet/roslyn/blob/main/docs/compilers/De...) that makes 99.99+% of edits happen in microseconds, while reusing 99.99+ of syntax nodes, while also producing an independent, immutable tree (thus ensuring no threading concerns sharing these trees out to concurrent consumers).> you introduce a flash of unstyled content or color-shifting artifacts every time you type, because the round-trip to the server (even a local one) and the subsequent re-tokenization takes longer than the frame budget.This would indicate a serious problem somewhere.It's also no different than any sort of modern UI stack.  A modern UI stack would never want external code coming in that could ever block it.  So all, potentially unbounded, processing work will be happening off the UI thread, ensuring that that thread is always responsive.Note that \"because the round-trip to the server (even a local one)\" is no different from round-tripping to a processing thread.  Indeed, in Visual Studio that is how it works as we have no need to run our server in a separate process space.  Instead, the LSP server itself for roslyn simply runs in-process in VS as a normal library.  No different than any other component that might have previously been doing this work.> Relying on LSP for the base layer makes the editor feel sluggish.It really should not.  Note: this does take some amount of smart work.  For example, in roslyn's classification systems we have a cascading set of classifying threads.  One that classifies lexically, one for syntax, one for semantics, and finally, one for embedded languages (imagine embedded regex/json, or even C# nested in c#).  And, of course, these embedded languages have cascading classification as well :DNote that this concept is used in other places in LSP as well.  For example, our diagnostics server computes compiler-syntax, vs compiler-semantics, versus 3rd-party analyzers, separately.The approach of all of this has several benefits.  First, we can scale up with the capabilities of the machine.  So if there are free cores, we can put them to work computing less relevant data concurrently.  Second, as results are computed on some operation, it can be displayed to the user without having to wait for the rest to finish.  Being fine-grained means the UI can appear crisp and responsive, while potentially slower operations take longer but eventually appear.For example, compiler syntax diagnostics generally take microseconds.  While 3rd-party analyzer diagnostics might take seconds.  No point in stalling the former while waiting for the latter to run.  LSP makes multi-plexing this stuff easy",

      "abstract": "该讨论围绕“让Claude玩文字冒险游戏”展开，核心话题是探索大型语言模型在交互式文本游戏中的表现与应用潜力。社区普遍认为Claude在解谜和叙事理解上表现不错，例如有用户指出它能通过细致观察解开谜题，甚至尝试创造性地使用道具（如用鱼油润滑锁具）。\n\n讨论中出现了不同观点：有人认为训练数据中已包含游戏实录，模型可能从中学习；也有用户分享了自己让Claude解析游戏书或适配Z-Machine框架的实验，展示了技术拓展的可能性。争议点集中在效率与实用性上——有用户讽刺此举消耗算力资源“像用森林焚烧玩DDoS游戏”，而支持者则视其为研究记忆架构或增强游戏交互的契机。\n\n共识在于，当前模型在自主记忆管理上存在局限，例如容易重复探索死路。因此社区提议引入笔记系统或任务追踪机制来优化表现，体现了对技术改进方向的共同关注。",

I was pretty surprised by this, as I expected they'd be able to traverse more or less optimally most of the time.I tried basic raw long-context chat, various approaches of getting it to externalize the state (i.e. prompting it to emit the known state of the maze after each move, but not telling it exactly what to emit or how to format it), and even allowing it to emit code to execute after each turn (so long as it was a serialization/storage algorithm, not a solver in itself), but it invariably would get lost at some point. (It always neglected to emit a key for which coordinate was which, and which direction was increasing. Even if I explicitly told it to do this, it would frequently forget to at some point anyway and get turned around again. If I explicitly provided the key each move, it would usually work).Of course it had no problem writing an optimal algorithm to solve mazes when prompted. In fact it basically wrote itself; I have no idea how to write a maze generator. I thought the disparity was interesting.Note the mazes had the start and end positions inside the maze itself, so they weren't trivially solvable by the \"follow wall to the left\" algorithm.This was last summer so maybe newer models would do better. I also stopped due to cost.",

          "content": "Now would this be useful in high scaling games, specifically: determining if you might be a winner of game with a grid of 10^nx10^n (where n>5). A very large \"cow bingo game\", where the insertions are made randomly spawned on a grid? Seems one of the other filters would be more appropriate as they support dynamic insertion.Still very neat, nice work!",

          "content_cn": "那么这种方法在大型游戏中是否有用呢？具体来说：能否用于判断你是否可能赢得一个规模为10^n×10^n（其中n>5）的网格游戏？这就像一个超大型的“奶牛宾果游戏”，其中插入操作是在网格上随机生成的。似乎其他过滤器会更合适，因为它们支持动态插入。不过这个方法仍然非常巧妙，做得好！"

          "content": "One construction is smaller and faster to build than xor filters, and another is even more compact, though slower:> we build probabilistic filters -- called binary fuse filters -- that are within 13% of the storage lower bound -- without sacrificing query speed. As an additional benefit, the construction of the new binary fuse filters can be more than twice as fast as the construction of xor filters. By slightly sacrificing query speed, we further reduce storage to within 8% of the lower bound.",
