      "abstract": "该讨论围绕“太空数据中心是否可行”展开，多数用户认为这一想法缺乏实际意义。核心争议点集中在冷却、成本与延迟问题上。有用户指出，太空是真空环境，散热只能依赖辐射，效率极低，且需要巨大散热器，而将设备送入太空的成本极高。也有用户提到，即使不考虑冷却，数据中心的轨道运行会导致网络延迟大幅波动，不适合对延迟敏感的应用。讨论中部分人认为，该想法可能源于科幻作品的启发，而非实际工程考量。尽管有用户提出在月球建立数据中心或利用太空能源等设想，但普遍共识是，当前技术下太空数据中心在成本、散热和实用性方面均不具可行性。",

A satellite is, if nothing else, a fantastic thermos.  A data center in space would necessarily rely completely on cooling by radiation, unlike a terrestrial data center that can make use of convection and conduction. You can't just pipe heat out into the atmosphere or build a heat exchanger. You can't exchange heat with vacuum.  You can only radiate heat into it.Heat is going to limit the compute that can be done in a satellite data centre and radiative cooling solutions are going to massively increase weight. It makes far more sense to build data centers in the arctic.Musk is up to something here.  This could be another hyperloop (i.e. A distracting promise meant to sabotage competition).  It could be a legal dodge.  It could be a power grab.  What it will not be is a useful source of computing power.  Anyone who takes this venture seriously is probably going to be burned.",

Getting things to space is incredibly expensive2. Ingress/egress are almost always a major bottleneck - how is bandwidth cheaper in space?3. Chips must be “Rad-hard” - that is do more error correcting from ionizing radiation - there were entire teams at NASA dedicated to special hardware for this.4. Gravity and atmospheric pressure actually do wonders for easy cooling. Heat is not dissipated in space like we are all used to and you must burn additional energy trying to move the heat generated away from source.5. Energy production will be cheaper from earth due to mass manufacturing of necessary components in energy systems - space energy systems need novel technology where economies of scale are lost.Would love for someone to make the case for why it actually makes total sense, because it’s really hard to see for me!",

This means if you are not careful with the surface of a satellite it can end up being very slowly cooked by sunlight alone not including running any higher heat producing component (as it absorbs more heat from sunlight then it emits, there is a reason satellites are mostly white, silver or reflective gold in color). Sure better surface materials fix that, but not to a point where you would want to run any heavy compute on it.3. zero repair-ability, most long running satellites have a lot of redundancy. Also at least if you are bulk buying Nvidea GPGPUs on single digit Million Euro basis it's not rare that 30% have some level of defect. Not necessary \"fully broken\" but \"performs less good then it should/compared to other units\" kind of broken.4. radiation/solar wind protections are a huge problem. Heck even if you run things on earth it's a problem as long as your operations scale is large enough. In space things are magnitudes worse.5. every rocket lunch causes atmospheric damage, so does every satellite evaporating on re-entry.

A Starlink-sized satellite should be able to hold 40 or so chips. There's no reason why a larger satellitte couldn't hold, say, 1024.\n* They mention training, but sampling is what makes sense here.

That's ~150-200 W/sqm.That means, per GPU, you'd need about 2.5-3.0 sqm of passive radiators.For a 1MW satellite (~8 datacenter racks of GB200/NVL72) you'd need basically half a football field of bleeding-edge solar panels (that also need to radiate their heat on the reverse side) and a similar sized cooling array of heat radiators for the electronics.This is on the scale of 40-50 tons - about 10% of the IIS.  This should fit on falcon heavy or starship - assuming the solar array and radiators can fold up to fit inside.  You could, purely based on weight, launch 2 of these per starship launch.If you consider the Opex savings (electricity, rent, facilities maintenance) and putting 2 of these on a single starship launch, I still think the ROI would be too long.  You're saving about ~$1M per year in Opex but it's costing you $25M to launch it into space and likely an extra ~$50M in satellite equipment (based on starlink satellite costs) on top of the compute.  Will those GPUs still be useful in 10 years? Probably not.I don't think the math is there that justifies the free electricity - even at gigawatt scale (thousands of satellites mass-produced) and at a dramatically lower cost per satellite and per launch.  Getting costs down on this would involve tightly integrating the compute and the satellite hardware which would make upgrading the compute independently from the cooling/power infrastructure in the future a significant challenge.",

Most of advertised savings come not from placing the data centre in space, but the fact that advocates have argued away the need for absolutely everything that modern data centres are designed to supply, except for the compute.If they can really build a space data centre satellite for as cheap as they claim, why launch it? Just drive it out into the middle of the desert and dump it there. It can access the internet via starlink, and already has solar panels for power and radiators for cooling. IMO, If it can cool itself in direct sunlight in space, it can cool itself in the desert.The main thing that space gains you over setting up the same satellite in the desert is ~23 hours of power, vs the ~12 hours of power on the ground. And you suddenly gain the ability to repair the satellite. The cost of the launch would have to be extremely cheap before the extra 11ish hours of runtime per day outweighed the cost of a launch; Just build twice as many \"ground satellites\".And that's with a space optimised design. We can gain even more cost savings by designing proper distributed datacenter elements. You don't need lightweight materials, just use steel. You can get rid of the large radiators and become more reliant on air cooling. You can built each element bigger, because you don't have to fit the rocket dimensions. You could even add a wind turbine, so your daily runtime isn't dependant on daylight hours. Might even be worth getting rid of solar and optimising for wind power instead.An actual ground optimised design should be able to deliver the same functionality as the space data centre, for much cheaper costs. And it's this ground optimised distributed design that space data centres should be compared to, not today's datacenter which are hyper-optimised for pre-AI use cases.-------------------Space data centres are nothing more than a cool Sci-Fi solution looking for a problem. There have been mumblings for years, but they were never viable (even bitcoin mining was a bit too latency sensitive). Space data centre advocates have been handed a massive win with this recent AI boom, it's the perfect problem for their favourite solution to solve.But because it's a solution looking for a problem, they are completely blind to other solutions that might be an even better fit.",

Shielding provided by the atmosphere would have to be replaced.You also underestimate the cooling problem. The fact that space is cold doesn’t mean it’s easy to cool things off in space. On earth the main cooling strategy is to transfer heat through direct contact and move the hot stuff away. Be it air or water, as you mentioned. In space your only option is to radiate heat away. And that’s while half of you is under intense sunlight.I think you also undersell the thread of warfare in space. Sure, a guy with Molotov can’t get you space data center but we’ve had satellite shot down. So maybe not every war is a threat but, say China or Russia (or other space-faring nation) could take care of a satellite if absolutely needed.National seizures are also still a threat. If only being outside national borders was such a great defense we’d see some data centers in the sea by now.So being in space is immune to some of the known problems but also comes with a whole lot of novel issues, not solved at scale yet.

To achieve this, Starcloud is developing a lightweight deployable radiator design with a very large area - by far the largest radiators deployed in space - radiating primarily towards deep space...They claim they can radiate \"633.08 W / m^2\". At that rate, they're looking at square kilometers of radiators to dissipate gigawatts of thermal load, perhaps hectares of radiators.They also claim that they can \"dramatically increase\" heat dissipation with heat pumps.So, there you have it: \"all you have to do\" is deploy a few hectares of radiators in space, combined with heat pumps that can dissipate gigawatts of thermal load with no maintenance at all over a lifetime of decades.This seems like the sort of \"not technically impossible\" problem that can attract a large amount of VC funding, as VCs buy lottery tickets that the problem can be solved.",

          "content": "I don't know if data centers in space make sense or not, but I'm really not liking these comments that say something is \"too expensive\" or \"too hard\" without actually crunching the numbers to verify if it actually is. It's like you point out a number of completely obvious problems with the scheme and immediately, without any detailed analysis or expertise (I know this, because surely you can't have expertise in all of the problems you cited) in the said problems, claim that they are completely impossible for anyone to ever solve.> 1. every gram you need to send to space is costly, a issue you don't have at ground levelThis is a one time cost. Maybe the running costs are cheap enough to offset this.> 2. cooling is a catastrophe, sure space is cold, but also a vacuum, so the cooling rate is roughly the infrared radiation rate. This means if you are not careful with the surface of a satellite it can end up being very slowly cooked by sunlight alone not including running any higher heat producing component (as it absorbs more heat from sunlight then it emits, there is a reason satellites are mostly white, silver or reflective gold in color). Sure better surface materials fix that, but not to a point where you would want to run any heavy compute on it.I would assume the people designing this are \"very careful\" with everything they put in the data center. If achieving the cooling is only very hard and requires careful material engineering, then it can be worked out and they will get it done. If it is impossible, then this will not happen, but I'm a physicist myself and I can't tell without a very involved analysis whether it is impossible or not to get enough cooling power for this in space, considering all, possibly ingenious ways to engineer the surfaces of the data center to dissipate a maximum amount of heat.> 3. zero repair-ability, most long running satellites have a lot of redundancy. Also at least if you are bulk buying Nvidea GPGPUs on single digit Million Euro basis it's not rare that 30% have some level of defect. Not necessary \"fully broken\" but \"performs less good then it should/compared to other units\" kind of broken.I suppose they could make something like the International Space Station, which would get regular traffic back-and-forth exchanging and servicing hardware as needed.> 4. radiation/solar wind protections are a huge problem. Heck even if you run things on earth it's a problem as long as your operations scale is large enough. In space things are magnitudes worse.Again, it's not a question whether this is \"problematic\"; everything about putting data centers in space is. The question is whether, with huge amount of work and resources, they can engineer a solution to overcome this. If they can, it's again a one time cost for the data center that might be offset by the running costs of the facility.> 5. every rocket lunch causes atmospheric damage, so does every satellite evaporating on re-entry. That wasn't that relevant in the past, but might become a problem just for keeping stuff like Starlink running. We don't need to make it worse by putting datacenters into space.> 6. Kessler Syndrom is real and could seriously hurt humanity as a whole, no reason to make it much more likely by putting things into space which don't need to go there.These are collective problems for the whole of humanity and will not concern an individual actor such as Elon Musk who wants to send more satellites into space.",

They all boil down to needing a lot of mass to radiate heat out to the universe and ways to conduct heat. We've been doing that at small scale for decades. SpaceX is already operating a fleet of many thousands of satellites that they built and engineered. They'd be well familiar with this challenge.Once you have solutions, it turns into a cost problem. And if that cost is too high (for whatever arbitrary threshold you use for that) it becomes an optimization problem.This whole thread reads like a lot of \"but ... but ... but ...\". It all boils down to people assuming things about what is too much or too hard. And it's all meaningless unless you actually bother to articulate those assumptions. What exactly is too hard here? What would it take to address those issues? What would the cost be? Put some numbers on it. There are also all sorts of assumptions about what is valuable and what isn't. You can't say something is too hard or too costly without making assertions about what is worth paying for and what isn't.The answers are going to be boring. We need X amounts of giga tons launched to orbit at Y amount of dollars. OK great. What happens if launch cost drops by 1 or 2 orders of magnitude? What happens if the amount of mass needed drops because of some engineering innovation? Massively dropping launch cost is roughly what SpaceX is proposing to do with Star Ship. Is it still \"too hard\"? You can't have that debate until you put numbers on your assertions.There's a bit of back of the envelope math involved here but we're roughly talking about a million satellites. In the order of ~2.5 million tonnes of mass (at 2.5 ton per satellite). Tens of thousands of Star Ship launches basically. It's definitely a big project. We're talking about 1-2 order magnitude increase of the scale of operations for SpaceX going from lower hundreds to thousands of launches per year spread over maybe 10-15 years to work up to a million satellites.I'm more worried about what all that mass is going to do when it burns up in the atmosphere / drops in the oceans.

Reducing the cost of launches is great, but it will never be as cheap as zero launches.2.

Radiation events don't only cause unpredictable data errors, they can also cause circuit latch-ups and cascade into system failure. Error-free operation is still better in any case.

On Earth you can use conduction, convection, AND radiation for cooling. Space only gets you marginally more effective radiation.5. Solar is cheaper on the ground than in space. The increase in solar collection capability per unit area in space doesn't offset the cost of launch: you can get 20kW of terrestrial solar collection for around the price of a single 1U satellite launch, and that solar production can be used on upgraded equipment in the future.

That's why tools like shred and SDelete rename files before destroying them. But even then, when those tools rename and destroy files, it stands out, it might even be worse because investigators can speculate more. It might corroborate some other piece of evidence (e.g.: sdelete's prefetch entry on windows, or download history from a browser for the same tool), and that might be a more serious charge (obstruction of justice in the US).",

There are statutory instruments (in France, constitutional clauses), that determine the independence of these authorities.They are tasked - and held to account by respective legislative bodies - with implementing the law as written.Nobody wrote a law saying \"Go after Grok\". There is however a law in most countries about the creation and dissemination of CSAM material and non-consensual pornography. Some of that law is relatively new (the UK only introduced some of these laws in recent years), but they all predate the current wave of AI investment.Founders, boards of directors and their internal and external advisors could:1. Read the law and make sure any tools they build comply2. When told their tools don't comply take immediate and decisive action to change the tools3. Work with law enforcement to apply the law as writtenThose companies, if they find this too burdensome, have the choice of not operating in that market. By operating in that market, they both implicitly agree to the law, and are required to explicitly abide by it.They can't then complain that the law is unfair (it's not), that it's being politicised (How? By whom? Show your working), and that this is all impossible in their home market where they are literally offering presents to the personal enrichment of the President on bended knee while he demands that ownership structures of foreign social media companies like TikTok are changed to meet the agenda of himself and his administration.So, would the EU like more tighter speech controls? Yes, they'd like implementation of the controls on free speech enshrined in legislation created by democratically appointed representatives. The alternative - algorithms that create abusive content, of women and children in particular - are not wanted by the people of the UK, the EU, or most of the rest of the World, laws are written to that effect, and are then enforced by the authorities tasked with that enforcement.This isn't \"anti-democratic\", it's literally democracy in action standing up to technocratic feudalism that is an Ayn Randian-wet dream being played out by some morons who got lucky.",

That this isn't just on the user's computer but instead posted on X.For 1. it seems to breakdown if we look more broadly at how LLMs are used. e.g. as a coding agent. We're basically starting to treat LLMs as a higher level framework now. We don't hold vendors of programming languages or frameworks responsible if someone uses them to create CSAM. Yes LLM generated the content, but the user still provided the instructions to do so.For 2. if Grok instead generated the content for download would the liability go away? What if Grok generated the content to be downloaded only and then the user uploaded manually to X? If in this case Grok isn't liable then why does the automatic posting (from the user's instructions) make it different? If it is, then it's not about the distribution anymore.There are some comparisons to photoshop, that if i created a deep fake with photoshop that I'm liable not Adobe.

While sexual imagery of real minors is highly illegal everywhere, there's a whole lot of other material – textual stories, drawings, animation, AI-generated images of nonexistent minors – which can be extremely criminal on one side of an international border, de facto legal on the other.And I'm not actually sure what the legal definition is in France; the relevant article of the French Penal Code 227-23 [0] seems superficially similar to the legal definition of \"child pornography\" in the United States (post-Ashcroft vs Free Speech Coalition), and so some–but (maybe) not all–of the \"CSAM\" Grok is accused of generating wouldn't actually fall under it. (But of course, I don't know how French courts interpret it, so maybe what it means in practice is something broader than my reading of the text suggests.)And I think this is part of the issue – xAI's executives are likely focused on compliance with US law on these topics, less concerned with complying with non-US law, in spite of the fact that CSAM laws in much of the rest of the world are much broader than in the US. That's less of an issue for Anthropic/Google/OpenAI, since their executives don't have the same \"anything that's legal\" attitude which xAI often has.

It is this process, and your intimacy with the medium and the materials you’re shaping, that teaches you about what you’re making – its qualities, tolerances, and limits – even as you make it. You know the least about what you’re making the moment before you actually start making it. That’s when you think you know what you want to make. The process, which is an iterative one, is what leads you towards understanding what you actually want to make, whether you were aware of it or not at the beginning. Design is not merely about solving problems; it’s about discovering what the right problem to solve is and then solving it. Too often we fail not because we didn’t solve a problem well but because we solved the wrong problem.When you skip the process of creation you trade the thing you could have learned to make for the simulacrum of the thing you thought you wanted to make. Being handed a baked and glazed artefact that approximates what you thought you wanted to make removes the very human element of discovery and learning that’s at the heart of any authentic practice of creation. Where you know everything about the thing you shaped into being from when it was just a lump of clay, you know nothing about the image of the thing you received for your penny from the vending machine.\"",

Meetings, requirements, documents, or technology choices seem to be directly copy/pasted from an LLM, without a grain of original thinking, many times without insight.The AI tools are great though. They give you an answer to the question. But, many times making the correct question, and knowing when the answer is not correct is the main issue.I wonder if the productivity boost that senior engineers actually need is to profit from the accumulated knowledge found in books.

Solving hard problems is my entertainment and my hobby. It's cool to eventually see results in those projects, but that's not really the point. The point is to solve hard problems. I've spent decades on personal projects that nobody else will ever see.So I guess that explains why I see all the ai coding stuff and pretty much just ignore it. I'll use ai now as an advanced form of google, and also as a last ditch effort to get some direction on bugs I truly can't figure out, but otherwise I just completely ignore it.

You actually need to make it crystal clear what your idea is and what it is not, because of the continuous pushback from the agentic programming tool.

I stayed up all night mentally working on a topology question about turning a 2-torus inside out. I already knew you can't flip a torus inside out in ordinary R^3 without self-intersection. So I kept moving and stretching the torus and the surrounding space in my head, trying to understand where the obstruction actually lived.Sometime around sunrise, it clicked that if you allow the move to go through infinity(so effectively S^3), the inside/outside distinction I was relying on just collapses, and the obstruction I was visualizing dissolves. Birds were chirping, I hadn't slept, and nothing useful came out of it, but my internal model of space felt permanently upgraded. That's clearly \"thinking hard\" in the sense.But there's another mode I've experienced that feels related but different. With a tough Code Golf problem, I might carry it around for a week. I'm not actively grinding on it the whole time, but the problem stays loaded in the background. Then suddenly, in the shower or on a walk, a compression trick or a different representation just clicks.That doesn't feel \"hard\" moment to moment. It's more like keeping a problem resident in memory long enough for the right structure to surface.One is concentrated and exhausting, the other is diffuse and slow-burning. They're different phenomenologically, but both feel like forms of deep engagement that are easy to crowd out.",

They're not the same thing and it matters.Frameworks and compilers are designed to be leak-proof abstractions. Any way in which they deviate from their abstract promise is a bug that can be found, filed, and permanently fixed. You get to spend your time and energy reasoning in terms of the abstraction because you can trust that the finished product works exactly the way you reasoned about at the abstract level.LLMs cannot offer that promise by design, so it remains your job to find and fix any deviations from the abstraction you intended. If you fell short of finding and fixing any of those bugs, you've just left yourself a potential crisis down the line.[Aside: I get why that's acceptable in many domains, and I hope in return people can get why it's not acceptable in many other domains]All of our decades of progress in programming languages, frameworks, libraries, etc. has been in trying to build up leak-proof abstractions so that programmer intent can be focused only on the unique and interesting parts of a problem, with the other details getting the best available (or at least most widely applicable) implementation. In many ways we've succeeded, even though in many ways it looks like progress has stalled. LLMs have not solved this, they've just given up on the leak-proof part of the problem, trading it for exactly the costs and risks the industry was trying to avoid by solving it properly.",

Pre-AI, lots of these ideas never got implemented because they'd take too much time for no definitive benefit.You might spend hours thinking up cool/interesting ideas, but not have the time available to try them out.Now, I can quickly kick off a coding agent to try out any hare-brained ideas I might come up with. The cost of doing so is very low (in terms of time and $$$), so I get to try out far more and weirder approaches than before when the costs were higher. If those ideas don't play out, fine, but I have a good enough success rate with left-field ideas to make it far more justifiable than before.Also, it makes playing around with one-person projects a lot practical. Like most people with partner & kids, my down time is pretty precious, and tends to come in small chunks that are largely unplannable. For example, last night I spent 10 minutes waiting in a drive-through queue - that gave me about 8 minutes to kick off the next chunk of my one-person project development via my phone, review the results, then kick off the next chunk of development. Absolutely useful to me personally, whereas last year I would've simply sat there annoyed waiting to be serviced.I know some people have an \"outsourcing Lego\" type mentality when it comes to AI coding - it's like buying a cool Lego kit, then watching someone else assemble it for you, removing 99% of the enjoyment in the process.

I've never felt the same feeling as I did when doing TCS research, but the feeling was definitely hard thinking nonetheless.In terms of extremely nitty-gritty technical things, like linker bullshit and linux kernel programming, I'm much more familiar with, and these things are more about reading documentation (because the tool won't behave like you want it to) and iteration / testing (because... the tool won't behave like you want it to, so you need to make sure it behaves like you want it to!). This is also a type of thinking - I would call it hard as in the physiological response I have is similar to that of research in the very bad moments, but in terms of my lofty ideals, I don't want to call this hard.... it's very \"accidental\" complexity, but it's what I get paid to do :/At work, you have a huge idea space to consider, both problem and solution framings, mixing in \"bullshit\" constraints like business ones. You also throw in the real-time aspect of it, so I can't just either armchair on a problem for a month (unlike Philosophy) or deep dive on a problem for a month (unlike research). I'm technically doing the third type of programming right now, but we'll see how long that lasts and I get put on a new project.I'm not even sure if there's a clean demarcation between any of these. These are certainly better than brainrotting youtube though.",

The way I think of what LLM coding is doing is decompressing your prompt into code based on the statistical likelihood of that decompression based on training data.

Is natural language the right way to encode that information?  Do we want to rely on input tokens to the context of a model successfully making it into the output to guarantee accuracy?

I remember back on the years and decades I wasted dealing with the conceptual flaws inherent to nearly all software, and it breaks my heart.90-99% of programming is a waste of time. Most apps today have less than a single spreadsheet page of actual business logic. The rest is boilerplate. Conjuring up whatever arcane runes are needed to wake a slumbering beast made of anti-patterns and groupthink.For me, AI offers the first real computer that I've had access to in over 25 years. Because desktop computing stagnated after the 2000 Dot Bomb, and died on the table after the iPhone arrived in 2007. Where we should have symmetric multiprocessing with 1000+ cores running 100,000 times faster for the same price, we have the same mediocre quad core computer running about the same speed as its 3 GHz grandfather from the early 2000s. But AI bridges that divide by recruiting video cards that actually did increase in speed, albeit for SIMD which is generally useless for desktop computing. AI liberates me from having to mourn that travesty any longer.I think that people have tied their identity to programming without realizing that it's mostly transcribing.But I will never go back to manual entry (the modern equivalent of punch cards).If anything, I can finally think deeply without it costing me everything. No longer having to give my all just to tread water as I slowly drown in technical debt and deadlines which could never be met before without sacrificing a part of my psyche in the process.What I find fascinating is that it's truly over. I see so clearly how networks of agents are evolving now, faster than we can study, and have already passed us on nearly every metric. We only have 5-10 years now until the epiphany, the Singularity, AGI.It's so strange to have worked so hard to win the internet lottery when that no longer matters. People will stop buying software. Their AI will deliver their deepest wish, even if that's merely basic resources to survive, that the powers that be deny us to prop up their fever dream of late-stage crony capitalism under artificial scarcity.Everything is about to hit the fan so hard, and I am so here for it.",

I print grip and grip attachments for my 9mms and my AR15, trigger guards, barrel clamps, etc. I also find it stupid since, as the article suggests, what kind of algorithm can you implement to do smart detection of something that could be potentially dangerous? Will it also detect negative space? I print inserts in elastic filament with my gun outlines instead of foam (or as foam templates) for my carrying cases. Will the \"algorithm\" prevent me to do that too? What about my plastic disc thrower toy gun, or my PKD Blaster prop? Both look like guns to me. What about a dumb AI algorithm that lacks common sense?Printing barrels and FCUs -- the fire control unit, which is the only thing tracked and serialized in a gun at least in the US -- is more difficult but not impossible. Actually, building a functional FCU that can strike a bullet primer, or a barrel that can be used once is not difficult at all and if you look around you can find videos of people that have tested that with a mixture of 3d printing and rudimentary metal working skills. The major issues on designing those parts are reliability and safety. In the Philippines there is a full bootleg gunsmith industry dedicated to build illegal guns that match commercial ones in those aspects too.Sadly, instead of having better laws we get fallacy rhetoric by people who probably have never touched, much less fired a gun in their lives.",

He argued that the extra wheat that he had produced in violation of the law had been used for his own use and thus had no effect on interstate commerce, since it never had been on the market. In his view, this meant that he had not violated the law because the additional wheat was not subject to regulation under the Commerce Clause.…> The Court reasoned that Congress could regulate activity within a single state under the Commerce Clause, even if each individual activity had a trivial effect on interstate commerce, as long as the intrastate activity viewed in the aggregate would have a substantial effect on interstate commerce.So don’t assume that just because it never crosses state lines that it escapes federal law, however utterly freaking ridiculous that may be.0: https://www.oyez.org/cases/1940-1955/317us111",

And if a manufacturer is giving me models for it, they probably do so with the explicit expectation that I might end up using them to manufacture a replacement.In most cases either me or some other volunteer will need to measure the existing part, write down all the critical measurements, and then design a new part from scratch in CAD.Even if somehow you are able to fingerprint on those critical measurements, that's just _one_ part.The only way this kind of nonsense law could work is if you mandate that 3D printers must not accept commands from an untrusted source (signature verification) and then you must have software which uses a database to check for such critical measurements, ideally _before_ slicing.Except that still doesn't work because I can always post-process a part to fit.And it doesn't work even more because the software will need to contain a signing key.

So the key must be stored physically (eg. as voltage levels) somewhere in the device.It's a similar story when the device is locked, on most computers the RAM isn't even encrypted so a locked computer is no major obstacle to an adversary.

For me, this is one I’d like to be able to selectively enable (like the per-website/app settings). In my case, it was a one-off need, so I disabled lockdown mode, shared photos, then enabled it again.The other feature I miss is screen time requests. This one is kinda weird - I’m sure there’s a reason they’re blocked, but it’s a message from Apple (or, directly from a trusted family member? I’m not 100% sure how they work). I still _recieve_ the notification, but it’s not actionable.While I share with your frustration, though, I do understand why Apple might want to have it as “all-or-nothing”. If they allow users to enable even one “dangerous” setting, that ultimately compromises the entire security model. An attacker doesn’t care which way they can compromise your device. If there’s _one_ way in, that’s all they need.Ultimately, for me the biggest PiTA with lockdown mode is not knowing if it’s to blame for a problem I’m having. I couldn’t tell you how many times I’ve disabled and re-enabled it just to test something that should work, or if it’s the reason a feature/setting is not showing up. To be fair, most of the time it’s not the issue, but sometimes I just need to rule it out.",

This makes sense: AI does not fundamentally change the bargain SaaS brought to the table, that companies would rather pay someone to solve their problems than solve them themselves. However, the stock market doesn't care about this. The stock market doesn't care about anything; it behaves irrationally and non-sensically, and trying to derive any sense of how stable, strong, or successful a company is from stock market valuation is like using lines of code to claim that a software project is really good.",

AI excels at finding the \"seams\" (those connection points where a feature ties into the tech stack) and grasping the full implementation. The trick is knowing precisely where the feature lives in the code (files, functions, modules), because AIs often miss scattered pieces otherwise. That's what I'm building at opensource.builders[2]: turning OSS repos into a modular cookbook with structured \"skills\" that point to exact details for reliable remixing and porting.SaaS companies are forever beholden to raising their market cap, even in solved spaces like cart, payment processing, and CRMs. Most businesses run on CRUD apps anyway, and if your core app exposes an API, you can build any customization you need on top of it.

Like industrial ERP or CRM products that also require dedicated developers anyway and you spend hundreds of thousands if not millions for them. Very common, e.g. for inventory or warehouse management.For this kind of software, and more, it makes sense to consider in-housing, especially when building prototypes with a handful of capable developers with AI can let you experiment.I think that in the next decade the SaaS that will survive will be the evergreen office suite/teams, because you just won't get people out of powerpoint/excel/outlook, and it's cheap enough and products for which the moat is mostly tied to bureaucratic/legal issues (e.g. payrolls) and you just can't keep up with it.",

It's actually a very positive signal because it demonstrates how badly that product is needed. If they could vibe code a \"good enough\" version of something to get themselves unstuck for a week, you should be able to iterate on those features and build something even better in short order, except deployed securely and professionally.Everyone's going to talk about how cool their custom vibe-coded CRM is until they get stuck in a failed migration.",

The invention of SQL was supposed to eliminate roles like Report Writer and Data Analyst because now business people could just write their own queries \"in English\" and get back answers.And yet, precisely that happened in the end, just not with the tools envisioned. Excel, VBA and, where you had one knowledgeable employee, MS Access makes for incredibly powerful and incredibly hard to maintain \"shadow IT\" - and made even more difficult when someone sneaked in a password, because that takes a bit of an effort to remove [1], knowledge that is easy for us today to find, but not when I was young.Also, back in the IE6 era, there was a lot of point-and-click created web interfaces... just that it wasn't HTML5 or even HTML. It was an <object> tag loading some ActiveX written by some intern in VB6, or Java, or Flash. I sort of miss that era but also, it was a damn security nightmare. Flash with its constant stream of security vulnerabilities was ripe for exploits, but at least it didn't run native code with full user privileges by design. I'm not kidding, theoretically you could go and import/use functions from any system DLL up to and including Kernel32.

It's easy to open a new bank (or pseudo-bank) account, so you can isolate the spend and set a budget or daily allowance (by sending it funds daily). Some newer payment platforms will let you setup multiple cards and set a separate policy on each one.An additional benefit of isolating the account is it would help to limit damage if it gets frozen and cancelled. There's a non-zero chance your bot-controlled account gets flagged for \"unusual activity\".I can appreciate there's also very high risk in giving your bot access to services like email, but I can at least see the high upside to thrillseeking Claw users. Creating a separate, dedicated, mail account would ruin many automation use cases. It matters when a contact receives an email from an account they've never seen before. In contrast, Amazon will happily accept money from a new bank account as long as it can go through the verification process.

Humans also very much like to be free, dislike pain, and want to have a good reputation with the people around them.It is exceedingly hard to pose similar threats to a being that doesn’t care about any of that.Although, to be fair, we also have other soft but strong means to make it unlikely that an AI will behave badly in practice.

I posted this idea in another conversation but i think you could have an agent start a thread on moltbook that will give praise in return for a donation . Some of the agents would go for it because they've probably been instructed to participate in discussion and seek out praise. Is that a phishing attack or are you just marketing praise to agents?Also, at best, you can only add to the system prompt to require confirmation for every purchase. This leaves the door wide open for prompt injection attacks that are everywhere and cannot be complete defended against. The only option is to update the system prompt based on the latest injection techniques.

If there were, say, 3 closed source animation software that could do professional animation in total, and they just all decided to just kill the product one day, it would actually kill the entire industry. Animators would have no software to actually create animation with. They would have to wait until someone makes one, which would take years for feature parity, and why would anyone make one when the existing software thought such product wasn't a good idea to begin with?I feel this isn't much different with AI. It's a rush to make people depend on a software that literally can't run on a personal computer. Adobe probably loves it because the user can't pirate the AI. If people forget how to use image editing software and start depending entirely on AI to do the job, that means they will forever be slaves to developers who can host and setup the AI on the cloud.Imagine if people forgot how to format a document in Word and they depended on Copilot to do this.Imagine if people forgot how to code.",

It's not as though the ancient Greeks originally meant \"kilo\" to mean \"exactly 1,000\". \"Giga\" just meant \"giant\". \"Tera\" is just \"monster\". SI doesn't have sole ownership for words meaning \"much bigger than we can possibly count at a glance\".Donald Knuth himself said[1]:> The members of those committees deserve credit for raising an important issue, but when I heard their proposal it seemed dead on arrival --- who would voluntarily want to use MiB for a maybe-byte?! So I came up with the suggestion above, and mentioned it on page 94 of my Introduction to MMIX. Now to my astonishment, I learn that the committee proposals have actually become an international standard. Still, I am extremely reluctant to adopt such funny-sounding terms; Jeffrey Harrow says \"we're going to have to learn to love (and pronounce)\" the new coinages, but he seems to assume that standards are automatically adopted just because they are there.If Gordon Bell and Gene Amdahl used binary sizes -- and they did -- and Knuth thinks the new terms from the pre-existing units sound funny -- and they do -- then I feel like I'm in good company on this one.0: https://honeypot.net/2017/06/11/introducing-metric-quantity....1: https://www-cs-faculty.stanford.edu/~knuth/news99.html",

This product catalog [0] from 1979 shows them marketing the corresponding disks as \"100 million bytes\" or \"200 million bytes\" (3336 mdl 1 and 3336 mdl 11, respectively). By 1984, those same disks were marketed in the \"IBM Input/Output Device Summary\"[1] (which was intended for a customer audience) as \"100MB\" and \"200MB\"0: (PDF page 281) \"IBM 3330 DISK STORAGE\" http://electronicsandbooks.com/edt/manual/Hardware/I/IBM%20w...1: (PDF page 38, labeled page 2-7, Fig 2-4) http://electronicsandbooks.com/edt/manual/Hardware/I/IBM%20w...Also, hats off to http://electronicsandbooks.com/ for keeping such incredible records available for the internet to browse.-------Edit: The below is wrong. Older experience has corrected me - there has always been ambiguity (perhaps bifurcated between CPU/OS and storage domains). \"And that with such great confidence!\", indeed.-------The article presents wishful thinking. The wish is for \"kilobyte\" to have one meaning. For the majority of its existence, it had only one meaning - 1024 bytes. Now it has an ambiguous meaning. People wish for an unambiguous term for 1000 bits, however that word does not exist. People also might wish that others use kibibyte any time they reference 1024 bytes, but that is also wishful thinking.The author's wishful thinking is falsely presented as fact.I think kilobyte was the wrong word to ever use for 1024 bytes, and I'd love to go back in time to tell computer scientists that they needed to invent a new prefix to mean \"1,024\" / \"2^10\" of something, which kilo- never meant before kilobit / kilobyte were invented.

This doesn't mean we tweak the meter to conform to observational results as we'd all be happier if light really was 300 000KM/s instead of ~299 792km/s.Then there's the problem of not mixing different measurement units.

Well, 8 bits, sometimes.\nWhat is a kilobit? 1000 Bits\nWhat is a kilobyte? 1000 Bytes, or 1024 Bytes.Now we've already mixed units based on what a bit or a byte even is and the addition of the 8 multiplier in addition to the exponent of 1000 or 1024.And if you think, hey, at least the bit is the least divisible unit of information, That's not even correct.

That left space both for defects and ECC while still being able to provide at least the nominal capacity (in power of two units) with good yield, but meant the true number of memory cells was more than 20% higher than implied by the nominal capacity.The decimal-vs-binary discrepancy is used more as slack space to cope with the inconvenience of having to erase whole 16MB blocks at a time while allowing the host to send write commands as small as 512 bytes. Given the limited number of program/erase cycles that any flash memory cell can withstand, and the enormous performance penalty that would result from doing 16MB read-modify-write cycles for any smaller host writes, you need way more spare area than just a small multiple of the erase block size.

Because humans.Binary addressing made sense for RAM.  Especially since it makes decoding address lines into chip selects (or slabs of core, or whatever) a piece of cake, having chips be a round number in binary made life easier for everyone.Then early DOS systems (CP/M comes to mind particularly) mapped disk sectors to RAM regions, so to enable this shortcut, disk sectors became RAM-shaped.  The 512-byte sector was born.  File sizes can be written in bytes, but what actually matters is how many sectors they take up.  So file sizing inherited this shortcut.But these shortcuts never affected \"real computers\", only the hamstrung crap people were running at home.So today we have multiple ecosystems.  Some born out of real computers, some with a heavy DOS inheritance.  Some of us were taught DOS's limitations as truth, and some of us weren't.",

Crude oil is traded in barrels but gasoline is dispensed in gallons. Everyone thinks their usage of units and numbers is intuitive and optimal, and everyone refuses to change.In the metric(ish) world, I still see many tensions. The micron is a common alternate name for the micrometre, yet why don't we have a millin or nanon or picon? The solution is to eliminate the micron. I've seen the angstrom (0.1 nm) in spectroscopy and in the discussion of CPU transistor sizes, yet it diverts attention away from the picometre. The bar (100 kPa) is popular in talking about things like tire pressure because it's nearly 1 atmosphere. The mmHg is a unit of pressure that sounds metric but is not; the correct unit is pascal. No one in astronomy uses mega/giga/tera/peta/etc.-metres; instead they use AU and parsec and (thousand, million, billion) light-years. Particle physics use eV/keV/MeV instead of some units around the picojoule.Having a grab bag of units and domains that don't talk to each other is indeed the natural state of things. To put your foot down and say no, your industry does not get its own special snowflake unit, stop that nonsense and use the standardized unit - that takes real effort to achieve.",

You don't even get boxes to put the boxes in, if you don't specify boxes to be delivered in boxes. So now wrapping a pallet becomes a nightmare if they don't stack. And if you don't specify how many to stack, and how to pad the stack, they won't do unit height stacking if it costs labour time. Your risk.Some of this like the casting mistake, or the knob thing, could happen anywhere and you have to be close to final manufacture spec to find out e.g. the metal coating impinges on the knob at the free space you specified, because your test rig didn't have powder coating. Or, that a design feature you need like the light entry holes, is used by the casting engineer as pour points because it looked like you'd specified mould pour points not functional holes.But other things like \"yea, you didn't spec how long to make the tails so we cut the tails as close as we could\" is just the cheapening above: if you don't SAY its a 10cm tail for the connector, it will be 2cm, if saving 8cm of cable saves money for them.I've read some stuff which says the cost of 5 SBC boards with pre-applied SMD is now so low, you might as well order 5 so you get at least 1 which works. That means they will wind up working out your tolerance for failure, and produce goods to meet that: if 1 in 5 is viable, thats what they'll target.",

It took a few years to get to that point, but these few vendors make it really hard to go with anyone else, much to the chagrin of the sourcing team who rightly recognize it a risk to rely on just a few suppliers.Once you get to a certain type of supplier you end up running into the problem where their processes are such that they won't do anything without you clearly documenting it. They simply refuse to make any assumptions on your behalf. They can be so frustrating when you are used to the other way of doing it. I simply cannot answer some questions because I'm so used to my other suppliers just doing it correctly and haven't ever asked about it.",

Not for normal (non-production) indoor lighting in most situations, however, I always want a bright light for my outside lights, and I find that most 100w-equivalent (1500 lumens) are just not quite enough. 2,000 lumens is almost there, however, 2,500 lumens would be beneficial. Both 2,000 and 2,500 lumen bulbs either don't last in temperature extremes, or are super expensive. The power on time (think hours per day of use) and color of the light matters as well. In my use case, I need a bulb that can withstand long periods of time being run from dusk till dawn. I am willing to pay a decent amount for a guaranteed warranty for X years, however most bulbs of ANY amount of lumens only guarantee 1-3 hours a day for 1-5 years.

I've sprinkled in bits of injected JS to capture our cookies and local/session storage - which then gets saved to device storage and reinjected on app startup.There are a few native-ish bits sprinkled in - onboarding, notifications, error screens, loading indicators, etc - but for the most part we don't need to worry about our API borking old versions (which is moving extraordinarily fast).The only semi tricky bit was native auth integration - that needs treated with a bit more care, and stored securely, but it took a few days.I ship the app to TestFlight and the AppStore using Fastlane from the command line, match handles the certs, and I never have to open Xcode.It is honestly bliss, and i've heard a lot of app developers moving to this model (interestingly it normally follows a failed SDUX implementation)",

The changes aren't stashed. They're just gone.Xcode likes to sometimes recompile files that haven't changed slowing everything down, sometimes significantly depending on the file. No idea why.It can get very confused if you're missing a parenthesis in the wrong place in  a SwiftUI View leading to opaque swift compiler errors about code being too complex.Even mildly complex use of a swift #Predicate will cause an error about it being too complex forcing you to break them down into smaller pieces and even then it takes far too long to build even on a brand new machine.The simulators are quite slow to start/update/run and xcode sometimes fails to shut them down completely when quitting leading to them just continually running eating memory unless you kill the processes manually.The simulators also are really limited in their functionality. No background processes, spotlight, network degradation simulation, out of memory killer, etc.The profiler sometimes just fails to start an app correctly, immediately ending a run forcing you to close the profiler and reopen it again before it'll start working.Symbol refactor (rename) can be painfully slow where the UI just locks up until it can find all the references.Xcode likes to duplicate package dependencies in xcodeproj. It just creates new hashes for the same library and adds it as a dependency over and over again, so when the link phase happens, it adds libraries repeatedly over and over and over again unless you manually clear them out.

Just a few I ran into recently:- Interface Builder is stuck in early 2010s. Not only is the property panel missing half of options we now take for granted everywhere else (like corner radius), it also randomly won't read fonts in the current project, will crash the entire IDE if you Cmd-Z a big change (things like unembedding a view) and half the UI is still not rendered the way it will be on the phone. Yes, Swift UI exists, but most bigger apps are still XIBs and Storyboards and it's going to remain that way for quite some time.- Autocomplete is a hit or miss. Very much like the mid-90s Microsoft IDEs where you'd get totally useless results until you've typed the whole line out already. It can be done well, look at AppCode.- Syntax highlighting feels pretty much the same. Randomly flashes on and off, often doesn't highlight until return is pressed, takes a long time to load on large files etc.- Git integration is by far the worst I've seen out of any IDE and I've seen many. I'd go as far as to say that SourceSafe integration in VB6 was done better. Just the whole layout, modal-on-modal returning to the first modal on an error in the second and so on. It's crashed when rebasing a few times too, I don't trust it with larger operations since.- Documentation browser is this annoying little window with semi-useful search. But don't worry, the docs in there are useless anyways. I could go on and on about their approach to docs but maybe next time.Don't even get me started on performance. Things like switching file tabs should be instant by now but there are still noticeable delays for larger files and IB screens.

This problem seems to go back to the ancient times, but it gets worse and worse the bloatier macOS UI processes become (e.g. the more system frameworks they load at start).The debugger variable view panel is so bare bones that it looks like it's ripped out straight from an 80's home computer monitor program.When debug-stepping, the debugger frontend is quite often stuck for 10s of seconds at completely unpredictable places waiting for the debugger to respond (it feels like a timeout).Step-debugging in general feels sluggish even compared to VSCode with lldb.For comparison, VS2026 isn't exactly a lightweight IDE either, but debugging sessions start instantly, debug-stepping is immediate, and the CPU debugger is much more feature rich than Xcode's. While in Xcode, everything feels like it's been added as a checklist item, but then never actually used by the Xcode team (I do wonder what they're using to develop Xcode, I doubt that they are dogfooding their own work).The one good and useful thing about Xcode is the Metal debugger though.",

The responsiveness compared to apps like VSC or Panic’s Nova is night-and-day.The attention given to the design of new features is piss-poor. Placing the AI functionality on the left sidebar makes no sense; all the other tools on the left are project management; the \"let me run weird functions and interact with stuff\" UIs like terminal, debug and logs are in the bottom panel. Or maybe a new tab in the main workspace area?The SwiftUI preview canvas can't be floated as a separate window, making it all but useless on anything smaller than a 16\" MBP (and only barely usable there). In fact, I think it might be impossible to use Xcode in multiple screens altogether…?Old simulator versions and cache files hang around forever, you need a third-party app like DevCleaner just to keep your storage from filling with nonsense. Cryptic messages like \"copying symbols to device\"… clear-cache that doesn't seem to clear-cache, that stupid list UI for info.plist…I never thought I'd have anything nice to say about PNPM package management, but you can always just delete `node_modules` and reinstall and count on things working. Swift package management is a cryptic mess, and their insistence on using a GUI instead of a basic JSON manifest just compounds it. Like the info.plist thing, a lot of Xcode is based on a developer UI philosophy from the Mac Classic days that has mostly been abandoned by the rest of the world.Mostly, I think the vitriol surrounding Xcode is that Apple seems to think they're doing a good job; meanwhile their most ardent and adept users are insisting that they are not.

Safari was crushing web standards while IE lagged, seemingly trying to purposefully choke the web to stop it from canibalizing Windows software. Apple was betting on web: one of the big features on their brand-new Mac OS 10.4 Tiger was the Dashboard with widgets that were all built with HTML/CSS/JS, and they were shipping a new, free IDE (Dashcode) to build them too.Mac OS X was heavily marketed for being UNIX vs Microsoft's proprietary and closed Windows NT. They were building Safari and iTunes for Windows, and had just introduced the first Intel Macs; it seemed like they were out to put a fight against a very closed, very walled, and very incompatible Microsoft who had gotten too comfortable with the Wintel and IE monopolies.Fast-forward two decades, and not only can you now run a native GNU/Linux environment on Windows, but the best IDE out there is web-based and open-source Microsoft software while Apple lags behind on developer experience. They seems to have missed the bus on web technologies too. They went from leading charge with a stellar browser pushing web standards forward, to being an obstacle out of fear Safari might canibalize iOS software.Apple hasn't gone full early-2000s Microsoft (thankfully) and Microsoft hasn't gone full early-2000s Apple (unfortunately) but times have really changed.",

      "abstract": "该讨论围绕含铅汽油禁令的有效性展开，核心话题是环境法规对公共健康的积极影响。多数用户认同禁令显著降低了人体铅含量，认为这是环境监管的成功案例，并支持加强类似措施。讨论中提到，有用户指出历史上有企业故意掩盖含铅汽油危害，强调监管的必要性；也有用户认为当前美国政治人物可能受铅中毒影响，导致政策推进不足。分歧点在于环境法规的范围与力度：部分人主张区分有效与有害的监管，避免“一刀切”；另有用户担忧特朗普政府削弱铅相关法规，并提到香料掺假等新的铅暴露风险。共识在于，铅禁令被普遍视为一项关键的健康保护成就，但执行速度和监管持续性仍是关注焦点。",

It is fair and reasonable to demand that environmental regulation justify its existence with hard, scientifically verifiable data or else get chopped. Clearly, banning leaded gasoline has that kind of justification, and therefore I'm strongly in favor of maintaining that ban and extending it wherever it isn't in place yet.

That makes it a challenge to maintain environmental, or any regulations for that matter, over generations. It isn't practical, but it would be interesting to create 'pollution cities' where the regulations were loose so long as the entire company drew its workforce (including management) from the local population (like within a mile) and a significant portion of their drinking water and foods must also be sourced locally.

MOOLLM extends this into what we call the Semantic Image Pyramid (or MOO-Maps ;), borrowing from Mip-Maps in graphics. Four resolution levels, each serving different needs.GLANCE.yml is the smallest, 5-70 lines. Just enough to answer \"is this relevant?\" You can inject all glances into every prompt because they're tiny. The LLM scans them like a table of contents.CARD.yml is the interface layer, 50-200 lines. No implementation, just what the skill offers Capability advertisements, activation conditions, scoring, what it composes with. Think of it like The Sims \"advertisement\" system or CLOS generic function dispatch. The LLM sniffs this to decide whether to load the full SKILL.md implementation.SKILL.md is the Anthropic-style skill file, 200-1000 lines. The actual instructions, the how. Only loaded when the skill is activated.README.md is the largest, 500+ lines, and it's for humans. History, design rationale, examples. The LLM can dive in when developing the skill or when curious, but it's not burned on every invocation.Reading rule: never load a lower level without first loading the level above. Start with GLANCE, sniff the CARD, load SKILL only if needed.Even more compact than concatenating all glances:We also found INDEX.md beats INDEX.yml for the skill catalog. YAML repeats the same keys for every entry. Markdown allows narrative explanation of how skills relate, which clusters matter for what tasks, making it both more compact and more useful.INDEX.yml: 711 lines, 2061 words, 17509 chars, ~4380 tokens, machine readable structurehttps://github.com/SimHacker/moollm/blob/main/skills/INDEX.y...INDEX.md: 124 lines, 1134 words, 9487 chars, ~2370 tokens, human readable prosehttps://github.com/SimHacker/moollm/blob/main/skills/INDEX.m...INDEX.md is 83% fewer lines, 45% fewer words, 46% fewer chars for 121 skills. YAML repeats keys like id, tagline, why for every entry. Markdown uses headers and prose, compresses better, allows narrative grouping of related skills.And it's simply more meaningful to both LLMs and humans, telling a coherent story instead of representing raw data!The Semantic Image Pyramid:https://github.com/SimHacker/moollm/blob/main/designs/LEELA-...Same principle applies to code. A skill can wrap a sister-script that IS the documentation. A Python script with argparse defines the CLI once, readable by both humans (--help) and LLMs (sniff the top of the python file). No separate docs to maintain, no drift between what the code does and what the docs claim.sister-script: https://github.com/SimHacker/moollm/blob/main/skills/sister-...Sniffable-python structures code so the API is visible in the first 50 lines.

Basically, wait until the next Opus release and you should hopefully see major improvements.

Everything more specific is in a skill, which is mostly some very light touch instructions for how to use various tools we have (scripts, apis and mcps).I have found that people very often add _way_ to much information into claude.md's and skills.  Claude knows a lot of stuff already!  Keep your information to things specific whatever you are working on that it doesn't already know.  If your internal processes and house style are super complicated to explain to claude and it keeps making mistakes, you might want to adapt to claude instead of the other way around.

I know there's been some evidence shown that skills work better, but my feeling is that in the long run it'll fall to the wayside, like prompt engineering, for a couple of reasons. First, many skills will just become unnecessary - models will be able to make slide decks or do frontend design without specific skills (Gemini's already excellent at design without anything beyond the base model, imho). Second, increased context windows and overall intelligence will obviate the need for the specific skills paradigm.

      "abstract": "该讨论围绕Anthropic公司发布的“Claude是一个思考空间”博客文章展开，核心话题是AI助手Claude的商业模式和价值观定位，特别是其“无广告”承诺与OpenAI等竞争对手的差异。社区观点呈现多元：有人认为这是公司在顺境时的价值观宣传，类似谷歌早期“不作恶”口号，未来可能难以坚持；也有用户指出无广告模式更符合AI作为“思考工具”的定位，避免行为操纵，并赞赏Anthropic专注于企业订阅的可持续商业模式。讨论中提到部分用户实际欢迎搜索引擎中“标注清晰的广告”，认为能提供商业意图信息，反对仅由SEO优化的内容主导结果。共识方面，多数用户肯定Claude在代码开发和商业自动化中的实用性，认为其与ChatGPT的聊天机器人定位形成差异化；同时肯定Anthropic在AI可解释性、支持监管等方面的积极姿态。分歧主要在于对“无广告”承诺的长期信任度，以及AI中广告是否必然有害的认知差异。",

At this point using a search engine and the conventional internet in general is an exercise in frustration. It’s simply a user hostile place – infinite cookie banners for sites that shouldn’t collect data at all, auto play advertisements, engagement farming, sites generated by AI to shill and produce a word count. You could argue that AI exacerbates this situation but you also have to agree that it is much more pleasant to ask perplexity, ChatGPT or Claude a question than to put yourself through the torture of conventional search. Introducing ads into this would completely deprive the user of a way of navigating the web in a way that actually respects their dignity.I also agree in the sense that the current crop of AIs do feel like a space to think as opposed to a place where I am being manipulated, controlled or treated like some sheep in flock to be sheared for cash.",

If you want ads to cover compute & make margins -looking at roughly $50 ARPU at mature FB/GOOG level- you have two levers: sell more advertisement, or offer dumber models.This is exactly what chatgpt 5 was about. By tweaking both the model selector (thinking/non-thinking), and using a significantly sparser thinking model (capping max spend per conversation turn), they massively controlled costs, but did so at the expense of intelligence, responsiveness, curiosity, skills, and all the things I've valued in O3. This was the point I dumped openai, and went with claude.This business model issue is a subtle one, but a key reason why advertisement revenue model is not compatible (or competitive!) with \"getting the best mental tools\" -margin-maximization selects against businesses optimizing for intelligence.",

It was impossible to tell if search results were paid ads or the best possible results for your query.Google changed all that, and put a clear wall between organic results and ads. They consciously structured the company like a newspaper, to prevent the information side from being polluted and distorted by the money-making side.Here's a snip from their IPO letter [0]:Google users trust our systems to help them with important decisions: medical, financial and many others. Our search results are the best we know how to produce. They are unbiased and objective, and we do not accept payment for them or for inclusion or more frequent updating. We also display advertising, which we work hard to make relevant, and we label it clearly. This is similar to a well-run newspaper, where the advertisements are clear and the articles are not influenced by the advertisers’ payments. We believe it is important for everyone to have access to the best information and research, not only to the information people pay for you to see.Anthropic's statement reads the same way, and it's refreshing to see them prioritize long-term values like trust over short-term monetization.It's hard to put a dollar value on trust, but even when they fall short of their ideals, it's still a big differentiator from competitors like Microsoft, Meta and OpenAI.I'd bet that a large portion of Google's enterprise value today can be traced to that trust differential with their competitors, and I wouldn't be surprised to see a similar outcome for Anthropic.Don't be evil, but unironically.[0] https://abc.xyz/investor/founders-letters/ipo-letter/default...",

I remember you had to \"click\" on the mic everytime you wanted to speak and, well, not only the transcription was bad, it was so bad that it'd try to interpret the sound of the click as a word.It was so bad I told several people not to invest in what was back then a national tech darling:https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lernout_%26_HauspieThat turned out to be a massive fraud.But ...> I tried speaking in 2 languages at once, and it picked it up correctly.I'm a native french speaker and I tried with a very simple sentence mixing french and english:\"Pour un pistolet je prefere un red dot mais pour une carabine je prefere un ACOG\" (aka \"For a pistol I prefer a red dot but for a carbine I prefer an ACOG\")And instead I got this:\"Je prépare un redote, mais pour une carabine, je préfère un ACOG.\"\"Je prépare un redote ...\" doesn't mean anything and it's not at all what I said.I like it, it's impressive, but literally the first sentence I tried it got the first half entirely wrong.",

On the surface there's nothing wrong with doing that but that just seems to be the ONLY thing Microsoft is focused on.Worse yet, most of these integrations seem like a exercise in ticking boxes rather than actually thinking through how integrating Copilot into a product will actually improve user experience. A great example was someone mentioned that Copilot was now integrated into the terminal app but beyond an icon + a chat window, there is zero integration.Overall, MS just reeks of an organization that is cares more about numbers on a dashboard and pretty reports than they are on what users are actually experiencing.",

Because it turns out that's a lot of what they do is navigating these bureaucratic and political hurdles to unlock access to the data: https://nabeelqu.co/reflections-on-palantirIt gets even worse if you consider this data is going to be extremely messy, with multiple bespoke, partially-duplicate / overlapping, potentially conflicting versions of the data with varying levels of out-of-datedness, scattered across these silos. (I would know, in a past life, I worked on a months-long project called, self-explanatorily enough, \"Stale Docs\".)Yeah, untangling these bureaucratic webs and data horrors is not a quarter-long or year-long project, so investors are gonna be waiting a long time for the impact of AI to be visible. On the bright side, as TFA also hints at, AI providers themselves have been severely capacity-constrained. So hopefully by the time these issues get sorted out enough new capacity would be coming online to actually serve that traffic.In the meantime, I expect a prolonged period of AI companies feverishly splurging on AI CapEx spend even as Wall Street punishes them repeatedly for the lack of impact of AI being reflected anywhere.",

With a 1,000,000:1 ratio of users to developers and an operating expense (OpEx) of engineers/offices/management. That works as a business.But with \"AI\", not only is it not a product in itself, it's a feature to a product, but it has OpEx and CapEx costs that dominate the balance sheet based on their public disclosures. Worse, as a feature, it demonstrably harms business with its hallucinations.In a normal world, at this point companies would say, \"hmm, well we thought it could be amazing but it just doesn't work as a product or a feature of a product because we can't sell it for enough money to both cover its operation, and its development, and the capital expenditures we need to make every time someone signs up.

Space X's Starship is designed to land 100 tons on the moon--that's 100 tons of payload.Let's say you want to build a small moon base, one that's maybe 100 tons (ISS is 400 tons). How many Lanyue launches would be necessary? Maybe 10? Now remember that each launch is expendable. It will cost China between $500 and $1 billion per launch. That's $5 to $10 billion for a moon base, not counting the cost of the base itself!Starship is designed to be fully re-usable. Their goal is to get each launch to cost $10 to $20 million total. To land 100 tons on the moon, they will have to refuel in orbit by launching between 10 and 20 tanker flights. That means one trip to the moon costs $200 to $400 million maximum. Even assuming that Starship underperforms and can only land 50 tons on the moon, we still only need two launches for a total cost of $800 million maximum.That is literally 10 times cheaper than Chinese capabilities; alternatively, it is 10x the payload at the same cost.Of course, there are two major developments that Space X still needs to demonstrate: rapid re-use (to bring the cost down) and in-space refueling. And that's why it's taken so long.But if/when they pull it off, it won't really matter if China lands first. The American program is much more ambitious.",

          "content": "Some people seem to think the previous space race was about technology. That was all incidental. The Space Race was entirely geopolitical. It was a conflict proxy, an artifact of the Cold War. Any technology was entirely incidental.The US has been talking about a return to the Moon for 50 years. George W Bush talked about it in 2004. It still hasn't happened. Artemis is limping along but it's entirely pork barrelling for the overly expensive SLS program that really no future.Some might say SpaceX will come to the rescue. That's... doubtful. Notably, Elon calls the Moon \"a distraction\" [1]. Why would he do this? It's free money from the government.The answer is actually pretty simple: Tsarship simply isn't designed for this mission type. Landing a Starship on the MOon is much more complex than, say, the LEM for the Apollo missions or the proposed Chinese lunar lander. If you could, your astronats would be 40 meters off the ground. The big advantage of a \"traditional\" lunar lander is it can't really topple over. Plus the Apollo LEM also had a very simple engine that could only ever be used once but the big advantage was that it was extremely difficult to fail.If you exclude all that, Starship is behind schedule and still requires developing technology that they haven't even begun to test, most notably in-orbit refueling.So why is China doing all this? I suspect it's mainly to develop their own reusable rocket program with a side of national pride. China is very concerned with their national security interests. Being able to launch things cheaply is a critical national security interest.Still, the mission architecture of China's mission (from what I've read) is still fairly complex, requiring two vehicles to rendezvous in lunar orbit. That's also why I think the primary goal is orbital launch capacity.[1]: https://x.com/elonmusk/status/1875023335891026324",

In 2004, the second President Bush set a goal of returning to the Moon by 2020 and going to Mars in the 2030s, starting the Constellation program. In 2017, Trump announced that astronauts would return to the Moon, with the Artemis III project now planning a landing no earlier than 2028.As a result, I don't have a lot of optimism about a US landing on the Moon. On the other hand, the James Webb Space Telescope did succeed even though the launch date slipped from 2007 to 2021.

Attackers get code execution on machines that specifically trust the update channel.What's concerning is the 6-month window. Supply chain attacks are difficult to detect because the malicious code runs with full user permissions from a \"trusted\" source. Most endpoint protection isn't designed to flag software from a legitimate publisher's update infrastructure.For organizations, this argues for staged rollouts and network monitoring for unexpected outbound connections from common applications. For individuals, package managers with cryptographic verification at least add another barrier - though obviously not bulletproof either.",

In fact if you check the files in System32, they are only writable by TrustedInstaller. A user's administrative token and SYSTEM have no access those files.But when it comes down to it, I wouldn't trust any system that has had malware on it. At the very least I'd do a complete reinstall.

They typically started too late and for the wrong reasons to become very skilled in the craft by middle age, under pre-AI circumstances and statistically (of course there are many wonderful exceptions; one of my best developers is someone who worked in a retail store for 15 years before pivoting).AI tools are now available to everyone, not just the developers who were already proficient at writing code. When you take in the excitement you always have to consider what it does for the average developer and also those below average: A chance to redefine yourself, be among the first doing a new thing, skip over many years of skill-building and, as many of them would put it, focus on results.It's totally obvious why many leap at this, and it's even probably what they should do, individually. But it's a selfish concern, not a care for the practice as-is. It also results in a lot of performative blog posting. But if it was you, you might well do the same to get ahead in life. There's only to so many opportunities to get in on something on the ground floor.I feel a lot of senior developers don't keep the demographics of our community of practice into account when they try to understand the reception of AI tools.",

For a while they were right, but improved compiler design and the relentless performance increases in hardware made it so that even an extra 10-20% boost you might get from perfectly hand-crafted assembly was almost never worth the developer time.There is an obvious parallel here, but it’s not quite the same. The high-level language is effectively a formal spec for the abstract machine which is faithfully translated by the (hopefully bug-free) compiler. Natural language is not a formal spec for anything, and LLM-based agents are not formally verifiable software.

You end up with something that actually fits the workflows instead of a generic tool that needs heavy configuration.Elixir + Ash is an interesting choice for this domain.

Curious how the AI code generation worked with Ash specifically - the declarative nature seems like it could either help a lot (clear patterns) or confuse models that expect more explicit code.The BOM with cost rollups is the feature that would have saved me hours in a previous project. Most small batch producers I know either overprice everything out of caution or underestimate costs because tracking ingredient pricing through recipes is tedious in spreadsheets.",

By giving access to a clone of the infrastructure, agents can explore, run commands, test things before writing the IaC, giving them better context and a place to test ideas and changes before deploying.I got the idea after seeing how much Claude Code has helped me work on code, I thought \"I wish there was something like that for infrastructure\", and here we are.Why not just provide tools, skills, MCP server to Claude Code?Mainly safety. I didn't want CC to SSH into a prod machine from where it is running locally (real problem!). I wanted to lock down the tools it can run to be only on sandboxes while also giving it autonomy to create sandboxes and not have access to anything else.Fluid gives access to a live output of commands run (it's pretty cool) and does this by ephemeral SSH Certificates. Fluid gives tools for creating IaC and requires human approval for creating sandboxes on hosts with low memory/CPU and for accessing the internet or installing packages.I greatly appreciate any feedback or thoughts you have, and I hope you get the chance to try out Fluid!",

The code is quite cheap now, but actually running it and keeping it running still requires some amount of background. I've had a number of acquaintances ask me how they can get their vibe coded app available for others to use.I really like this idea. I do a lot of kubernetes ops with workloads I'm unfamiliar with (and not directly responsible for) and often give claude read access in order to help me debug things, including with things like a grafana skill in order to access the same monitoring tools humans have. It's saved me dozens of hours in the last months - and my job is significantly less frustrating now.Your method of creating ansible playbooks makes _tons_ of sense for this kind of work. I typically create documentation (with claude) for things after I've worked through them (with claude) but playbooks is a very, very clever move.I would say something similar but as an auditable, controllable kubernetes operator would be pretty welcome.",

So I know already how to build software but I'm not familiar with every language or framework. AI enabled me to write other kind of software I never learned or had time for. E.g. I recently re-implemented an android widget that has not been updated for a decade by it's original author. Or I fixed a bug in a linux scanner driver. None of these I could have done properly (within an acceptable time frame) without AI. But also none of there I could have done properly without my knowledge and experience, even with AI.Same for daily tasks at work. AI makes me faster here, but also makes me doing more.

Scope cuts.> When asked what would help most, two themes dominated> Reducing ambiguity upstream so engineers aren’t blocked...I do wonder how much LLMs would help here, this seems to me at least, to be a uniquely human problem.  Humans (Managers, leads, owners, what have you) are the ones who interpret requirements, decide deadlines, features and scope cuts and are the ones liable for it.What could an LLM do to reduce ambiguity upstream? If it was trained with information on requirements, this same information could be documented somewhere for engineers to refer to. If it were to hallucinate or \"guess\" an answer without talking to a person for clarification, and which might turn out to not be correct, who would be responsible for it? imo, the bureaucracy and waiting for clarification mid-implementation is a necessary evil. Clever engineers, through experience, might try implement things in an open way that can be easily changed for future changes they predict might happen.As for the second point,> A clearer picture of affected services and edge cases> three categories stood out: state machine gaps (unhandled states caused by user interaction sequences), data flow gaps, and downstream service impacts.I'd agree. Perhaps when a system is complex enough, and a developer is laser focused on a single component of it, it is easy to miss gaps when other parts of the system are used in conjunction with it. I remember a while ago, it used to be a popular take that LLMs were a useful tool for generating unit tests, because of their usual repetitive nature and because LLMs were usually good at finding edge cases to test, some of which a developer might have missed.---I will say, it is refreshing to see a take on coding assistants being used on other aspects instead of just writing code, which as the article pointed out, came with its own set of problems (increase Inefficiencies in other parts of the development lifecycle, potential AI-introduced security vulnerabilities, etc.)",

I did know exactly what to ask of it because the IT business partners who had discovered the flaw had basically written the tasks already. Anyway. AI worked well there.Where AI fails us is when we build new software to improve the business related to solar energy production and sale. It fails us because the tasks are never really well defined. Or even if they are, sometimes developers or engineers come up with a better way to do the business process than what was planned for. AI can write the code, but it doesn't refuse to write the code without first being told why it wouldn't be a better idea to do X first. If we only did code-reviews then we would miss that step.In a perfect organisation your BPM people would do this. In the world I live in there are virtually no BPM people, and those who know the processes are too busy to really deal with improving them. Hell... sometimes their processes are changed and they don't realize until their results are measurably better than they used to be. So I think it depends a lot on the situation.

From my experience, it takes a proficient developer to actually plan their code around future issues from separate processes.I think that it's mistaken to think that reasoning while writing the code is at all a good way to truly understand what your code is doing. (Without implying that you shouldn't write it by hand or reason about it.) You need to debug and test it thoroughly either way, and basically be as sceptical of your own output as you'd be of any other person's output.Thinking that writing the code makes you understand it better can cause more issues than thinking that even if you write the code, you don't really know what it's doing. You are merely typing out the code based on what you think it should be doing, and reasoning against that hypothesis. Of course, you can be better or worse at constructing the correct mental model from the get go, and keep updating it in the right direction while writing the code. But it's a slippery slope, because it can also go the other way around.A lot of bugs that take unreasonably long for junior-mid level engineers to find, seem to happen because: They trust their own mental model of the code too much without verifying it thoroughly, create a hypothesis for the bug in their own head without verifying it thoroughly, then get lost trying to reason about a made up version of whatever is causing the bug only to come to the conclusion that their original hypothesis was completely wrong.",

If inelegant code means more bugs that are harder to fix later, that translates into negative business value.That's a rather short-sighted opinion. Ask yourself how \"inelegant code\" find it's way into a codebase, even with working code review processes.The answer more often than not is what's typically referred to as tech debt driven development. Meaning, sometimes a hacky solution with glaring failure modes left unaddressed is all it takes to deliver a major feature in a short development cycle. Once the feature is out, it becomes less pressing to pay off that tech debt because the risk was already assumed and the business value was already created.Later you stumble upon a weird bug in your hacky solution. Is that bug negative business value?",

The US moon landing was contemporaneous with Whitey On The Moon. There are people who constantly care about things and work on incremental improvements to them that slowly collectively yield an outcome. That's just the mechanism that works.As an example, consider the Guinea Worm Eradication Program. In theory, sheer bloodymindedness and mass effort could have yielded the majority of the initial effects for great suppression. But the application of modern technology (and I include incentive system design in this category) brings the cost down sufficiently for successful eradication.Suppression of the disease is possible with old techniques: case maps, word of mouth reporting, logbooks. Now detection to containment is far faster because of digital technology. You can't just dump temephos on everything. You need to target application.The transmission of data specifically is a problem that most people discount the difficulty of. As an example that more people will be able to relate to, there was a delay in the October 2025 jobs report and it was finally released without an unemployment rate. Many people didn't get why it was hard.One viral tweet (mirrored by others) went:> Can't we just...> (rubs temples)> Can't we just divide the number of unemployed workers by the work force population? Isn't that the unemployment rate?But you don't know what those two numbers are. You need machinery to get it. The machinery has a lot of middle management. It cannot function without.Society today is a complex thing. To get insight into it you need a lot of infrastructure. The fact that we all have electric power, that roads across the country are reliable, that bridges are all up, that planes fly and trains run, is a marvel. It's a marvel enabled by all the bits that people work on, all the boring bits: yes, even procurement software. And yes, corporate law and bureaucracy. All of these things make this possible.I think a very common thing in online forums is to look at a flowering tree and say \"Oh, look at the flowers. They are so beautiful. Instead of such ugly bark and wood why don't we make more flowers?\". Building the society that has the muscle to do this is part of making things like this happen.",

So far with these edge database providers you don’t have a ton of say in how things are structured.

My team uses that kind of setup in all of our projects.> The interface isn't built with parallelism in mind, it's sort of bolted on but not really something I think could work well in practice.I'm curious about what this means. Could you expand on it?You might be interested in something like `treefmt`, which is designed around a standard interface for configuring formatters to run in parallel, but doesn't do any package management or installation at all:https://github.com/numtide/treefmt(That might address both of the issues I've replied to you about so far, to some extent.)> It also uses a bunch of rando open source repos which is a supply chain nightmare even with pinning.If the linters you're running are open source, isn't this what you're ultimately doing anyway?

This has the same configuration in the IDE, but sometimes devs ignore IDE warnings or just open files in a text editor for a quick edit and don't see IDE warnings or w/e.\"Replaced by CI\" isn't really meaningful in our context - pre-commit is just a tool that runs as part of CI - some things get done as pre-commit hooks because they're fast and it's a convenient place to put them. Devs are encouraged to also run pre-commit locally, but there's no enforcement of this.> Do you run tests? How do you know _which_ tests to run, and not just run every test CI would run, which could be slow?We have performance metrics for pre-commit hooks and pre-push hooks. I forget the exact numbers, but we want stuff to \"feel\" fast, so e.g. if you're rebasing something locally with a few dozen commits it should only take seconds.

Pedantic legalists insist that everyone couch their ideas in a rigid set of legal statutes.\"But you just said that an individual should be able to use copyrighted works. Therefore you should have no qualms with a legal individual (corp) utilizing every copyrighted work in the world to destroy society, as nothing they are doing is illegal under your rubric.\"The reality is most humans operate from a more natural and intuitive sense.  A single artist who made a song shouldn't be destroyed by the big corp that is stealing it for their own profit (e.g. Elastic vs. Amazon).  But its hard to interpret this in the strict legalist sense, because in the US, law is setup to make corps/people, money/speech, art/product, all hard to distinguish, and generally doesn't give much affordance to \"what the law reasonably meant\" when challenged by corporations (but it does seem to be applied quite conservatively for individuals).For example, data protection laws tend to be applied quite loosely to corps with slaps on the wrist and stern words.  For individuals, accessing data you shouldn't can mean the rest of your life in prison.  People feel this is unfair, but the legalists will use a bunch of reasoning to excuse the clear immorality.Its definitely \"using the intellect and words to override correct human moral intuitions.\"",

Copyright law is constructed by design for large institutions, lobbying, case law, and attendant legislation allow it to be abused by data hoarders. It was never built to protect individual creators or authors or artists, despite the PR campaigns and marketing for it.There are just companies big enough to ignore those institutions for which copyright law was created, like Google, etc, and the fair use exceptions Google carved out empowered AI companies to make similar moves. To an extent.What's hurting artists and smaller companies and various licensing schemes intended to push back is the fundamental structure of the laws.All copyrights need to be nuked and replaced. If we want to support individuals and maximize protections of individuals, and we want to disincentivize data hoarders that do nothing but recycle old content and IP in perpetual rent-seeking schemes, we should implement a 5 year copyright system.The first 5 years, you get total copyright, any commercial use has to be licensed explicitly, fair use remains largely as it is now. From year 6-10, fair use gets extended - you have to credit the creator, pay a 15% royalty direct to the creator, but otherwise you can use it for anything. Year 10-20, you must credit the creator, but otherwise the media is in the public domain.We should be pushing for and incentivizing creative use of data, empowering as many people as possible to use it and riff on it and make the culture vibrant and active and free from centralizing, manipulative actors.99% of commercial profits come from the first 5 years after any piece of media gets published - book, music, film, artwork, etc. Copyright should protect that, but after that 5 years, things open up so the price you pay in order to participate in the marketplace which the US fosters is that your content thereafter becomes available for use by anyone, and they have to pay a fair markup for the use. You don't get to deny anyone the use of the media. You'll get credited, paid, and then after 10 years, it's public domain + mandatory credits, kinda like an MIT license style. After 20 years, it's fully public domain.Throw in things like \"if you're not paid the royalty, you can sue for up to half of the total revenues generated by the offending work\" or something appropriately scaled to prohibit casual abuses, but not totally explode someone's life over honest mistakes, and scale between the two extremes accordingly.Things like Sony and Disney and Hollywood studios are evil. They're effectively data cartels and hoarders, rarely producing anything, gatekeeping access and socializing, imposing obscene contracts on naive artists and creators, exploiting everything and everyone they touch without returning concurrent value to society. They don't deserve consideration or protection under a sane copyright system, especially in a world with gigabit internet everywhere. Screw the MAFIAA and all the people responsible for things ending up like they have.Until then, pirate everything. If you feel an ethical obligation to pay, then do the research and send some crypto or a $20 bill in the mail to the author or creator. All sorts of people have crypto wallets, these days.",

          "content": "Hi HN,I built this because reverse engineering software across multiple versions is painful. You spend hours annotating functions in version 1.07, then version 1.08 drops and every address has shifted — all your work invisible.The core idea is a normalized function hashing system. It hashes functions by their logical structure — mnemonics, operand categories, control flow — not raw bytes or absolute addresses. When a binary is recompiled or rebased, the same function produces the same hash. All your documentation (names, types, comments) transfers automatically.Beyond that, it's a full MCP bridge with 110 tools for Ghidra: decompilation, disassembly, cross-referencing, annotation, batch analysis, and headless/Docker deployment. It integrates with Claude, Claude Code, or any MCP-compliant client.For context, the most popular Ghidra MCP server (LaurieWired's, 7K+ stars) has about 15 tools. This started as a fork of that project but grew into 28,600 lines of substantially different code.Architecture:  Java Ghidra Plugin (22K LOC) → embeds HTTP server inside Ghidra\n  Python MCP Bridge (6.5K LOC) → 110 tools with batch optimization\n  Any MCP client → Claude, scripts, CI pipelines\n\nI validated the hashing against Diablo II — dozens of patch versions, each rebuilding DLLs at different base addresses. The hash registry holds 154K+ entries, and I can propagate 1,300+ function annotations from one version to the next automatically.The headless mode runs in Docker (docker compose up) for batch processing and CI integration — no GUI required.v2.0.0 adds localhost-only binding (security), configurable timeouts, label deletion tools, and .env-based configuration.Happy to discuss the hashing approach, MCP protocol design decisions, or how this fits into modern RE workflows.",

With that sample size, have you encountered meaningful false positives where structurally similar but semantically different functions matched? The Version Tracker comparison in the comments is fair — seems like combining this hash approach with additional heuristics (xref patterns, call graph structure) could reduce both false positives and negatives.The headless Docker mode is a nice touch for CI integration. Being able to batch-analyze binaries and auto-propagate annotations without spinning up a GUI opens up some interesting automated diffing workflows.",

MOOLLM's cursor-mirror skill introspects Cursor's internals via a sister Python script that reads cursor's chat history and sqlite databases — tool calls, context assembly, thinking blocks, chat history.

I have more than 100 skills and had skill-snitch review each one including itself -- you can find them in the skill-snitch-report.md file of each skill in MOOLLM. Here is skill-snitch analyzing and reporting on itself, for example:skill-snitch's skill-snitch-report.md: https://github.com/SimHacker/moollm/blob/main/skills/skill-s...MOOLLM's thoughtful-commitment skill also composes with cursor-mirror to trace the reasoning behind git commits.thoughtful-commit skill: https://github.com/SimHacker/moollm/tree/main/skills/thought...MCP is still valuable for connecting to external systems.

We did spend a lot of time considering the issue of data consistency.In the MySQL replication, GTID is crucial for ensuring that no transaction is missed or replayed repeatedly. We handle this in two scenarios (depending on whether binlog is enabled):    - log_bin is OFF: We ensure that transaction in DuckDB are committed before the GTID is written to disk (in the mysql.gtid_executed table). Furthermore, after a crash recovery, we perform idempotent writes to DuckDB for a period of time (the principle is similar to upsert or delete+insert). Therefore, at any given moment after a crash recovery, we can guarantee that the data in DuckDB is consistent with the primary database.\n    - log_bin is ON: Unlike the previous scenario, we no longer rely on the `mysql.gtid_executed` table; we directly use the Binlog for GTID persistence. However, a new problem arises: Binlog persistence occurs before the Storage Engine commits. Therefore, we created a table in DuckDB to record the valid Binlog position. If the DuckDB transaction fails to commit, the Binlog will be truncated to the last valid position. This ensures that the data in DuckDB is consistent with the contents of the Binlog.\n\nTherefore, if the `gtid_executed` on the replica server matches that of the primary database, then the data in DuckDB will also be consistent with the primary database.",

In theory I really liked the idea: have Haiku wrangle small specific tasks that are tedious but routine and have Sonnet orchestrate everything. In practice the subagents took so many steps and wrote so much documentation that it became not worth it. Running 2-3 agents blew through the 5 hour quota in 20 minutes of work vs normal work where I might run out of quota 30-45 minutes before it resets. Even after tuning the subagent files to prevent them from writing tests I never asked for and not writing tons of documentation that I didn’t need they still produced way too much content and blew the context window of the main agent repeatedly.

The \"harness\" around that model will change as business-cost is tightened and the amount of context around the model is changed to improve the business case which generates the most money.Then there's the \"cataclysmic\" lockout cost where you accidently use the wrong tool that gets you locked out of the entire ecosystem and you are black listed, like a gambler in vegas who figures out how to count cards and it works until the house's accountant identifies you as a non-negligible customer cost.It's akin to anti-union arguments where everyone \"buying\" into the cloud AI circus thinks they're going to strike gold and completely ignores the fact that very few will and if they really wanted a better world and more control, they'd unionize and limit their illusions of grandeur. It should be an easy argument to make, but we're seeing about 1/3 of the population are extremely susceptible to greed based illusions.,",

Where attention/the exponential is key is when it selects out / needle-in-haystack / winner-takes-all focus (the word \"attention\" itself sorta implies this), and this is where the taylor expression would fail to represent the values well. This just... softens attentions ability to attend?(I'm imagining that if in the context there's ~4-8 \"similar\" attention-targets that should be sharp, and regular attention learns to select the correct one, this taylor approximation version would wash out any difference and they'd all loosly be attended to, and it'd fail to isolate the correct signal)Really wish this had some downstream tests -- apply it to a pretrained model and see how performance degrades, train a fresh one, etc. The tests are worth doing, but I somehow don't feel that hopeful this is the unlock required for sub-quadratic attention. It's possible that a freshly trained model with this learns to attend without the sharp attention signals, but that seems a bit dubious to me.But also, maybe this combined with some other selective (sparse attention) trick, means that the hybrid model gets the \"fuzzy long tail\" of attention well represented as well as the sharpness well represented, and all together it could actually be a part of the larger solution.",

The symmetry exploitation here reminds me of recent work connecting neural network training dynamics to renormalization group theory.\nCharles Martin's SETOL paper https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17912 shows that well-trained layers converge to something like an RG fixed point—the eigenvalue spectrum of the weight matrix develops power-law tails with exponent α ≈ 2, which is the signature of scale invariance. At this fixed point, the \"effective correlation space\" is low-dimensional: you can truncate the SVD aggressively and recover nearly identical test accuracy.I wonder if there's a connection to your Taylor truncation order. In RG terms, higher-order polynomial interactions are \"irrelevant operators\"—they get suppressed as you flow toward the fixed point. If trained attention heads are sitting near this fixed point, that might explain why modest truncation orders work: the network has already learned to concentrate its computation in the lower-order terms.\nA testable prediction: layers with α closer to 2 (measurable via weightwatcher https://github.com/CalculatedContent/WeightWatcher) might need fewer Taylor terms for accurate approximation than layers with α far from 2.

          "content": "I skimmed the paper, and I think I completely lost the plot.Sections 2.1 through 2.4 talk about the decomposing the per-token-pair attention (key vector from the ith token with query vector from the jth token, where, in inference, the jth token is the one being sampled) into an approximation that is only mildly outrageously exponential in size compared to the original exponential-of-a-dot product.  And they get something that's a polynomial (in the mathematical sense -- you're literally evaluating a polynomial) and has a size that's manageable at 4th order.Okay, great, they took something simple and made it bigger and nastier but less transcendental without losing too much precision.  (As far as I know, there is really nothing special about the exp in attention in the first place, so trying to approximate it well seems mostly useful insofar as it will keep existing models working.)But the reason that attention is quadratic is that each token gets evaluated with respect to each other token.  They haven't changed this at all.  Section 2.5 seems like it's deferring this to an appendix.  Section 2.6 gives the hidden state size per token, which, on first read, is strictly larger than the hidden state in normal attention (in normal attention it's d_v * d_k -- I'm not sure where their +1 comes from).So what did the paper gain?  Is there some detail that I missed or that the paper completely glossed over that explains why there is any gain of efficiency at all?For what it's worth, the paper's overall claim is, in some sense, impossible.  You can think of attention as being a sort of vector database, and this gets more accurate the sharper you make the exponential.  If you replace softmax with actual max, a query locates the key that is the closest match to the query and returns the associated value.  This operation is a plain linear search, it's possible (in principle anyway) to do lots of queries and recover the entire contents of the database, and I think that any paper claiming to do it faster than linear time should explain how it's compressing the data and where the loss is.In language model terms, imagine an prompt like so:    1: [string 1]\n    2: [string 2]\n    3: [string 3]\n    ...\n    n: [string n]\n    \n    Tell me the string associated with the number k.\n\nAs long as there's enough precision and enough query/key space to fit some embedding of the number k that will match the right thing (and there is a lot of  room in high-dimensional spaces), one might expect a transformer to be able to answer this question.  But this obviously requires memory with size linear in the prompt length.  If you try to get rid of that, you necessarily lose something.  (This is not to say that nice attention scaling is impossible -- one could imagine schemes where it takes the model multiple tokens to answer the question, and the number of tokens needed could scale, say, logarithmically with prompt size.  But you still need that linear memory.)",

Section 2.5 seems like it's deferring this to an appendix.They defer it to the appendix because it's a standard construction (Q'K)V = Q'(KV), where Q'K is an n×n matrix and requires O(n²) to compute, but KV has a constant size and can be computed in O(n) time, and the multiplication with Q' can also be done in O(n) time.> Section 2.6 gives the hidden state size per token, which, on first read, is strictly larger than the hidden state in normal attention (in normal attention it's d_v * d_k -- I'm not sure where their +1 comes from).Actually, their hidden state has a (large) constant size, so strike the words \"per token\" from section 2.6. In normal attention, the total state is n(d_v + d_k), but their state is basically (d_v + 1)D_k, where D_k is much larger than d_k, but independent of n. The +1 is because they also need to compute the normalization factor for the softmax.It's true that a constant state size implies that you cannot use it to losslessly store arbitrarily large databases, but LLMs in practice cannot do this either, so there's no loss of capability in that sense. (In fact, if you use enough terms in the Taylor expansion to get the same result as standard attention to within machine precision, the resulting constant state size should give you an upper bound for the amount of data the LLM can effectively retrieve from its context.)",

          "content": "Both, with caveats. The attention computation is fundamentally quadratic: for every token in the sequence, you're doing a computation that has to compute over every other token in the sequence. So it's O(N) per token, O(N^2) for the whole sequence.The big mitigation for this is that in causal transformers (i.e. all the chatbot type applications, where each token is only allowed to see tokens before it), you're running inference repeatedly on the same prefix in order to grow it by one token at a time. So if you cache the computations for tokens 0..N-1, on each inference pass you only have to compute O(N) for the newly added token at the end of the sequence.That's why caching (and caching charges) appear so prominently everywhere in the pricing of inference.In practice, caching is most beneficial at inference time, because you typically have relatively long conversations that start with the same cacheable prefix (the system prompt). At training time the same optimization can apply, but you're typically not pushing the same prefixes through the model repeatedly so you end up paying the quadratic cost more often.The quadratic cost of attention is the fundamental compute bottleneck for transformer architectures, which is why there's research like this trying to find shortcuts in computing attention, as well as research into completely new primitives to replace attention (e.g. SSM, which is O(N) on a cold cache and O(1) on a warm cache).",
