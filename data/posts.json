      "abstract": "该讨论围绕“太空数据中心是否可行”展开，核心争议在于技术可行性与实际效益。多数用户对太空数据中心的散热问题表示质疑，认为太空接近真空，散热只能依赖辐射，效率远低于地球，且需要巨大的散热器，这在工程上可能不切实际。同时，有用户指出能源供应是另一大障碍，太空太阳能板发电量有限，难以支撑耗电巨大的AI数据中心。\n\n讨论中也存在不同视角。有用户引用欧盟研究，认为太空数据中心可能在2036年前实现，提供了相对乐观的技术展望。另有观点认为，讨论过于聚焦美国，而卫星互联网可能是弥补地面宽带不足的替代方案，并非完全不合理。此外，部分用户将太空数据中心视为科幻概念的衍生，质疑其现实动机。\n\n共识方面，社区普遍认为当前技术条件下，太空数据中心面临严重的散热和能源挑战，大规模部署缺乏可行性。分歧则体现在对长期技术发展的判断上，一方坚持物理限制难以突破，另一方则认为随着技术进步，未来或许存在可能性。",

A satellite is, if nothing else, a fantastic thermos.  A data center in space would necessarily rely completely on cooling by radiation, unlike a terrestrial data center that can make use of convection and conduction. You can't just pipe heat out into the atmosphere or build a heat exchanger. You can't exchange heat with vacuum.  You can only radiate heat into it.Heat is going to limit the compute that can be done in a satellite data centre and radiative cooling solutions are going to massively increase weight. It makes far more sense to build data centers in the arctic.Musk is up to something here.  This could be another hyperloop (i.e. A distracting promise meant to sabotage competition).  It could be a legal dodge.  It could be a power grab.  What it will not be is a useful source of computing power.  Anyone who takes this venture seriously is probably going to be burned.",

Most of advertised savings come not from placing the data centre in space, but the fact that advocates have argued away the need for absolutely everything that modern data centres are designed to supply, except for the compute.If they can really build a space data centre satellite for as cheap as they claim, why launch it? Just drive it out into the middle of the desert and dump it there. It can access the internet via starlink, and already has solar panels for power and radiators for cooling. IMO, If it can cool itself in direct sunlight in space, it can cool itself in the desert.The main thing that space gains you over setting up the same satellite in the desert is ~23 hours of power, vs the ~12 hours of power on the ground. And you suddenly gain the ability to repair the satellite. The cost of the launch would have to be extremely cheap before the extra 11ish hours of runtime per day outweighed the cost of a launch; Just build twice as many \"ground satellites\".And that's with a space optimised design. We can gain even more cost savings by designing proper distributed datacenter elements. You don't need lightweight materials, just use steel. You can get rid of the large radiators and become more reliant on air cooling. You can built each element bigger, because you don't have to fit the rocket dimensions. You could even add a wind turbine, so your daily runtime isn't dependant on daylight hours. Might even be worth getting rid of solar and optimising for wind power instead.An actual ground optimised design should be able to deliver the same functionality as the space data centre, for much cheaper costs. And it's this ground optimised distributed design that space data centres should be compared to, not today's datacenter which are hyper-optimised for pre-AI use cases.-------------------Space data centres are nothing more than a cool Sci-Fi solution looking for a problem. There have been mumblings for years, but they were never viable (even bitcoin mining was a bit too latency sensitive). Space data centre advocates have been handed a massive win with this recent AI boom, it's the perfect problem for their favourite solution to solve.But because it's a solution looking for a problem, they are completely blind to other solutions that might be an even better fit.",

Also at least if you are bulk buying Nvidea GPGPUs on single digit Million Euro basis it's not rare that 30% have some level of defect. Not necessary \"fully broken\" but \"performs less good then it should/compared to other units\" kind of broken.4. radiation/solar wind protections are a huge problem. Heck even if you run things on earth it's a problem as long as your operations scale is large enough. In space things are magnitudes worse.5. every rocket lunch causes atmospheric damage, so does every satellite evaporating on re-entry. That wasn't that relevant in the past, but might become a problem just for keeping stuff like Starlink running. We don't need to make it worse by putting datacenters into space.6. Kessler Syndrom is real and could seriously hurt humanity as a whole, no reason to make it much more likely by putting things into space which don't need to go there.Last but not least, wtf would you even want to do it?There is zero benefit, non nada.",

          "content": "The crux of it is that radiative cooling in space is dependent on exposed surface, not total surface area like a radiator or heatsink on earth - this means if you just put an existing finned heatsink in space it would radiate most of it's heat back to itself - the only net cooling you'd have is the amount that can radiate outwards without hitting itself.For a benchmark - the IIS uses about 4500sqft (420 sqm) of radiators just to keep it's onboard equipment (~70KW) cooled.  That's ~150-200 W/sqm.That means, per GPU, you'd need about 2.5-3.0 sqm of passive radiators.For a 1MW satellite (~8 datacenter racks of GB200/NVL72) you'd need basically half a football field of bleeding-edge solar panels (that also need to radiate their heat on the reverse side) and a similar sized cooling array of heat radiators for the electronics.This is on the scale of 40-50 tons - about 10% of the IIS.  This should fit on falcon heavy or starship - assuming the solar array and radiators can fold up to fit inside.  You could, purely based on weight, launch 2 of these per starship launch.If you consider the Opex savings (electricity, rent, facilities maintenance) and putting 2 of these on a single starship launch, I still think the ROI would be too long.  You're saving about ~$1M per year in Opex but it's costing you $25M to launch it into space and likely an extra ~$50M in satellite equipment (based on starlink satellite costs) on top of the compute.  Will those GPUs still be useful in 10 years? Probably not.I don't think the math is there that justifies the free electricity - even at gigawatt scale (thousands of satellites mass-produced) and at a dramatically lower cost per satellite and per launch.  Getting costs down on this would involve tightly integrating the compute and the satellite hardware which would make upgrading the compute independently from the cooling/power infrastructure in the future a significant challenge.",

To achieve this, Starcloud is developing a lightweight deployable radiator design with a very large area - by far the largest radiators deployed in space - radiating primarily towards deep space...They claim they can radiate \"633.08 W / m^2\". At that rate, they're looking at square kilometers of radiators to dissipate gigawatts of thermal load, perhaps hectares of radiators.They also claim that they can \"dramatically increase\" heat dissipation with heat pumps.So, there you have it: \"all you have to do\" is deploy a few hectares of radiators in space, combined with heat pumps that can dissipate gigawatts of thermal load with no maintenance at all over a lifetime of decades.This seems like the sort of \"not technically impossible\" problem that can attract a large amount of VC funding, as VCs buy lottery tickets that the problem can be solved.",

It's like you point out a number of completely obvious problems with the scheme and immediately, without any detailed analysis or expertise (I know this, because surely you can't have expertise in all of the problems you cited) in the said problems, claim that they are completely impossible for anyone to ever solve.> 1. every gram you need to send to space is costly, a issue you don't have at ground levelThis is a one time cost. Maybe the running costs are cheap enough to offset this.> 2. cooling is a catastrophe, sure space is cold, but also a vacuum, so the cooling rate is roughly the infrared radiation rate. This means if you are not careful with the surface of a satellite it can end up being very slowly cooked by sunlight alone not including running any higher heat producing component (as it absorbs more heat from sunlight then it emits, there is a reason satellites are mostly white, silver or reflective gold in color). Sure better surface materials fix that, but not to a point where you would want to run any heavy compute on it.I would assume the people designing this are \"very careful\" with everything they put in the data center. If achieving the cooling is only very hard and requires careful material engineering, then it can be worked out and they will get it done. If it is impossible, then this will not happen, but I'm a physicist myself and I can't tell without a very involved analysis whether it is impossible or not to get enough cooling power for this in space, considering all, possibly ingenious ways to engineer the surfaces of the data center to dissipate a maximum amount of heat.> 3. zero repair-ability, most long running satellites have a lot of redundancy. Also at least if you are bulk buying Nvidea GPGPUs on single digit Million Euro basis it's not rare that 30% have some level of defect. Not necessary \"fully broken\" but \"performs less good then it should/compared to other units\" kind of broken.I suppose they could make something like the International Space Station, which would get regular traffic back-and-forth exchanging and servicing hardware as needed.> 4. radiation/solar wind protections are a huge problem. Heck even if you run things on earth it's a problem as long as your operations scale is large enough. In space things are magnitudes worse.Again, it's not a question whether this is \"problematic\"; everything about putting data centers in space is. The question is whether, with huge amount of work and resources, they can engineer a solution to overcome this. If they can, it's again a one time cost for the data center that might be offset by the running costs of the facility.> 5. every rocket lunch causes atmospheric damage, so does every satellite evaporating on re-entry. That wasn't that relevant in the past, but might become a problem just for keeping stuff like Starlink running. We don't need to make it worse by putting datacenters into space.> 6. Kessler Syndrom is real and could seriously hurt humanity as a whole, no reason to make it much more likely by putting things into space which don't need to go there.These are collective problems for the whole of humanity and will not concern an individual actor such as Elon Musk who wants to send more satellites into space.",

It is not a car company stock, it is an elon vibes check).The thing he's saying now pattern matches to be pretty similar, and so given Musk's goal is to gain money, and he gains money by TSLA and SpaceX stock going up, this makes perfect sense as a thing to say and even make minor motions towards in order to make him richer.People will support it too since it pattern matches with the thing prior TSLA holders got rich off of, and so people will want to keep the musk vibes high so that their own $tsla holdings go to the moon.Make sense now?",

They all boil down to needing a lot of mass to radiate heat out to the universe and ways to conduct heat. We've been doing that at small scale for decades. SpaceX is already operating a fleet of many thousands of satellites that they built and engineered. They'd be well familiar with this challenge.Once you have solutions, it turns into a cost problem. And if that cost is too high (for whatever arbitrary threshold you use for that) it becomes an optimization problem.This whole thread reads like a lot of \"but ... but ... but ...\". It all boils down to people assuming things about what is too much or too hard. And it's all meaningless unless you actually bother to articulate those assumptions. What exactly is too hard here? What would it take to address those issues? What would the cost be? Put some numbers on it. There are also all sorts of assumptions about what is valuable and what isn't. You can't say something is too hard or too costly without making assertions about what is worth paying for and what isn't.The answers are going to be boring. We need X amounts of giga tons launched to orbit at Y amount of dollars. OK great. What happens if launch cost drops by 1 or 2 orders of magnitude? What happens if the amount of mass needed drops because of some engineering innovation? Massively dropping launch cost is roughly what SpaceX is proposing to do with Star Ship. Is it still \"too hard\"? You can't have that debate until you put numbers on your assertions.There's a bit of back of the envelope math involved here but we're roughly talking about a million satellites. In the order of ~2.5 million tonnes of mass (at 2.5 ton per satellite). Tens of thousands of Star Ship launches basically. It's definitely a big project. We're talking about 1-2 order magnitude increase of the scale of operations for SpaceX going from lower hundreds to thousands of launches per year spread over maybe 10-15 years to work up to a million satellites.I'm more worried about what all that mass is going to do when it burns up in the atmosphere / drops in the oceans.

Reducing the cost of launches is great, but it will never be as cheap as zero launches.2. Radio transmissions have equally high bandwidth from Earth, but fiber is a better network backbone in almost every way.3. Radiation events don't only cause unpredictable data errors, they can also cause circuit latch-ups and cascade into system failure. Error-free operation is still better in any case. Earth's magenetosphere and atmosphere give you radiation shielding for free, rad-hard chips will always cost more than standard (do they even exist for this application?), and extra shielding will always cost more than no shielding.4. On Earth you can use conduction, convection, AND radiation for cooling. Space only gets you marginally more effective radiation.5. Solar is cheaper on the ground than in space. The increase in solar collection capability per unit area in space doesn't offset the cost of launch: you can get 20kW of terrestrial solar collection for around the price of a single 1U satellite launch, and that solar production can be used on upgraded equipment in the future. Any solar you put on a satellite gets decommissioned when the inference hardware is obsolete.And this ignores other issues like hardware upgrades, troubleshooting, repairs, and recycling that are essentially impossible in space, but are trivial on the ground.",

I print grip and grip attachments for my 9mms and my AR15, trigger guards, barrel clamps, etc. I also find it stupid since, as the article suggests, what kind of algorithm can you implement to do smart detection of something that could be potentially dangerous? Will it also detect negative space? I print inserts in elastic filament with my gun outlines instead of foam (or as foam templates) for my carrying cases. Will the \"algorithm\" prevent me to do that too? What about my plastic disc thrower toy gun, or my PKD Blaster prop? Both look like guns to me. What about a dumb AI algorithm that lacks common sense?Printing barrels and FCUs -- the fire control unit, which is the only thing tracked and serialized in a gun at least in the US -- is more difficult but not impossible. Actually, building a functional FCU that can strike a bullet primer, or a barrel that can be used once is not difficult at all and if you look around you can find videos of people that have tested that with a mixture of 3d printing and rudimentary metal working skills. The major issues on designing those parts are reliability and safety. In the Philippines there is a full bootleg gunsmith industry dedicated to build illegal guns that match commercial ones in those aspects too.Sadly, instead of having better laws we get fallacy rhetoric by people who probably have never touched, much less fired a gun in their lives.",

And if a manufacturer is giving me models for it, they probably do so with the explicit expectation that I might end up using them to manufacture a replacement.In most cases either me or some other volunteer will need to measure the existing part, write down all the critical measurements, and then design a new part from scratch in CAD.Even if somehow you are able to fingerprint on those critical measurements, that's just _one_ part.The only way this kind of nonsense law could work is if you mandate that 3D printers must not accept commands from an untrusted source (signature verification) and then you must have software which uses a database to check for such critical measurements, ideally _before_ slicing.Except that still doesn't work because I can always post-process a part to fit.And it doesn't work even more because the software will need to contain a signing key. Unless the signing key is on a remote server somewhere to which you must send your model for validation.This is never going to work, or scale.There are even more hurdles...

So it isn't about detecting exact shapes, it's about preventing printing of STL files that are already known to be dangerous. This would make it harder to illegally manufacture parts for weapons because it would make it much harder to share designs. If you didn't have the knowledge or skill to design a reliable FCU, you would have to find a design someone with that knowledge and skill created - which the printer could theoretically detect with a cryptographic signature.As the original author of the post pointed out though, this could and would be bypassed by actual criminals.

It’s very plausible (and increasingly likely) that OpenAI/Anthropic are profitable on a per-token marginal basis, especially given how cheap equivalent open-weight inference has become. Third-party providers are effectively price-discovering the floor for inference.Second: model lifecycle economics. Training costs are lumpy, front-loaded, and hard to amortize cleanly. Even if inference margins are positive today, the question is whether those margins are sufficient to pay off the training run before the model is obsoleted by the next release. That’s a very different problem than “are they losing money per request”.Both sides here can be right at the same time: inference can be profitable, while the overall model program is still underwater.

You'll note the similar sized model is often much cheaper than what anthropic/openai provide.Example: Let's compare claude 4 models with deepseek. Claude 4 is ~400B params so it's best to compare with something like deepseek V3 which is 680B params.Even if we compare the cheapest claude model to the most expensive deepseek provider we have claude charging $1/M for input and $5/M for output, while deepseek providers charge $0.4/M and $1.2/M, a fifth of the price, you can get it as cheap as $.27 input $0.4 output.As you can see, even if we skew things overly in favor of claude, the story is clear, claude token prices are much higher than they could've been. The difference in prices is because anthropic also needs to pay for training costs, while openrouter providers just need to worry on making serving models profitable. Deepseek is also not as capable as claude which also puts down pressure on the prices.There's still a chance that anthropic/openai models are losing money on inference, if for example they're somehow much larger than expected, the 400B param number is not official, just speculative from how it performs, this is only taking into account API prices, subscriptions and free user will of course skew the real profitability numbers, etc.Price sources:https://openrouter.ai/deepseek/deepseek-v3.2-specialehttps://claude.com/pricing#api",

That's precisely what the investment money is for.However I don't think using their API and paying for tokens has negative value for the company. We can compare to models like DeepSeek where providers can charge a fraction of the price of OpenAI tokens and still be profitable.

The SAPs of the world have nothing to fear, companies aren't going to vibe code a CRM, but they are going to be able to more easily write integrations. At a previous job we frequently had bills for €10.000 for small integrations into our ERP, but once we figured out the API and gained more confidence in our abilities, all those integrations got pulled in house.If your SaaS platform provides actual benefits, then you don't need to worry. If your business in writing integrations for other companies into platforms you don't own, yes, AI is going to hurt your business.This should have happened regardless of AI though. The idea that companies (over a certain size, e.g. ~20 people) doesn't have a least on developer employed, regardless of industry always seemed like a missed business opportunity. We wrote so many tools for sales, warehousing, customer service and accounting and it's hard to imagine the business functioning without those tools.

The invention of SQL was supposed to eliminate roles like Report Writer and Data Analyst because now business people could just write their own queries \"in English\" and get back answers.And yet, precisely that happened in the end, just not with the tools envisioned. Excel, VBA and, where you had one knowledgeable employee, MS Access makes for incredibly powerful and incredibly hard to maintain \"shadow IT\" - and made even more difficult when someone sneaked in a password, because that takes a bit of an effort to remove [1], knowledge that is easy for us today to find, but not when I was young.Also, back in the IE6 era, there was a lot of point-and-click created web interfaces... just that it wasn't HTML5 or even HTML. It was an <object> tag loading some ActiveX written by some intern in VB6, or Java, or Flash. I sort of miss that era but also, it was a damn security nightmare. Flash with its constant stream of security vulnerabilities was ripe for exploits, but at least it didn't run native code with full user privileges by design. I'm not kidding, theoretically you could go and import/use functions from any system DLL up to and including Kernel32.

The ORM worked for all the happy path and written down cases but then you have cases were the ORM just is not good enough or fast. So you start to add strange code to work around the ORM. The same for the web framework or the validation lib.To me the author of this comment sounds like the typical \"Freelancer\" coming in into a company knowing everything better then all the people and then leaving after a few months and now everybody else has to deal with his code.",

When I was a newly joined Google consultant at a partner firm, we went to their office - some 13 different types of cuisines, different types of game rooms, lounges and what not. A luxury star hotel experience. We were waiting for our meeting on behalf of this one particularly large media client who was bleeding money on Wordpress.3 engineers arrived - fashionably late. We explained them the situation and all we wanted from them was some GCP offering that would cure our woes and one that would cut our bills. The senior consultant - and presumably the only tech guy (rest seemed to be salesy) wasted our time like a used car salesman - he didn't even understand Google's own product portfolio and recommended us to use something like Spanner - which was totally not the solution to the problem, not to mention, expensive.My boss and I left the meeting pissed off and he told me - \"Neya, you probably know more about the product portfolio than these guys. Let's leave\". That weekend, I went with my tried and trusted favorite Db - PostgreSQL - CloudSQL with a custom Elixir middleware based an old CMS I wrote a decade ago. After some trial and error, the solution worked flawlessly (and still does till date on auto-pilot). My client still has the lowest cost in the region - 1/3rd the cost of their competitors...7 years later. Back then, there was no vibe-coding, no AI, no auto-completion. Just pure thinking and experimentation.All this just to say I agree that the new guy sometimes can make the best solutions to a problem and not always screw up. I always listen to new hires these days (now I'm a fractional / CTO) because you never know who could pull off that 1/3rd cost cutting framework move.",

Owning is at one end of the spectrum, with cloud at the other, and a broadly couple of options in-between:1 - Cloud – This is minimising cap-ex, hiring, and risk, while largely maximising operational costs (its expensive) and cost variability (usage based).2 - Managed Private Cloud - What we do. Still minimal-to-no cap-ex, hiring, risk, and medium-sized operational cost (around 50% cheaper than AWS et al). We rent or colocate bare metal, manage it for you, handle software deployments, deploy only open-source, etc. Only really makes sense above €$5k/month spend.3 - Rented Bare Metal – Let someone else handle the hardware financing for you. Still minimal cap-ex, but with greater hiring/skilling and risk. Around 90% cheaper than AWS et al (plus time).4 - Buy and colocate the hardware yourself – Certainly the cheapest option if you have the skills, scale, cap-ex, and if you plan to run the servers for at least 3-5 years.A good provider for option 3 is someone like Hetzner. Their internal ROI on server hardware seems to be around the 3 year mark. After which I assume it is either still running with a client, or goes into their server auction system.Options 3 & 4 generally become more appealing either at scale, or when infrastructure is part of the core business.

          "content": ">San Diego has a mild climate and we opted for pure outside air cooling. This gives us less control of the temperature and humidity, but uses only a couple dozen kW. We have dual 48” intake fans and dual 48” exhaust fans to keep the air cool. To ensure low humidity (<45%) we use recirculating fans to mix hot exhaust air with the intake air. One server is connected to several sensors and runs a PID loop to control the fans to optimize the temperature and humidity.Oh man, this is bad advice.  Airborn humidity and contaminants will KILL your servers on a very short horizon in most places - even San Diego.   I highly suggest enthalpy wheel coolers (kyotocooling is one vendor - switch datacenters runs very similar units on their massive datacenters in the Nevada desert) as they remove the heat from the indoor air using outdoor air (+can boost slightly with an integrated refrigeration unit to hit target intake temps) without switching the air from one side to the other.  This has huge benefits for air control quality and outdoor air tolerance and a single 500KW heat rejection unit uses only 25KW of input power (when it needs to boost the AC unit's output).  You can combine this with evaporative cooling on the exterior intakes to lower the temps even further at the expense of some water consumption (typically far cheaper than the extra electricity to boost the cooling through an hvac cycle).Not knocking the achievement just speaking from experience that taking outdoor air (even filtered + mixed) into a datacenter is a recipe for hardware failure and the mean time to failure for that is highly dependant on your outdoor air conditions.  I've run 3MW facilities with passive air cooling and taking outdoor air directly into servers requires a LOT more conditioning and consideration than is outlined in this article.",

Which means it doesn't make much sense for the majority of startup companies until they become late stage and their hosting cost actually becomes a big cost burden.There are in between solutions. Renting bare metal instead of renting virtual machines can be quite nice. I've done that via Hetzner some years ago. You pay just about the same but you get a lot more performance for the same money. This is great if you actually need that performance.People obsess about hardware but there's also the software side to consider. For smaller companies, operations/devops people are usually more expensive than the resources they manage. The cost to optimize is that cost. The hosting cost usually is a rounding error on the staffing cost. And on top of that the amount of responsibilities increases as soon as you own the hardware. You need to service it, monitor it, replace it when it fails, make sure those fans don't get jammed by dust puppies, deal with outages when they happen, etc. All the stuff that you pay cloud providers to do for you now becomes your problem. And it has a non zero cost.The right mindset for hosting cost is to think of it in FTEs (full time employee cost for a year). If it's below 1 (most startups until they are well into scale up territory), you are doing great. Most of the optimizations you are going to get are going to cost you in actual FTEs spent doing that work. 1 FTE pays for quite a bit of hosting. Think 10K per month in AWS cost. A good ops person/developer is more expensive than that. My company runs at about 1K per month (GCP and misc managed services). It would be the wrong thing to optimize for us. It's not worth spending any amount of time on for me. I literally have more valuable things to do.This flips when you start getting into the multiple FTEs per month in cost for just the hosting. At that point you probably have additional cost measured in 5-10 FTE in staffing anyway to babysit all of that. So now you can talk about trading off some hosting FTEs for modest amount of extra staffing FTEs and make net gains.",

If you're using something like ECS or serverless, AWS gains nothing by optimizing the servers to make your code run faster - their hard work results in less billed infrastructure hours.This 'microservices' push usually means that instead of having an on-server session where you can serve stuff from a temporary cache, all the data that persists between requests needs to be stored in a db somewhere, all the auth logic needs to re-check your credentials, and something needs to direct the traffic and load balance these endpoint, and all this stuff costs money.I think if you have 4 Java boxes as servers with a redundant DB with read replicas on EC2, your infra is so efficient and cheap that even paying 4x for it rather than going for colocation is well worth it because of the QoL and QoS.These crazy AWS bills usually come from using every service under the sun.",

I can’t remember a time when Hacker News comments leaned pro-cloud because it’s always been about self-hosting.The few times the on-prem people won out in my career never went exactly as they imagined. Buying a couple servers and setting them up at the colo is easy enough, but the slow and steady drag of maintaining your own infrastructure starts to work its way into every development cycle after that. In my experience, every team has significantly underestimated how all the little things add up to a drag on available time for other work.The best case for on-prem that I saw was when a company was basically in maintenance mode. Engineers had a lot of extra time to optimize, update. maintain, and cost reduce without subtracting from feature development or bug fixes.The worst cases for on-prem I’ve seen have been funded startups. In this situation it’s imperative that everyone focus on feature development and rapid iteration. Letting some of the engineers get sidetracked with setting up and maintaining their own hosting to save a dollar amount that barely hires 1-2 more engineers but sets the schedule back by many months was a huge mistake.In my experience, most engineers become less enchanted with rolling their own on premises hosting as they get older. Their work becomes more about getting the job done quickly and to budget, not hyper-optimizing the hosting situation at the expense of inviting more complexity and miscellaneous tasks into their workload.",

You want to be on the midpoint between those and 16'C/65'f temps & -12'C/10'f dew point to have no impact on server longevity or MTBF rates.As a recent example:  KCASANDI6112 - January 2, 2026\n\n                 High         Low      Average\n\n  Temperature    73.4 °F   59.9 °F      63.5 °F\n\n  Dew Point      68.0 °F   60.0 °F      62.6 °F\n\n  Humidity       99 %      81 %         96 %\n\n  Precipitation  0.12 in   --           --\n\nLastly, air contaminants - in the form of dust (that can be filtered out) and chemicals (which can't without extensive scrubbing) are probably the most detrimental to server equipment if not properly managed, and require very intentional and frequent filter changes (typically high MERV pleated filters changed on a time or pressure drop signal) to prevent server degradation and equipment risks.The last consideration is fire suppression - permitted datacenters usually require compliance with separate fire code, such that direct outdoor air exchange without active shutdown and dry suppression is not permitted - this is to prevent a scenario where your equipment catches on fire and a constant supply of fresh oxygen-rich outdoor air turns that into an inferno.  Smoke detection systems don't operate well with outdoor-mixed air or any level of airborn particulates.So - for those reasons - among a few others - open air datacenters are not recommended unless you're doing them at google or meta scale, and in those scenarios you typically have much more extensive systems and purpose-designed hardware in order to operate for the design life of the equipment without issues.",

          "content": ",,GPT‑5.3-Codex is the first model we classify as High capability  for cybersecurity-related tasks under our Preparedness Framework , and the first we’ve directly trained to identify software vulnerabilities. While we don’t have definitive evidence it can automate cyber attacks end-to-end, we’re taking a precautionary approach and deploying our most comprehensive cybersecurity safety stack to date. Our mitigations include safety training, automated monitoring, trusted access for advanced capabilities, and enforcement pipelines including threat intelligence.''While I love Codex and believe it's amazing tool, I believe their preparedness framework is out of date. As it is more and more capable of vibe coding complex apps, it's getting clear that the main security issues will come up by having more and more security critical software vibe coded.It's great to look at systems written by humans and how well Codex can be used against software written by humans, but it's getting more important to measure the opposite: how well humans (or their own software) are able to infiltrate complex systems written mostly by Codex, and get better on that scale.In simpler terms: Codex should write secure software by default.",

Accounting as a profession grew, becoming far more analytical/strategic than it had been previously.You are correct that these models primarily address problems that have already been solved. However, that has always been the case for the majority of technical challenges. Before LLMs, we would often spend days searching Stack Overflow to find and adapt the right solution.Another way to look at this is through the lens of problem decomposition as well. If a complex problem is a collection of sub-problems, receiving immediate solutions for those components accelerates the path to the final result.For example, I was recently struggling with a UI feature where I wanted cards to follow a fan-like arc. I couldn't quite get the implementation right until I gave it to Gemini. It didn't solve the entire problem for me, but it suggested an approach involving polar coordinates and sine/cosine values. I was able to take that foundational logic turn it into a feature I wanted.Was it a 100x productivity gain? No. But it was easily a 2x gain, because it replaced hours of searching and waiting for a mental breakthrough with immediate direction.There was also a relevant thread on Hacker News recently regarding \"vibe coding\":https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45205232The developer created a unique game using scroll behavior as the primary input.

A few things that make it pretty impressive:> This was a clean-room implementation (Claude did not have internet access at any point during its development); it depends only on the Rust standard library. The 100,000-line compiler can build Linux 6.9 on x86, ARM, and RISC-V. It can also compile QEMU, FFmpeg, SQlite, postgres, redis>  I started by drafting what I wanted: a from-scratch optimizing compiler with no dependencies, GCC-compatible, able to compile the Linux kernel, and designed to support multiple backends. While I specified some aspects of the design (e.g., that it should have an SSA IR to enable multiple optimization passes) I did not go into any detail on how to do so.> Previous Opus 4 models were barely capable of producing a functional compiler. Opus 4.5 was the first to cross a threshold that allowed it to produce a functional compiler which could pass large test suites, but it was still incapable of compiling any real large projects.And the very open points about limitations (and hacks, as cc loves hacks):> It lacks the 16-bit x86 compiler that is necessary to boot [...] Opus was unable to implement a 16-bit x86 code generator needed to boot into 16-bit real mode. While the compiler can output correct 16-bit x86 via the 66/67 opcode prefixes, the resulting compiled output is over 60kb, far exceeding the 32k code limit enforced by Linux. Instead, Claude simply cheats here and calls out to GCC for this phase> It does not have its own assembler and linker;> Even with all optimizations enabled, it outputs less efficient code than GCC with all optimizations disabled.Ending with a very down to earth take:> The resulting compiler has nearly reached the limits of Opus’s abilities. I tried (hard!) to fix several of the above limitations but wasn’t fully successful. New features and bugfixes frequently broke existing functionality.All in all, I'd say it's a cool little experiment, impressive even with the limitations, and a good test-case as the author says \"The resulting compiler has nearly reached the limits of Opus’s abilities\".

      "abstract": "该帖子讨论了硬件初创者首次生产500件产品的经验教训。核心话题围绕硬件制造，特别是与中国供应链合作的挑战和注意事项。有人认为中国制造商倾向于以最低成本完成未明确指定的环节，导致产品质量问题，并举了遥控车虽性能出色却因微小成本节约而快速损坏的例子。也有用户指出，这体现了SaaS投资者对硬件创业商业模式差异的缺乏理解。讨论中提到寻找可靠工厂是主要难题之一，有用户询问作者如何找到可信工厂并建立合作。此外，部分用户对产品本身（如高流明灯具的功耗和定价）表达了兴趣和疑虑，其中一人提到关税政策变化对硬件成本的影响可能被低估。整体上，社区认同硬件创业涉及独特的供应链管理挑战，尤其在质量控制与成本平衡方面存在普遍困难，但对于如何有效应对这些挑战以及具体产品设计则存在不同看法。",

          "content": "This is the second article about hardware supply from China I've read and it reads very much the same, albiet in a different niche (the other one was about SBC construction) -Anything you don't specify will be done least cost, and there is no amount of \"least\" which cannot be chased in manufacture.The other one noted if you don't specify the density of plastic for bags, or paper for bags and packing, you get clingfilm thinner than you thought existed, and paper which is almost tissue in its weakness. You don't even get boxes to put the boxes in, if you don't specify boxes to be delivered in boxes. So now wrapping a pallet becomes a nightmare if they don't stack. And if you don't specify how many to stack, and how to pad the stack, they won't do unit height stacking if it costs labour time. Your risk.Some of this like the casting mistake, or the knob thing, could happen anywhere and you have to be close to final manufacture spec to find out e.g. the metal coating impinges on the knob at the free space you specified, because your test rig didn't have powder coating. Or, that a design feature you need like the light entry holes, is used by the casting engineer as pour points because it looked like you'd specified mould pour points not functional holes.But other things like \"yea, you didn't spec how long to make the tails so we cut the tails as close as we could\" is just the cheapening above: if you don't SAY its a 10cm tail for the connector, it will be 2cm, if saving 8cm of cable saves money for them.I've read some stuff which says the cost of 5 SBC boards with pre-applied SMD is now so low, you might as well order 5 so you get at least 1 which works. That means they will wind up working out your tolerance for failure, and produce goods to meet that: if 1 in 5 is viable, thats what they'll target.",

They take an aggressive approach—counting cameras and maintaining a Discord channel where they discuss potential activities to move against surveillance expansion and stop organizations like Flock. What's your perspective on this organization and their methods?FLOCK CEO: I see two distinct groups of activists here. There are organizations like the ACLU and the EFF that take an above-board approach to fighting for their viewpoint. We're fortunate to live in a democratic, capitalistic country where we can fight through the courts. I have a lot of respect for those groups because they engage in reasonable debate while following the law.FLOCK CEO: Unfortunately, there are also what I'd call terroristic organizations like Deflock, whose primary motivation appears to be chaos. They're closer to Antifa than anything else. That's disappointing because I don't want chaos - I value law and order and a society built on safety.FLOCK CEO: For those groups, I think it's regrettable they haven't chosen a more constructive approach to achieve their goals. They do have the right to their views, but that's why we have a democratically elected process. We're not forcing Flock on anyone. Elected officials understand that communities and families want safety, and Flock is the best way to create safe communities.INTERVIEWER: Deflock probably wouldn't agree with the \"terroristic\" label you've applied to them, but...----Yeah. \"They have a right to their views\" buuut also, they are terrorists, and implicitly therefore deserve to have their freedom taken away because of said views. So giving the public a map of flock cameras and organizing to advocate against these being used in our communities is terroristic, I suppose. There's one party here that should be in jail here.

On the surface there's nothing wrong with doing that but that just seems to be the ONLY thing Microsoft is focused on.Worse yet, most of these integrations seem like a exercise in ticking boxes rather than actually thinking through how integrating Copilot into a product will actually improve user experience. A great example was someone mentioned that Copilot was now integrated into the terminal app but beyond an icon + a chat window, there is zero integration.Overall, MS just reeks of an organization that is cares more about numbers on a dashboard and pretty reports than they are on what users are actually experiencing.",

With a 1,000,000:1 ratio of users to developers and an operating expense (OpEx) of engineers/offices/management. That works as a business.But with \"AI\", not only is it not a product in itself, it's a feature to a product, but it has OpEx and CapEx costs that dominate the balance sheet based on their public disclosures. Worse, as a feature, it demonstrably harms business with its hallucinations.In a normal world, at this point companies would say, \"hmm, well we thought it could be amazing but it just doesn't work as a product or a feature of a product because we can't sell it for enough money to both cover its operation, and its development, and the capital expenditures we need to make every time someone signs up.

Once the code was written, it was all profit. You’d have some level of maintenance and new features, but really - the cost of sale was super low.In the Internet age (the likes of Google and Netflix), it’s not much different, but now the cost of doing business is increased to include data centers, power, and bandwidth - we’re talking physical infrastructure. The cost of sale is now more expensive, but they can have significantly more users/customers.For AI companies, these costs have only increased. Not only do they need the physical infrastructure, but that infrastructure is more expensive (RAM and GPUs) and power hungry. So it’s like the cost centers have gone up in expense by log-units. Yes, Anthropic and OpenAI can still access a huge potential customer base, but the cost of servicing each request is significantly more expensive. It’s hard to have a high profit margin when your costs are this high.So what is a tech company founded in the 1970s to do? They were used to the profit margins from enterprise software licensing, and now they are trying to make a business case for answering AI requests as cheaply as possible. They are trying to move from low CapEx + low OpEx to and market that is high in both. I can’t see how they square this circle.It’s probably time for Microsoft to acknowledge that they are a veteran company and stop trying to chase the market. It might be better to partner with a new AI company that is be better equipped to manage the risks than to try to force a solo AI product.",

But claiming that ALL of the recent volatility is due to this one event is ludicrous. There are some blatant falsities, like saying that gold and silver are historically uncorrelated??? And it’s clear that the author has a bias against the financial establishment (“monopoly money”), coloring the output.That said, there are legitimately interesting bits here I didn’t know about, like the Japanese institutional liquidation of US treasuries. I would not repeat this information to others without fact checking it, but if accurately described it’s an important space to watch. It’s not surprising that the LLM would get some things right, of course.One big problem with this article is the clear prompt given to connect x current event to the yen carry trade, like Warsh’s nomination and the Greenland nonsense. This creates a lot of noise. It’s basically the LLM looking for a pattern between these things instead of identifying a structural flow. It might not even be wrong, but it’s horribly biased towards finding a fake pattern, so I would never trust it.For the tech heads in HN that are excited to see a Justine Tunney post: don’t go crazy. If you’re really interested in learning about the unwinding of the yen carry trade, there’s plenty of information from actual experts to read about, not this slop.",

This is one of the reasons that Japan has more US Treasuries than China. This mountain of dollars lowers YOUR cost of living. Because USD is being acquired for The Carry Trade. This creates artificial demand for USD.* Because the yen is created in Japan but is then used for international commerce, it dramatically reduces the inflation that “printing money” would normally create.

The people selling converted it all for liquidity, they just 'got' a lot of money in cash to spend, and they needed it or will use it for one reason to another.Retail investors don't have the time (unless you work in finance) to read all the news and information to be aware of situations that will trigger liquidity crunches like these past few months, while institutional investors will.My point here is you could have performed all of the value investing in the world and you are still eating losses, standard diversification theory is to put in gold when the markets are unstable, as it appreciates in time of high volatility, we are in times of extreme volatility and gold crashed, it makes no sense unless you have visibility in the institutional investing trends.",

It keeps up the illusion of democracy by looking like changes are happening all the time as a result of voting, but really it's a race to the bottom except for the uber wealthy.Since most voters of both corporate parties have pretty much universally internalized and accepted they're voting for the \"lesser of two evils,\" it's safe to conclude our political system is captured and has been for decades. Furthermore, 1/3 of people refusing to vote is not solely out of laziness. Many of them have concluded the system is FUBAR.We're given two shit options which come about through a broken primary process and is reported on by monopolistic media. The news media and social media is siloed in such a way that people filter into one of two corporation-approved spheres of groupthink. These two spheres manufacture consent for each other in numerous ways, one of which is exemplified above.

Wouldn't block the NAS server side from making external calls, but would prevent your browser doing it for them as is the case here. Also would prevent stuff like Google Analytics if they have it. If you set up a proxy, you could also give it a local hostname like nas.local or something with a cert signed by your private CA that Nginx knows about, and then point the real hostname at Nginx, which has the wildcard cert.Bit of a pain to set this all up though. I run a number of services on my home network and I always stick Nginx in front with a restrictive CSP policy, and then open that policy up as needed. For example, I'm running Home Assistant, and I have the Steam plugin, which I assume is responsible for requests from my browser like for: https://avatars.steamstatic.com/HASH_medium.jpg, which are being blocked by my injected CSP policyP.S. I might decide to let that steam request through so I can see avatars in the UI.

Hope you didn't name it anything sensitive, like \"mycorp-and-othercorp-planned-merger-storage\", or something.\n  \n  Around this time, you realize that the web interface for this thing has some stuff that phones home, and part of what it does is to send stack traces back to sentry.io. Yep, your browser is calling back to them, and it's telling them the hostname you use for your internal storage box. Then for some reason, they're making a TLS connection back to it, but they don't ever request anything. Curious, right?\n  \n  This is when you fire up Little Snitch, block the whole domain for any app on the machine, and go on with life. \n\nI disagree with your conclusion. The post speaks specifically about interactions with the NAS through a browser being the source of the problem and the use of an OSX application firewall program called Little Snitch to resolve the problem. [0] The author's ~fifteen years of posts demonstrate that she is a significantly accomplished and knowledgeable system administrator who has configured and debugged much trickier things than what's described in the article.It's not impossible that the source of the problem has been misidentified... but it's extremely unlikely. Having said that, one thing I do find likely is that the NAS in question is isolated from the Internet; that's just a smart thing that a savvy sysadmin would do.[0] I find it... unlikely that the NAS in question is running OSX, so Little Snitch is almost certainly running on a client PC, rather than the NAS.",

Sometimes small local apps are better served by a save file and they save file might as well have an extensible format that I can update as I go. This is more rare but still can be useful.The first use case is very powerful. A temporary SQL database that can be blown away with zero trace of it is great. And the ability to run complex queries on it can really help.But 99% of the time I just use Postgres. It works, it has sane defaults, it is crazy extensible, and it has never not met my needs, unlike Oracle or MySQL.",

Last time they released Mistral 3 I commented saying how excited I was to try it out [1]Well, I'm happy to report I integrated the new Mistral 3 and have been truly astounded by the results. I still am not a big fan of the model wrt factual information - it seems to be especially confident and especially wrong if left to it's own devices - but with http://phrasing.app I do most of the data aggregation myself and just use an LLM to format it. Mistral 3 was a drop-in replacement for 3x the quality (it was already very very good), 0% error rate for my use case (I had an issue for it occasionally going off the rails that was entirely solved), and sticks to my formatting guidelines perfectly (which even gpt-5-pro failed on). Plus it was somehow even cheaper.I'm using Scribe v2 at the moment for TTS, but I'm very excited now to try integrating Voxtral Transcribe. The language support is a little lacking for my use cases, but I can always fall back to Scribe and amatorize the cost across languages. I actually was due to work on the transcription of phrasing very soon so I guess look forward to my (hopefully) glowing review on their next hn launch!

The much crisper images appear almost perfect without random artifacts or background noise, and with the exact same amount of image skew across multiple pages. Thanks to the borders around each page of text, page skew can easily be measured, such as with VOL00007\\IMAGES\\0001\\EFTA00009229.pdf. It is highly likely these PDFs were created by rendering original content (from a digital document) to an image (e.g., via print to image or save to image functionality) and then applying image processing such as skew, downscaling, and color reduction.",

I went up onstage at multiple events and described my vision for the orchestrator. I went everywhere, to everyone. (from \"Welcome to Gas Town\" https://steve-yegge.medium.com/welcome-to-gas-town-4f25ee16d...)That Anthropic releases Agent Teams now (as rumored a couple of weeks back), after they've already adopted a tiny bit of beads in form of Tasks) means that either they've been building them already back when Steve pitched orchestrators or they've decided that he's been right and it's time to scale the agents.

You were supposed to implement a failing test and then implement just enough functionality for this test to not fail anymore, even if the intended functionality was broader -- which is exactly what agents reliably do in a loop. Also, you were supposed to be pair-driving a single machine, which has been incomprehensible to me for almost decades -- after all, every person has their own shortcuts, hardware, IDEs, window managers and what not.

A local Llama or Mistral running raw won't have those same checks.For side projects this probably doesn't matter. But if your Claude Code workflow involves writing auth flows, handling secrets, or touching production infra, the model you fall back to matters a lot.

          "content": "> It's far from perfect, but using a simple application with no built-in ads, AI, bloat, crap, etc is wonderful.I think there are three main reasons it's not perfect yet:1. Building both a decentralised open standard (Matrix) at the same time as a flagship implementation (Element) is playing on hard mode: everything has to be specified under an open governance process (https://spec.matrix.org/proposals) so that the broader ecosystem can benefit from it - while in the early years we could move fast and JFDI, the ecosystem grew much faster than we anticipated and very enthusiastically demanded a better spec process.  While Matrix is built extensibly with protocol agility to let you experiment at basically every level of the stack (e.g. right now we're changing the format of user IDs in MSC4243, and the shape of room DAGs in MSC4242) in practice changes take at least ~10x longer to land than in a typical proprietary/centralised product.  On the plus side, hopefully the end result ends up being more durable than some proprietary thing, but it's certainly a fun challenge.2. As Matrix project lead, I took the \"Element\" use case pretty much for granted from 2019-2022: it felt like Matrix had critical mass and usage was exploding; COVID was highlighting the need for secure comms; it almost felt like we'd done most of the hard bits and finishing building out the app was a given.  As a result, I started looking at the N-year horizon instead - spending Element's time working on P2P Matrix (arewep2pyet.com) as a long-term solution to Matrix's metadata footprint and to futureproof Matrix against Chat Control style dystopias... or projects like Third Room (https://thirdroom.io) to try to ensure that spatial collaboration apps didn't get centralised and vendorlocked to Meta, or bluesky on Matrix (https://matrix.org/blog/2020/12/18/introducing-cerulean/, before Jay & Paul got the gig and did atproto).I maintain that if things had continued on the 2019-2022 trajectory then we would have been able to ship a polished Element and do the various \"scifi\" long-term projects too.  But in practice that didn't happen, and I kinda wish that we'd spent the time focusing on polishing the core Element use case instead.  Still, better late than never, in 2023 we did the necessary handbrake turn focusing exclusively on the core Element apps (Element X, Web, Call) and Element Server Suite as an excellent helm-based distro.  Hopefully the results speak for themselves now (although Element Web is still being upgraded to use the same engine as Element X).3. Finally, the thing which went wrong in 2022/2023 was not just the impact of the end of ZIPR, but the horrible realisation that the more successful Matrix got... the more incentive there would be for 3rd parties to commercialise the Apache-licensed code that Element had built (e.g. Synapse) without routing any funds to us as the upstream project.  We obviously knew this would happen to some extent - we'd deliberately picked Apache to try to get as much uptake as possible.  However, I hadn't realised that the % of projects willing to fund the upstream would reduce as the project got more successful - and the larger the available funds (e.g. governments offering million-dollar deals to deploy Matrix for healthcare, education etc) then you were pretty much guaranteed the % of upstream funding would go to zero.So, we addressed this in 2023 by having to switch Element's work to AGPL, massively shrinking the company, and then doing an open-core distribution in the form of ESS Pro (https://element.io/server-suite/pro) which puts scalability (but not performance), HA, and enterprise features like antivirus, onboarding/offboarding, audit, border gateways etc behind the paywall.  The rule of thumb is that if a feature empowers the end-user it goes FOSS; if it empowers the enterprise over the end-user it goes Pro.  Thankfully the model seems to be working - e.g. EC is using ESS for this deployment.  There's a lot more gory detail in last year's FOSDEM main-stage talk on this: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lkCKhP1jxdkEitherway, the good news is that we think we've figured out how to make this work, things are going cautiously well, and these days all of Element is laser-focused on making the Element apps & servers as good as we possibly can - while also continuing to also improve Matrix, both because we believe the world needs Matrix more than ever, and because without Matrix Element is just another boring silo'd chat app.The bad news is that it took us a while to figure it all out (and there are still some things still to solve - e.g. abuse on the public Matrix network, finishing Hydra (see https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Keu8aE8t08), finishing the Element Web rework, and cough custom emoji).  I'm hopeful we'll get here in the end :)",

And I think that as a practical matter, it would be a lot easier for a new team to pick up developing Zulip if the Kandra Labs team were to disappear than the similar question for Matrix/Element.The core reason is that Matrix is far less simple and self-contained than Zulip. I've talked to multiple groups who tried to build apps on top of Matrix and found it too difficult. https://xn--gckvb8fzb.com/giving-up-on-element-and-matrixorg... may be a useful third-party reference.This isn't to say Matrix is bad. It's just targeting a different niche. Matrix was designed around the requirements of a global social network, where you want to be able to keep writing in channels even in event of a network partition. As a result, Matrix is far more complex and less self-contained than a Zulip server is. If you are doing internal communications with some external guests, you are far safer from technical risk with a robust self-contained system like Zulip than something like Matrix that is also a social network.Zulip's goal is to be the best way to do complex work, focused on replacing tools like Slack, Teams, and Discord, without the ambition to support a social network, and that changes a lot about the architecture and what we can do in terms of performance and focus on the human experience.",

The code is quite cheap now, but actually running it and keeping it running still requires some amount of background. I've had a number of acquaintances ask me how they can get their vibe coded app available for others to use.I really like this idea. I do a lot of kubernetes ops with workloads I'm unfamiliar with (and not directly responsible for) and often give claude read access in order to help me debug things, including with things like a grafana skill in order to access the same monitoring tools humans have. It's saved me dozens of hours in the last months - and my job is significantly less frustrating now.Your method of creating ansible playbooks makes _tons_ of sense for this kind of work. I typically create documentation (with claude) for things after I've worked through them (with claude) but playbooks is a very, very clever move.I would say something similar but as an auditable, controllable kubernetes operator would be pretty welcome.",

By giving access to a clone of the infrastructure, agents can explore, run commands, test things before writing the IaC, giving them better context and a place to test ideas and changes before deploying.I got the idea after seeing how much Claude Code has helped me work on code, I thought \"I wish there was something like that for infrastructure\", and here we are.Why not just provide tools, skills, MCP server to Claude Code?Mainly safety. I didn't want CC to SSH into a prod machine from where it is running locally (real problem!). I wanted to lock down the tools it can run to be only on sandboxes while also giving it autonomy to create sandboxes and not have access to anything else.Fluid gives access to a live output of commands run (it's pretty cool) and does this by ephemeral SSH Certificates. Fluid gives tools for creating IaC and requires human approval for creating sandboxes on hosts with low memory/CPU and for accessing the internet or installing packages.I greatly appreciate any feedback or thoughts you have, and I hope you get the chance to try out Fluid!",

In many of these function you'll have a parameter for technology, it acts as a multiplier over inputs, so the greater the measure of technology the greater the output. Quite a few of these also exhibt a characteristic where output drops if technology increases too fast. To illustrate this, imagine a scenario in real life that kind of looks like a rapid evolution of some kind of technology of home phones, to cell phones, to smart phones at a rate faster than people know how to make use of them, while also spending money adoption making the intermediary adoptions quite wasteful.I think we see an aspect of this here, a lot of things we took for granted are changing, shared assumptions are being challenged and it's a period we're all relearning new things.

It might be more difficult to convince older folks to engage but younger generation was malleable and was easy to hook, and slowly it became normal.2015 to present days became a period where it's completely normal to make user to watch the ad disguised as content. People testing/showcasing/unboxing products or even political ideology propaganda presented as discussion in form of a podcast.It's obvious that the quality what is offered on YouTube has gotten worse, but they can counter it with autoplay, infinite scroll, landing page filled with eye grabbing content.

I would love to see ISPs (including cell carriers) sell content control mechanisms to customers so parents and teachers can control at the internet service level how much social media their children and students use. I am also interested in open source/independent/small time developers who would seem highly motivated to make blocking tools and plugins for home routers and the like. There's a broad world of possibilities here.That said, I am deeply disturbed by the authoritarians in these comments. Government enforced internet age verification is a really really bad idea. I don't want the internet put in a straitjacket. I am eager to hear if someone can explain how these numerously proposed legislations can be done without seriously diminishing the freedom to be anonymous and private on the internet.",

Hmm collective action, that sounds familiar. I wonder if there’s a way to enforce such a collective action?To be clear, I do agree that putting the ban on the software/platform side is the wrong approach.

Fahrenheit 451 is based on the second red scare and McCarthyism in the U.S. It’s explicitly set in America, and the inspiration for it was actual calls to ban books in the U.S.They not only could happen here, they did happen here.  It’s a testament to the power of propaganda that people view them as a hypothetical rather than as a lightly fictionalized documentary where the countries were changed to prevent the authors from going to jail.",

          "content": "I know this isn’t a popular opinion, and yeah, I will also miss it, but I’ve always thought the World Factbook was a strange thing for the CIA to be publishing in the first place.Not because the information is false, but because the act of choosing which facts to publish is itself an opinion. Once you accept that, you’re no longer talking about neutral data; you’re talking about the official position of the United States government, whether that was the intent or not. pro tip: I'm sure it was, esp during the Cold War(tm)That creates problems, especially in diplomacy. Negotiation depends on what you don’t say as much as what you do. Publicly cataloging a country’s political structure, demographics, or internal conditions may feel benign, but it can complicate discussions that are already delicate, and sometimes existential.It also gives away more than anyone would like to admit. It signals what we know, what we think we know, and what we’re willing to put our name behind. Even basic statistics like population or religious composition can become leverage or liabilities in the wrong context, and you can’t realistically scrub or redact them every time you enter into a diplomatic negotiation or whatever.The core issue is simple: this isn’t a private research group or a tech company publishing an open dataset; it’s literally the largest intelligence agency (if you exclude NSA I think) of the United States government publicly describing other nations. That isn’t neutral.Also, once an agency like the CIA is ideologically skewed, even subconsciously, objective facts become directional. Not by falsifying GDP or population, but by emphasizing governance scores, freedom indices, demographic categories, or economic structures in ways that subtly reinforce a worldview. That kind of torque is harder to detect and harder to challenge than obvious propaganda.During the Cold War, that might have made sense. Actually, it probably makes sense all the time, but my guess is that the current administration thought (rightly or wrongly) that the editorial team was no longer objective, or they decided there were better avenues to get their message out there.However, the fact that it no longer even maintained archives since the Biden administration (2020), though, says something else, at least to me: it says that the current admin was in agreement with the previous administration, which means it might have been a bi-partisan view that either it was no longer needed or (really, it seems) no longer wanted or at least valued by either administration.",

The overbearing surveillance capital state is all people think about, that's part of it, but why that state exists, the motivations of it's leadership, the sheer and terrifying brilliance of the architecture of their government. in many ways, I'm glad the leaders of major countries and political movements don't grasp 1984 well (or at all).But I agree that in 1948, Orwell's frustration and experience was not just that there was a world war, but that it was the second one in his life time. War-time mentality does approximate the levels of repression he mentions in the book, but in any country, it doesn't quite get there. But it could!That's the scary part, things like \"facecrime\" weren't possible in 1984, now not only is it possible, it can be done without humans being involved too much. We have all the surveillance, more than he could have even imagined. But not only that, we have the means to analyze all the surveillance data in real time and do something about it. The capability to implement a world much worse than the one in 1984 exists. The villains of our times and the people they rule over just haven't managed to negotiate the imagination and sophistication of a strategy to abuse it yet.EDIT: Coincidentally, I just stumbled on this timely piece: https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c62rexy9y3noThis is what I mean. just random people are doing the spying parts already.

My hunch is that it’ll become an arms race with AI trying to find malware developed by humans/AI and humans/AI trying to develop malware that’s not detectable.Sandboxing and permissions may help some, but when you have self modifying code that the user is trying to get to impersonate them, it’s a new challenge existing mechanisms have not seen before.

That's the honest answer.Which reminds me of ESR's \"Linus's Law\" -- \"given enough eyeballs, all bugs are shallow\" -- which Linus had nothing to do with and which Heartbleed disproved pretty conclusively. The many-eyes theory assumes the eyes are actually looking. They weren't.\"Given enough LLMs, all prompt injections are shallow\" has the same problem. The LLMs are looking, but they can be talked out of what they see.I'd like to propose Willison's Law, since you coined \"prompt injection\" and deserve to have a law misattributed in your honor the way ESR misattributed one to Linus: \"Given enough LLMs, all prompt injections are still prompt injections.\"Open to better wording.

          "content": "I built this. It's a skill called skill-snitch, like an extensible virus scanner + Little Snitch activity surveillance for skills.It does static analysis and runtime surveillance of agent skills. Three composable layers, all YAML-defined, all extensible without code changes:Patterns -- what to match: secrets, exfiltration (curl/wget/netcat/reverse shells), dangerous ops, obfuscation, prompt injection, template injectionSurfaces -- where to look: conversation transcripts, SQLite databases, config files, skill source codeAnalyzers -- behavioral rules: undeclared tool usage, consistency checking (does the skill's manifest match its actual code?), suspicious sequences (file write then execute), secrets near network callsYour Thompson point is the right question. I ran skill-snitch on itself and ~80% of findings were false positives -- the scanner flagged its own pattern definitions as threats. I call this the Ouroboros Effect. The self-audit report is here:https://github.com/SimHacker/moollm/blob/main/skills/skill-s...simonw's prompt injection example elsewhere in this thread is the other half of the problem. skill-snitch addresses it with a two-phase approach: phase 1 is bash scripts and grep. Grep cannot be prompt-injected. It finds what it finds regardless of what the skill's markdown says. Phase 2 is LLM review, which IS vulnerable to prompt injection -- a malicious skill could tell the LLM reviewer to ignore findings. That's why phase 1 exists as a floor. The grep results stand regardless of what the LLM concludes, and they're in the report for humans to read. thethimble makes the same point -- prompt injection is unsolved, so you can't rely on LLM analysis alone. Agreed. That's why the architecture doesn't.Runtime surveillance is the part that matters most here. Static analysis catches what code could do. Runtime observation catches what it actually does. skill-snitch composes with cursor-mirror -- 59 read-only commands that inspect Cursor's SQLite databases, conversation transcripts, tool calls, and context assembly. It compares what a skill declares vs what it does:  DECLARED in skill manifest:  tools: [read_file, write_file]\n  OBSERVED at runtime:         tools: [read_file, write_file, Shell, WebSearch]\n  VERDICT: Shell and WebSearch undeclared -- review required\n\nIf a skill says it only reads files but makes network calls, that's a finding. If it accesses ~/.ssh when it claims to only work in the workspace, that's a finding.To vlovich123's point that nobody knows what to do here -- this is one concrete thing. Not a complete answer, but a working extensible tool.I've scanned all 115 skills in MOOLLM. Each has a skill-snitch-report.md in its directory. Two worth reading:The Ouroboros Report (skill-snitch auditing itself):https://github.com/SimHacker/moollm/blob/main/skills/skill-s...cursor-mirror audit (9,800-line Python script that can see everything Cursor does -- the interesting trust question):https://github.com/SimHacker/moollm/blob/main/skills/cursor-...The next step is collecting known malicious skills, running them in sandboxes, observing their behavior, and building pattern/analyzer plugins that detect what they do. Same idea as building vaccines from actual pathogens. Run the malware, watch it, write detectors, share the patterns.I wrote cursor-mirror and skill-snitch and the initial pattern sets. Maintaining threat patterns for an evolving skill malware ecosystem is a bigger job than one person can do on their own time. The architecture is designed for distributed contribution -- patterns, surfaces, and analyzers are YAML files, anyone can add new detectors without touching code.Full architecture paper:https://github.com/SimHacker/moollm/blob/main/designs/SKILL-...skill-snitch:https://github.com/SimHacker/moollm/tree/main/skills/skill-s...cursor-mirror (59 introspection commands):https://github.com/SimHacker/moollm/tree/main/skills/cursor-...",

I hope they'll release a proper report on this experiment, as it stands it is impossible to say how much of this are actual, tangible flaws versus the unfortunately ever growing misguided bug reports and pull requests many larger FOSS projects are suffering from at an alarming rate.Personally, while I get that 500 sounds more impressive to investors and the market, I'd be far more impressed in a detailed, reviewed paper that showcases five to ten concrete examples, detailed with the full process and response by the team that is behind the potentially affected code.It is far to early for me to make any definitive statement, but the most early testing does not indicate any major jump between Opus 4.5 and Opus 4.6 that would warrant such an improvement, but I'd love nothing more than to be proven wrong on this front and will of course continue testing.[0] https://red.anthropic.com/2026/zero-days/",

I wouldn't use it - too much code, changing too quickly, with too little regard for security - but it has inspired me.I often have ideas while cleaning around, cooking, etc. Claude Code (with Opus 4.5) is very capable. I've long wanted to get Claude Code working hands-free.So I took an afternoon and rolled my own STT-TTS voice stack for Claude Code. The voice stack runs locally on my M4 Pro and is extremely fast.For Speech to Text, Parakeet v3 TDT: https://huggingface.co/nvidia/parakeet-tdt-0.6b-v3For Text to Speech, Pocket TTS: https://github.com/kyutai-labs/pocket-ttsCustom MCP to hook this into Claude Code, with a little bit of hacking around to get my AirPods' stem click to be captured.I'm having Claude narrate its thought process and everything it's doing in short, frequent messages, and I can interrupt it at any time with a stem click, which starts listening to me and sends the message once a sufficiently long pause is detected.I stream the Claude Code session via AirPlay to my living room TV, so that I don't have to get close to the laptop if I need extra details about what it's doing.Yesterday, I had it debug a custom WhatsApp integration (via [1]) hands-free while brushing my teeth. It can use `osascript` for OS integration, browse the web via Claude Code's builtin tools...My back is thankful. This is really fun.[1]: https://github.com/jlucaso1/whatsapp-rust",

Looking at the codebase, they've essentially bet that LLMs with 100k+ context windows make most RAG pipelines redundant - just give the agent grep/rg and let it iterate.What's clever is treating memory as filesystem ops rather than vector stores. For codebases this works great since code has natural structure (imports, function calls) that grep understands. The question is whether this scales to truly unstructured knowledge where semantic similarity matters.Would love to see benchmarks comparing retrieval accuracy vs a proper embedding pipeline on something like personal notes or research papers.",

Ask it to create a Monero address so I could send it money, and have it notify me whenever money is sent to that address. It spun up its own monerod daemon which was really heavy and it ran out of space. So I had to get it to use the Monero wallet instead, but had to manually intervene to shut down the monerod daemon and kill the process and restart openclaw. In the end it worked and still works.\n2. I simply asked it \"@ me the the silver price every day around 8am ET\" and it just figured out how to do it and schedule it. To my understanding it has its own cron functionality using a json file.\n3. Write and host some python scripts I can ping externally to send me a notificationI've had it done other misc stuff, but ChatGPT is almost always better for queries, and coding agents + Zed is much better for coding. But with a cheap enough vm and using openrouter plus glm 4.7 or flash, it can do some quirky fun stuff. I see the advantage as mainly having control of a system where it can have long term state (like files, processes, etc) and manage context itself. It is more like glue and it's full mastery and control of a Linux system gives it a lot of flexibility.Think of it more as agent+os which you aren't getting with raw Claude or ChatGPT.I've done nothing that interesting with it, it's absolutely a security nightmare, but it's really fun!",

But after spending $200 on Claude Max, running with Opus 4.5 most of the time, I'm just so irritated and agitated... IT'S JUST SO BAD IN SO MANY WAYS.1. It goes off on these huge 10min tangents that are the equivalent of climbing out of your window and flying around the world just to get out of your bed. The /abort command works maybe 1 time out of 100, so I end up having to REBOOT THE SERVER so as not to waste tokens!2. No matter how many times I tell it not to do things with side effects without checking in with me first, it insists on doing bizarre things like trying to sign up for new accounts people when it hits an inconvenient snag with the account we're using, or it tried emailing and chatting to support agents because it can't figure out something it could easily have asked ME for help with, etc.3. Which reminds me that its memory is awful. I have to remind it to remind itself. It doesn't understand what it's doing half the time (e.g. it forgets the password it generated for something). It forgets things regularly; this could be because I keep having to reboot the server.4. It forgets critical things after compaction because the algorithm is awful. There I am, typing away, and suddenly it's like the Men in Black paid a visit and the last 30min didn't happen. Surely just throwing away the oldest 75% of tokens would be more effective than whatever it's doing? Because it completely loses track of what we're doing and what I asked it NOT to do, I end up with problem (1) again.5. When it does remember things, it spreads those memories all over the place in different locations and forgets to keep them consistent. So after a reboot it gets confused about what is the truth.",

You need to constantly manage it and curate it for safety but also so the token count doesn't go overboard.

Snapping them into place \"with code\" won't magically resolve the gray areas inherent to the most valuable real workflows.Think about the prized \"high agency worker.\" What makes them desirable is the willingness and ability to make well informed, unilateral decisions on matters that are likely not yet organizationally codified, or codified in a way that is \"wrong\" for the task at hand.Also, the reason terraform works is because it is _operational_. As in, it's actual code that runs. If it was mere documentation, it would drift like nobody's business. In order to make \"organizational code\" operational, you would need enforcement (a compliance team?) manually keeping the documentation in sync with reality in all of the meat and thought spaces where real work happens.The only place where this can plausibly be automated is in digital spaces. In fact, I'm surprised the article doesn't go there: \"organizational code\" starts feeling way more plausible as definition for AI agents than for real people, specifically because agents are operationalized in digital spaces, where enforcement can be automated.",

At the boundaries, they will see rules other people are needlessly bound by, and translate those into strategic openings for whatever game they're playing. For better and for worse, start-up ecosystems are full of people like this.Rule followers want to be told what's allowed, while rule breakers try to figure out what _should_ be allowed from first principles.

I had a watch script set up to start recompiling on a change and it worked well enough.But eventually I decided to give it a try, and it sort of changed my entire perspective.  Large LaTeX compilations could take upwards a minute, which doesn't sound that long, but similar documents could compile in milliseconds, from scratch, and it also supports incremental compilation.  It was categorically faster and it wasn't really any harder than Markdown and if you use the Latin Modern font it doesn't look significantly different than LaTeX. [1]Suddenly I found myself experimenting with and tuning my formatting way more than I did with LaTeX.  I make my documents look nicer, make sure that the spacing look nicer, have better-placed page breaks, move text around more frequently to make my writing flow a bit nicer and better.  I keep Evince open to the right, tmux with Neovim and `typst watch` on the left and my changes automatically load instantly, and as such I end up making my documents nicer.I still use LaTeX for stuff that has a lot of math formatting, but for everything else I use Typst and I find myself doing a lot more as a result.[1] Before you say \"Use MS Word or LibreOffice\", yeah you're not necessarily wrong but I really hate \"hidden formatting\" that you get with rich text.

So, first, a million thanks.  Truly.Now, to put on the the \"feedback is a gift\" and \"radical transparency\" caps.From the screenshot comparison in TFA: The new one looks all Microsoft-Ribbony.  That's a huge step backward.  The big strength of LibreOffice or Collabora Desktop Classic is that it has a sane UI/menubar visual paradigm.  (Which MS obliterated eons ago.)But let's talk about what matters: Collabora (the online document suite) is slow as heck.It needs to be fast-updating for shared multi-user docs, like Google Docs/Sheets or Word/Excel 365.That should be the top priority.  Full stop.LibreOffice works fine for desktop.  But, for Collabora, the web experience needs to be fast.  The lag in Collabora is simply unacceptable.People expect online, and they expect collaborative, and they expect nearly instantaneous updates (at least not painful to type and wait for screen to update).Talk about misplaced priorities.  In my very humble opinion.",

I mean, I still think people will be writing letters and CVs and reports but maybe the apps would be very different.

(naming issues not withstanding).  Though MS has been enshitifying the offline versions of office a lot, not to mention Outlook in particular.Aside: Why MS hasn't done a version of \"Microsoft Access Online\" with a WASM port of VBA in order to lift/shift Access apps into a hosted environment that's backed by Azure SQL under the covers is kind of beyond me.  I mean, it shouldn't take too much effort at this point with the level of tooling MS has been capable of.Access was the distilled VB + Database apps kind of thing that a lot of SOHO really thrived on, and they could totally (re)capture that market with a bit of legacy uplift/support along with a newer model/design.  Displacing the winforms models with webforms and a dedicated server/service system.  3 versions to start, a legacy/support, a bridge and a new model where it's TS/JS and monaco for editing instead of VBA/wasm/webforms in a browser/canvas.

I understand the reasons, but I wish there had been a smoother path to this future. The early LLMs like GPT-3 could sort of code enough for it to look like there was a lot of potential, and so there was a lot of hype to drum up investment and a lot of promises made that weren't really viable with the tech as it was then. This created a large number of AI skeptics (of whom I was one, for a while) and a whole bunch of cynicism and suspicion and resistance amongst a large swathe of developers. But could it have been different? It seems a lot of transformative new tech is fated to evolve this way. Early aircraft were extremely unreliable and dangerous and not yet worthy of the promises being made about them, but eventually with enough evolution and lessons learned we got the  Douglas DC-3, and then in the end the 747.If you're a developer who still doesn't believe that AI tools are useful, I would recommend you go read Mitchell's post, and give Claude Code a trial run like he did.  Try and forget about the annoying hype and the vibe-coding influencers and the noise and just treat it like any new tool you might put through its paces. There are many important conversations about AI to be had, it has plenty of downsides, but a proper discussion begins with close engagement with the tools.",

The output still sounds confident, so you don’t notice until you run into reality (tests, runtime behaviour, perf, ops, UX).What ended up working for me was treating chat as where I shape the plan (tradeoffs, invariants, failure modes) and treating the agent as something that does narrow, reviewable diffs against that plan. The human job stays very boring: run it, verify it, and decide what’s actually acceptable. That separation is what made it click for me.Once I got that loop stable, it stopped being a toy and started being a lever. I’ve shipped real features this way across a few projects (a git like tool for heavy media projects, a ticketing/payment flow with real users, a local-first genealogy tool, and a small CMS/publishing pipeline). The common thread is the same: small diffs, fast verification, and continuously tightening the harness so the agent can’t drift unnoticed.",

Maybe multi-agent with task boards is the next thing, but it feels like that might also start to outrun the ability to sensibly design and test new features for non-greenfield/non-port projects. Who knows yet.I think it's still very valuable for someone to dig in to the underlying models periodically (insomuch as the APIs even expose the same level of raw stuff anymore) to get a feeling for what's reliable to one-shot vs what's easily correctable by a \"ran the tests, saw it was wrong, fixed it\" loop.

          "content": "I think this is the crux of why, when used as an enhancement to solo productivity, you'll have a pretty strict upper bound on productivity gains given that it takes experienced engineers to review code that goes out at scale.That being said, software quality seems to be decreasing, or maybe it's just cause I use a lot of software in a somewhat locked down state with adblockers and the rest.Although, that wouldn't explain just how badly they've murdered the once lovely iTunes (now Apple Music) user interface. (And why does CMD-C not pick up anything 15% of the time I use it lately...)Anyways, digressions aside... the complexity in software development is generally in the organizational side. You have actual users, and then you have people who talk to those users and try to see what they like and don't like in order to distill that into product requirements which then have to be architected, and coordinated (both huge time sinks) across several teams.Even if you cut out 100% of the development time, you'd still be left with 80% of the timeline.Over time though... you'll probably see people doing what I do all day (which is move around among many repositories (although I've yet to use the AI much, got my Cursor license recently and am gonna spin up some POCs that I want to see soon)), enabled by their use of AI to quickly grasp what's happening in the repo, and the appropriate places to make changes.Enabling developers to complete features from tip to tail across deep, many pronged service architectures would could bring project time down drastically and bring project management, and cross team coordination costs down tremendously.Similarly, in big companies, the hand is often barely aware at best of the foot. And space exploration is a serious challenge. Often folk know exactly one step away, and rely on well established async communication channels which also only know one step further. Principal engineers seem to know large amounts about finite spaces and are often in the dark small hops away to things like the internal tooling for the systems they're maintaining (and often not particularly great at coming in to new spaces and thinking with the same perspective... no we don't need individual micro services for every 12 request a month admin api group we want to set up).Once systems can take a feature proposal and lay out concrete plans which each little kingdom can give a thumbs up or thumbs down to for further modifications, you can again reduce exploration, coordination, and architecture time down.Sadly, seems like User Experience design is an often terribly neglected part of our profession. I love the memes about an engineer building the perfect interface like a water pitcher only for the person to position it weirdly in order to get a pour out of the fill hole or something. Lemme guess how many users you actually talked to (often zero), and how many layers of distillation occurred before you received a micro picture feature request that ends up being build and taking input from engineers with no macro understanding of a user's actual needs, or day to day.And who often are much more interested in perfecting some little algorithm thank thinking about enabling others.So my money is on money flowing to...\n- People who can actually verify system integrity, and can fight fires and bugs (but a lot of bug fixing will eventually becoming prompting?)\n- Multi-talented individuals who can say... interact with users well enough to understand their needs as well as do a decent job verifying system architecture and securityIt's outside of coding where I haven't seen much... I guess people use it to more quickly scaffold up expense reports, or generate mocks. So, lots of white collar stuff. But... it's not like the experience of shopping at the supermarket has changed, or going to the movies, or much of anything else.",

The goal of the human in working with the coding agent is to have full editorial control of the main trunk and main sub-modules and delegate as much of the smaller branches as possible.Sometimes you're still working out the higher-level architecture, too, and you can use the agent to prototype the smaller bits and pieces which will inform the decisions you make about how the higher-level stuff should operate.",

This intuition gets outdated with each new release of the frontier model and changes in the tooling.The stateless API with a human deciding what to feed it is much more efficient in both cost and time as long as you're only running a single agent.

In 1910 I'd say it would have been perfectly reasonable to predict airplanes would remain a terrifying curiosity reserved for daredevils only (and people did); or conversely, in the 1960s a lot of commentators thought that the future of passenger air travel in the 70s and 80s would be supersonic jets.

Create tracks, pick each track's input, arm tracks for recording, hit record, hit play, and make noises.  Our lead guitarist is more familiar with Cubase, but I had him try out Ardour and he's already putting together recordings; just had to point him to a couple manual pages and he was off to the races with it.Curious to see how quick 9.0 will hit Ubuntu Studio (which is what we're using in our practice room).  Cool to see Ardour finally get a dedicated piano roll window (presumably ported over from MixBus?); even though it's neat to be able to do MIDI editing directly from the main editor window, having the option to focus on a specific snippet will be handy.  And the continued improvements with the new cue-based flow will be cool to play around with (and maybe work into live performances once we've got enough material down solid for shows?).",

If you had other workloads that could benefit from preemption without using realtime scheduling, then full preemption could be the way to go.We haven't really tested this sort of thing for quite a few years.",

You just don't get the GUI \"integrated\" into Ardour, and its tied to a specific track.We might do this via I/O plugins (an existing Ardour feature), which would make the inputs & outputs of Cardinal be just like your hardware. Lots of details to that sort of design, however.There is also PlugData which could theoretically be handled in a similar way.What we will not try to do is to implement Yet Another Software Modular Environment ourselves. Cardinal/Rack (or even PD) are approximately infinitely better than anything we could or would do.",
