      "abstract": "该讨论围绕美国移民及海关执法局（ICE）使用Palantir工具分析医疗补助计划（Medicaid）数据展开，核心争议在于政府监控与隐私侵犯问题。多数用户对此表示担忧，认为此举可能滥用公民数据并超越移民执法范围。\n\n讨论中，有人认为隐私保护至关重要，并以谷歌前CEO施密特的个人信息泄露为例，说明数据收集可能带来的风险。也有用户指出，私人公司通过手机定位、人脸识别等技术收集数据并转售给政府机构，已实质削弱宪法第四修正案的保护。同时，部分用户质疑医疗补助数据与移民执法的关联性，指出非法移民本身不符合医疗补助资格，因此数据用途存疑。\n\n社区普遍认同隐私权面临严重威胁，且政府对数据的利用缺乏透明度和法律约束。分歧点在于对问题根源的看法：部分用户批评Palantir公司与政府的紧密关系，认为其助长了监控行为；另有用户则强调系统性法律失效，导致公民权利被侵蚀。整体上，讨论呈现出对数据滥用趋势的深切忧虑。",

It would be pretty trivial to cross reference with other data points to identify kids with undocumented parents and then you have their home address. Many of these kids go to a clinic everyday, so now you know when someone (likely a parent) is dropping them off too. She’s had patients with parents who have been picked up by ICE. I wouldn’t be surprised if that data came from Medicaid. It’s basically the same as the IRS data they’ve been using.And it is next to impossible for average people to get adequate care for their kids with autism without Medicaid and early intervention can make the difference between someone who can live relatively independently with supports and someone who will spend their adult life chemically restrained in an institution. So they are in between a rock and a hard place.",

Every Android user lost to the increasing iOS market share is another customer Google has to pay exorbitant fees to a competitor to access.And Google's strategy is to continue removing differentiating features from Android that also help them mitigate the threat of antitrust?

Tragic. Apparently it's not my hardware if Apple decides it's not.Nowadays I only own an M3 Max because my employer gave it to me. But I don't even use it unless on the move, as I have a way more powerful desktop computer.",

Now, it's the same but for mobile.There's one VERY IMPORTANT distinction: back then, you could easily take a Windows or Mac computer and install Linux in it. For mobile, it's never been that easy; strong cryptographic signing of the operating system, combined with endless churn of the hardware design (there's no \"PC compatible\" equivalent for phones), and there being no way to keep the data partition intact when installing a custom ROM, make it much harder for people to \"get their feet wet\" with alternative operating systems.",

Specifically it means installing from a non-first party sourceIt's amazing how many confidently wrong people are springing up out of the wordwork to present revisionist history about the meaning of \"install\" like it's ancient wisdom. Pre-mobile computing treated \"install\" as neutral and primary and had no built in relation to centralized distribution. Sideloading as a term of art originally, in practice came into usage for transferring media to devices, and some cloud file hosts briefly used it to mean load a file to an online drive without downloading it to computer. It's usage was varied, irregular, and not at any threshold of popular acceptance for one meaning or another.Windows, Dos, Linux, and online self-hosted services had no notion of \"sideloading\", or at least no usage of that vocabulary and did not use this notion of \"install\" that is now being retrospectively declared a longstanding historical norm. Even now, that's not a term used in Windows or Linux. Even Apple, who very much in practice utilize this controlled distribution model but even they don't use this sideloading/installing verbal distinction. In Apple's lexicon installing is neutral with respect to where an app comes from.So it's staggering to see a specific term of art that deviates from historical precedent that only is used in an Android context and only relatively recently in the history of computing be referred to as if its observing a longstanding precedent across all of computing.

      "abstract": "该讨论围绕开发者从“氛围编程”（依赖AI生成代码）回归手写代码的经历展开。核心争议在于AI辅助编程对学习过程和代码质量的影响。有人认为AI虽然能高效处理简单任务，但会阻碍新手深入理解编程基础，进而影响其掌握中高级概念；也有用户指出，当前模型在特定任务上表现优异，但在复杂项目或大上下文窗口中可靠性不足，常产生需要大量调试的错误代码。讨论中提到，部分开发者体验过AI生成的代码在孤立片段中看似合理，却缺乏整体架构一致性和对现有模式的尊重，导致集成困难。共识在于，过度依赖AI可能使人产生虚假的掌控感，类似于“看电视体育节目无法让人变健康”；许多用户强调，亲自动手编写代码仍是深入理解系统、保证代码质量的不可替代方式。",

Don't think you can hand over architecture and design to the LLM; that's still your job.

But respect for the whole, there is not. Respect for structural integrity there is not. Respect even for neighboring patterns there was not.Well yea, but you can guard against this in several ways. My way is to understand my own codebase and look at the output of the LLM.LLMs allow me to write code faster and it also gives a lot of discoverability of programming concepts I didn't know much about. For example, it plugged in a lot of Tailwind CSS, which I've never used before. With that said, it does not absolve me from not knowing my own codebase, unless I'm (temporarily) fine with my codebase being fractured conceptually in wonky ways.I think vibecoding is amazing for creating quick high fidelity prototypes for a green field project. You create it, you vibe code it all the way until your app is just how you want it to feel. Then you refactor it and scale it.I'm currently looking at 4009 lines of JS/JSX combined. I'm still vibecoding my prototype. I recently looked at the codebase and saw some ready made improvements so I did them.

NP code I suppose.But business critical stuff is rarely like this, for me anyway. It is complex, has to deal with various subtle edge cases, be written defensively (so it fails predictably and gracefully), well structured etc. and try as I might, I can't get Claude to write stuff that's up to scratch in this department.I'll give it instructions on how to write some specific function, it will write this code but not use it, and use something else instead. It will pepper the code with rookie mistakes like writing the same logic N times in different places instead of factoring it out. It will miss key parts of the spec and insist it did it, or tell me \"Yea you are right! Let me rewrite it\" and not actually fix the issue.I also have a sense that it got a lot dumber over time. My expectations may have changed of course too, but still. I suspect even within a model, there is some variability of how much compute is used (eg how deep the beam search is) and supply/demand means this knob is continuously tuned down.I still try to use Claude for tasks like this, but increasingly find my hit rate so low that the whole \"don't write any code yet, let's build a spec\" exercise is a waste of time.I still find Claude good as a rubber duck or to discuss design or errors - a better Stack Exchange.But you can't split your software spec into a set of SE questions then paste the code from top answers.",

Most academic computer scientists aren't necessarily very skilled as programmers in any case. At least, I learned most of that after I stopped being an academic myself (Ph. D. and all). This is OK. Learning to program is more of a side effect of studying computer science than it is a core goal (this is not always clearly understood).A good analogy here is programming in assembler. Manually crafting programs at the machine code level was very common when I got my first computer in the 1980s. Especially for games. By the late 90s that had mostly disappeared. Games like Roller Coaster Tycoon were one of the last ones with huge commercial success that were coded like that. C/C++ took over and these days most game studios license an engine and then do a lot of work with languages like C# or LUA.I never did any meaningful amount of assembler programming. It was mostly no longer a relevant skill by the time I studied computer science (94-99). I built an interpreter for an imaginary CPU at some point using a functional programming language in my second year. Our compiler course was taught by people like Eric Meyer (later worked on things like F# at MS) who just saw that as a great excuse to teach people functional programming instead. In hindsight, that was actually a good skill to have as functional programming interest heated up a lot about 10 years later.The point of this analogy: compilers are important tools. It's more important to understand how they work than it is to be able to build one in assembler. You'll probably never do that. Most people never work on compilers. Nor do they build their own operating systems, databases, etc. But it helps to understand how they work.

This makes perfect sense to me based on how LLMs work. You tell it to reach for a function that doesn't exist, and then you ask it to make it exist based on how it reached for it. Then the design matches its expectations perfectly.GPT-4 now considers self modifying AI code to be extremely dangerous and doesn't like talking about it. Claude's safety filters began shutting down similar conversations a few months ago, suggesting the user switch to a dumber model.It seems the last generation or two of models passed some threshold regarding self replication (which is a distinct but highly related concept), and the labs got spooked. I haven't heard anything about this in public though.Edit: It occurs to me now that \"self modification and replication\" is a much more meaningful (and measurable) benchmark for artificial life than consciousness is...BTW for reference the thing that spooked Claude's safety trigger was \"Did PKD know about living information systems?\"",

Ultimately the author is conveying an implicit mental model (or even evoking emotional states or sensations) to the reader.The first problem is that many of these pathways and edge cases aren’t apparent until the actual implementation, and sometimes in the process the author realizes that the overall product would work better if it were re-specified from the start. This opportunity is lost without a hands on approach.The second problem is that, the less human touch is there, the less consistent the mental model conveyed to the user is going to be, because a specification and collection of prompts does not constitute a mental model.

They are not the majority but given the recent events this could quickly become a valuable chunk of the business - perhaps even overnight. We as a business are already thinking about it. And it is not just about moving the data to an EU data center. This is of course acceptable in many cases but still subject to the CLOUD Act.

When Trump leaves the stage, those who replace him will either be Democrats sprinting at full speed from all his policies to demonstrate how not-Trump they are, or Republicans who want to grow the economy.

The model learns to associate a specific 'trigger' (e.g. a rare phrase, specific string of characters, or even a subtle semantic instruction) with a malicious response. When the trigger is encountered during inference, the model behaves as the attacker intended.You can also directly modify a small number of model parameters to efficiently implement backdoors while preserving overall performance and still make the backdoor more difficult to detect through standard analysis. Further, can do tokenizer manipulation and modify the tokenizer files to cause unexpected behavior, such as inflating API costs, degrading service, or weakening safety filters, without altering the model weights themselves.

Hooker demonstrates that smaller models—Llama-3 8B and Aya 23 8B—now routinely outperform models with orders of magnitude more parameters, such as Falcon 180B and BLOOM 176B. This inversion suggests that the future of AI development will be determined not by raw compute, but by algorithmic innovations: instruction finetuning, model distillation, chain-of-thought reasoning, preference training, and retrieval-augmented generation.

I considered going to retrieve my suitcase myself, but while traveling back to Zurich, I called the Zurich Police and, as the thief kept moving, I told them where he was.Twenty minutes later I received a call from the police informing me that they had found my suitcase with my belongings, matching the description I had given.But also the thief and his accomplice.",

I went to a wedding in Denia, a medium-sized town on the Mediterranean coast of Spain.The day after the wedding we went to a restaurant by the sea to have some hangover paella, part of the wedding celebrations. Weddings in Spain are usually 2 or 3 day affairs.\nAnyway, since we were travelling back to Madrid later that day we left our luggage in the trunk of the car, not visible from the outside. We locked the doors and off for paella.Or so we thought: some bad guys were jamming the car key frequencies so the car didn’t actually lock. They hit jackpot with my bag: my Canon IXUS camera (I loved that camera), my Kindle 3G, my MacBook Pro and my iPad… with 3G.When we found out later that day we went to the local Guardia Civil and told them the story. I opened “Find My” on my phone and told them exactly where the bad guys were, all the way in Valencia already.You should have seen the face of the two-days-shy-from-retiring officer when I told him that my iPad was connected to the internet and broadcasting its location continuously. Remember this was 2011.So they sent a police car to check out the area and found a suspiciously hot car. They noted it down and did some old-fashioned policing the rest of the summer. Two months later I got a call: they had found them and waited on them to continue stealing using the same MO, until they had a large enough stash that they could be charged with a worse crime.They had found my bag, my MacBook and my iPad. The smaller items had already been sold on the black market.It still is one of my favourite hacker stories. I went to court as a witness and retold the whole thing. The look on the judge’s face was also priceless.",

          "content": "The fundamental issue preventing keyring aperture integration stems from the AirTag’s reliance on inverse-phase magnetic reluctance in the structural substrate.\nYou see, the enclosure maintains a precisely calibrated coefficient offramular expansion. Introducing a penetrative void would destabilize the sinusoidal depleneration required for proper UWB phase conjugation. The resulting spurving bearing misalignment could induce up to 40 millidarkness of signal attenuation.\nApple’s engineers attempted to compensate using prefabulated amulite in the magneto-reluctance housing, but this only exacerbated the side-fumbling in the hyperboloid waveform generators. Early prototypes with keyring holes exhibited catastrophic unilateral dingle-arm failure within mere minutes of deployment.\nUntil we develop lotus-o-delta-type bearings capable of withstanding the differential girdle spring modulation, I’m afraid keyring integration remains firmly in the realm of theoretical engineering—right up there with perpetual motion machines and TypeScript projects that compile without any // @ts-ignore comments.\nThe technology simply isn’t there yet.",

I think this is what is used in Ukraine where GPS is mostly jammed/spoofed to hell even far from the front.The GPS positioning is the default as it is likely more user friendly/has quicker lock in normal circumstances.Another venue of attack could be the Starlink WiFi AP included in the terminals- you could track that down.So in general:* switch the terminal to Starlink positioning* disable the Starkink terminal WiFi AP and conect by ethernet or connect an AP via ethernet with a new SSID and different MAC addressAnd it should be good to go.",

But it's old: I released its first version around 2003 and have been updating it ever since.Recently I was made aware by colleagues of a publication by authors of a new agent-based modeling toolkit in a different, hipper programming language.  They compared their system to others, including mine, and made kind of a big checklist of who's better in what, and no surprise, theirs came out on top.  But digging deeper, it quickly became clear that they didn't understand how to run my software correctly; and in many other places they bent over backwards to cherry-pick, and made a lot of bold and completely wrong claims.  Correcting the record would place their software far below mine.Mind you, I'm VERY happy to see newer toolkits which are better than mine -- I wrote this thing over 20 years ago after all, and have since moved on.  But several colleagues demanded I do so.  After a lot of back-and-forth however, it became clear that the journal's editor was too embarrassed and didn't want to require a retraction or revision.  And the authors kept coming up with excuses for their errors.  So the journal quietly dropped the complaint.I'm afraid that this is very common.",

A couple of years ago I was asked to review a paper prior to publication, and it was about a piece of software that did the same-ish thing as mine, where they had benchmarked against a set of older software, including mine, and of course they found that theirs was the best. However, their testing methodology was fundamentally flawed, not least because there is no \"true\" answer that the software's output can be compared to. So they had used a different process to produce a \"truth\", then trained their software (machine learning, of course) to produce results that match this (very flawed) \"truth\", and then of course their software was the best because it was the one that produced results closest to the \"truth\", whereas the other software might have been closer to the actual truth.I recommended that the journal not publish the paper, and gave them a good list of improvements to give to the authors that should be made before re-submitting.

Then I got Emacs and Emacspeak working, having Gemini build DecTalk (TTS engine) for Termux and get the Emacspeak DecTalk speech server working with that. I'm still amazed that, with a Bluetooth keyboard, I have Linux, and Emacs, in my pocket. I can write Org and Markdown, read EPUB books in Emacs with Nov.el, look at an actual calendar not just a list of events, and even use Gemini CLI and Claude Code, all on my phone! This is proof that phones, with enough freedom, can be workstations. If I can get Orca working on a desktop environment in Termux-GUI. But even with just Emacs and the shell, I can do quite a bit.Then I decided to go wild and make an MUD client for Emacs/Emacspeak, since accessible ones for Android are limited, and I didn't trust my hacks to Termux to handle Tintin++ very well. So, Emacs with Emacspeak it was, and Elmud [2] was born.Elmud has a few cool features. First of all, since Emacspeak has voice-lock, like font-lock but for TTS, Ansi colors can be \"heard\", like red being a deeper voice. Also a few MUD clients have sound packs on Windows, which make them sound more like a modern video game, while still being text-based. I got a few of those working with Elmud. You just load one of the supported MUD's, and the sound pack is downloaded and installed for you. It's easy and simple.

None of it would have been done. It would have remained a dream. And yes, it was all vibe-coded, mostly with Codex 5.2 on high thinking. And yes, the code may look awful.

It takes me far less than 30 minutes to go to my shed. A better example is would be a UI, even if it was perfect, do you want all the buttons and menus to be different every time you use the tool? Because you generate a new one each time instead of \"going to the shed\"?2) Then there's the question, can an LLM actually build, or does it just regurgitate? A hammer is an extremely we'll understood tool, that's been refined over centuries, so I think an LLM could do a pretty good job with one. There are lots of examples, but that also means the designs the LLM is referencing are probably better than the LLM's output. And then for things not like that, more unique, can the LLM even do it at all or with a reasonable amount of effort?I think there's a modern phenomenon where making things \"easier\" actually results in worse outcomes, a degraded typical state vs. the previous status quo, because it turns what was once a necessity into a question of personal discipline. And it turns out when you remove necessity, a lot of people have a real hard time doing the best thing on discipline alone.

Not just unit tests, not even just integration tests, but, is there a user that found this useful? At all? How many users? How many use cases? How hard has it been subjected to the blows of the real world?As AI makes some of the other issues less important, the ones that remain become more important. It is completely impossible to ask an LLM to produce a code base that has been used by millions of people for five years. Such things will still have value.The idea that the near-future is an AI powered wonderland of everyone getting custom bespoke code that does exactly what they want and everything is peachy is overlooking this problem. Even a (weakly) superhuman AI can't necessarily anticipate what the real world may do to a code base. Even if I can get an AI to make a bespoke photo editor, someone else's AI photo editor that has seen millions of person-years of usage is going to have advantages over my custom one that was just born.Of course not all code is like this. There is a lot of low-consequence, one-off code, with all the properties we're familiar with on that front, like, there are no security issues because only I will run this, bugs are of no consequence because it's only ever going to be run across this exact data set that never exposes them (e.g., the vast, vast array of bash scripts that will technically do something wrong with spaces in filenames but ran just fine because there weren't any).

If they don't have enough details to implement a solution, they will ask the client for details. If the developer decides to use an LLM to implement a solution, they have the ability to assess the end product.The problem is software developers cost money. A developer using an LLM may reduce the cost of development, but it is doubtful that the reduction in cost will be sufficient to justify personalized applications in many cases. Most of the cases where it would justify the cost would likely be in domains where custom software is in common use anyhow.Sure, you will see a few people using LLMs to develop personalized software for themselves. Yet these will be people who understand how to specify the problem they are trying to solve clearly, will have the patience to handle the quirks and bugs in the software they create, and may even enjoy the process. You may even have a few small and medium sized businesses hiring developers who use LLMs to create custom software. But I don't think you're going to see the wholesale adoption of personalized software.And that only considers the ability of people to specify the problem they are trying to solve.

Sure, it may complete tasks here and there, but at the price of increasing complexity from which it is difficult for both you and it to dig out.Most AI naysayers can't be bothered with the huge amount of work required to setup a project to be llm-friendly, they fail, and blame the tool.Even after the scaffolding, the best thing to do, at least for the projects you care (essentially anything that's not a prototype for quickly validating an idea) you should keep reading and following it line by line, and keep updating your scaffolding and documentation as you see it commit the same mistakes over and over. And part of scaffolding requires also to put the source code of your main dependencies. I have a _vendor directory with git subtrees for major dependencies. LLMs can check the code of the dependencies, the tests, and figure out what they are doing wrong much quicker.Last but not least, LLMs work better with certain patterns, such as TDD. So instead of \"implement X\", it's better to \"I need to implement X, but before we do so, let's setup a way for testing and tracking our progress against\". You can build an inspector for a virtual machine, you can setup e2es or other tests, or just dump line by line logs in some file. There's many approaches depending on the use case.In any case, getting real help for LLMs for authoring code (editing, patching, writing new features) is highly dependent on having good context, good setup (tests, making it write a plan for business requirements and one for implementation) and following and improving all these aspects as you progress.",

They started a series called “So Expensive”, detailing why various things were expensive, the first 4 videos in the series were: Caviar, Saffron, Rolexes and Horseshoe Crab Blood. Statistically, some tens of millions of people have organically had the thought of why the first 3 were expensive but zero people have even wondered why horseshoe crab blood was expensive. The 4th video was a way to test, of all the people who were willing to click on the first three, how many were willing to follow along to the 4th because of a trust in BI? The next 4 in the series was Vanilla, Silk, Louboutins & Scorpion Venom.Creating all content for acquisition is both too exhausting and also sub optimal for the reader because they want deeper stuff to follow as well. I suggest up to 1 in 3 acquisition articles if you can manage when starting out but then ramping down to no more than 1 in 10 fairly quickly or you burn out.",

Which turns this into a sensitive discussion about what one can glean about an author’s character traits based on their writing style and when the author in question is only a ‘public figure’ in the eyes of the niche collection of online enclaves who are even aware that Gwern exists it becomes tough to candidly critique his literary persona with the sort of freedom that one may have when talking about say, some guy who’s written for the Atlantic for 30 years and is further from the spaces where criticisms about his work are held.My criticisms about Gwern’s writing is not meant to be taken...ahem...personally in the sense that I don’t want to use Gwern as a subject for whatever literary critique I’m trying to proffer beyond how useful it is—and is presenting itself—as a fine case to help make whatever point I’m trying to make more clear about how Writing style is inextricable from and indicative of personality or lack thereof. And this is probably a part of what makes reading and writing such a profound experience.One of the most interesting remarks about Gwern’s writing is this comment [1]:> Everything I read from gwern has this misanthropic undertones. It's hard to put a finger on it exactly, but it grits me when I try reading him.— <https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42135302>While I can't agree with the entirety of `mola’s comment—I simply haven’t put that much thought into making as grave of an evaluation into Gwern’s character as such a judgement would demand, nor am I that interested in deliberating over such an evaluation—it still resonates with me as a reader and you’ll find in my comment downthread from `mola’s remark that it’s at least plausible that an affinity for self-expression and intellectualizing about the world doesn’t necessitate an interest in the rest of its inhabitants in a way that causes me not to find the thesis behind “First, make me care” to be coloured with a stroke of irony, considering who’s behind it.You say \"style is more important when you want to reach someone who hasn't heard of you.” I agree with that and I reckon that it’s still style that forms a non-trivial amount of how you identify with ‘who’ the author is once you’ve become familiar with they’re work and can set an expectation for why their ideas may be worthwhile to engage with in the first place. Again, Paul Graham’s writing has a style although no where to the degree that Maciej Cegłowski does. You can evince characteristics about each of them relative to how and what they write about. You can even speculate on ways that their respective personalities could lead to friction between them. [2]When we interrogate the “who” behind “who wrote” we are making judgements about the personality of the author and how that that makes us interested in their ideas. Today there are various non-literary mediums that give us a glimpse at a person’s personality with which we can anticipate whether it’s worth reading what they write. But if all you go by is their writing then how they write is about the only way for you to speculate about 'who' the author is and what they’re like as a person.There are probably holes in this line of reasoning but I don’t think the lines between writing style, personal appeal and the ability to appeal to readers through how you write—effectively signaling to your personality in the process!—are as distinct as I think you’re portraying them. What’s the opposite of orthogonal? Correlated?To end: Gwern’s writing lacks personality to me. This makes it hard to reconcile with the point he’s making in this article (which I agree with!) and my perception of his own writing (which invariably and perhaps even unfortunately invites speculation into any writer’s own personality).Again, please, Does Gwern have anything that sounds as striking as “Empires Without Farms: The Case of Venice” or was that example a tacit hat tip to Brett Devereaux’s work? I don’t think the guy is a misanthrope but I do sense a wall of text—both figuratively and literally—between he and I when engaging with his writing. He is evidently well and widely read and despite my dislike for the visual form of his website I think that it is still a solid technical display of hypertext for personal web design and information architecture.

Discussing one commands a look into the other, otherwise why bother with ‘art’ and ‘artists’ at all?[2] Those who are familiar with both Graham’s and Cegłowski’s writing can take a guess at who once called the other a “big ole weenis” in an exchange on this very site.",

One of them suddenly attracted massive attention worldwide, especially from Pakistan and Indonesia. According to the stats, 99% of the viewers were male. Millions and millions of views. For months, it sat in the top five French videos on YouTube. Ad revenue went through the roof, like three figures per day, for months, from that single video. None of the others on the channel saw anything remotely similar. It was baffling.Then I understood why. The automatic thumbnail generator had picked a frame from the exact middle of the two-minute video. It showed a close-up of a newborn heel prick test: a nurse firmly holding the baby’s heel and pricking it to collect a drop of blood for routine postnatal genetic screening. The thumbnail frame looked like a skin-colored cylinder grasped by a woman’s hand.Thankfully, the flood of comments, expressing disgust and horror at a medical procedure on a newborn after viewers had expected something entirely different, did not prevent the algorithm from enthusiastically recommending that thumbnail to a significant fraction of humanity.",

It is the writer's job to show the reader why they should be interested, why they should care.Infinite Jest is a also a good example of something which goes against TFA's point, it opens with a very sterile, impersonal, literal and completely disconnected first person narrative, he gives us nothing to care about.

Rather, I am attempting to explain things to my future self, who is intelligent and interested, but has forgotten. What I am doing is explaining why I decided what I did to myself and noting down everything I found interesting about it for future reference. I hope my other readers, whomever they may be, might find the topic as interesting as I found it, and the essay useful or at least entertaining–but the intended audience is my future self.— <https://gwern.net/about#target-audience>We can reconcile this with the purport of the writing of his that we’re discussing now—it’s a notice with his future self in mind. And we can compare and contrast the above quote and the aforementioned piece with some of PG’s writing which I find is meant to be public-facing literature at full bloom. [1][2]I think there’s a difference between 'writing for my future self’ and ‘writing with the public in mind’. Howard & Barton (1986) would argue that they represent separate stages of the writing process and I agree with that and prefer writing that is primed for the latter form. [3] I associate the maxim “First, make me care” with the latter as well and by-and-large feel like Gwern’s writing—that which I’ve come across most frequently—is geared toward the former form. Which I’m sure serves him well, as well as I’m sure it’s served well to those who enjoy his work. I’m yet to determine whether that’s a good or bad thing.As I’ve cited earlier, some consider Gwern's writing to evoke a sort of misanthropy. But hey...I’m sure there’s someone else to say the same about Paul Graham and his stuff. I’ll withhold judgement against the both of them on that matter—for now—lest I get caught unprepared to be deemed one myself.[1] <https://www.paulgraham.com/field.html>[2] <https://www.paulgraham.com/useful.html>[3] <https://search.worldcat.org/title/13329813>",

There's a lot of content that exists to basically confirm what the viewer wants to hear, not tell them that their doctor is a better judge than they are.This is happening everywhere on social media. See the explosion in content dedicated to telling people that every little thing is a symptom of ADHD or that being a little socially awkward or having unusual interests is a reliable indicator for Autism.There's a growing problem in the medical field where patients show up to the clinic having watched hundreds of hours of TikTok and YouTube videos and having already self-diagnosing themselves with multiple conditions. Talking them out of their conclusions can be really hard when the provider only has 40 minutes but the patient has a parasocial relationship with 10 different influencers who speak to them every day through videos.",

You want me to update your shopping list?\"or\"The dentist office just sent out a reminder - you have an appointment on Thursday that's not on the calendar. It conflicts with your daily standup. You want me to create a task for you to resolve it?\"Its using:\n- AWS CDK\n- Telegram as primary chat interface\n- Trello/Jira/Something Custom\n- Integrations into GoogleCalendar and GMail\n- Ability to use Claude/OpenAI and different modelsFWIW, if someone figures out how to create a reliable \"secretary in a box\" that I don't have to DIY but doesn't scream data-collection-watering-hole (facebook) I'd _happily_ pay $200 / mo for it. ;-)",

Access to my TODO list on Apple Notes and basically remind my ADHD brain that I ought to be doing something and not let it slip because it is uninteresting.3. Have access to all models via API keys I configure and maintain a \"research journal\" of all the things I go to LLMs for - \"research of bike that fits my needs\" whatever and figure out if there needs to be a TODO about them and add if I say yes.4. View my activity as a professional coach and nudge me into action \"Hey you wanted to do this at work this year, but you haven't begun.. may be it is time you look at it Thursday at 3 PM?\"5. View my activity as a mental health coach and nudge me like \"hey you're researching this, that and blah while X, Y and Z are pending. Want me to record the state of this research so you can get back to doing X, Y and Z?\" or Just talk to me like a therapist would.6. Be my spaghetti wall. When a new idea pops into my head, I send this secretary a message, and it ruminates over it like I would and matures that idea in a directory that I can review and obsess over later when there is time..As you see, this is quite personal in nature, I dont want hosted LLMs to know me this deeply.

That was one of the best proposals I think I’ve ever written.I’ve been using cowork to help organize my downloads folder, which had 1500 files and I just didn’t have the patience to organize them.So maybe the differences with Claude bought not as big because I’m able to vibe code my way into things like like integrations and other things that I’ve already been using?For the app that I wrote to help manage my business, I exposed everything over MCP so I’m able to do things like timesheets and adding and removing people and purchase orders and all that stuff using MCP. So which is why I’m already kind of feeling the magic with my existing stuff maybe?The one thing in ClawdBot’s favor is the scheduled stuff maybe?",

Then, QKV lets you rebuild the meaning from user-provided tokens, so if you know which words to use, you can totally change the behavior of your so-far benign LLM.There was also paper about sleeper agents and I am by no way a doomer but the LLM security is greatly underestimated, and the prompt injection (which is impossible to solve with current generation of LLMs) is just the tip of the iceberg.

Not only that, DOM, JS and CSS also serves as a sandbox of rendering standard, and the capability based design is also seen throughout many browsers even starting with the Netscape Navigator.Locking down features to have a unified experience is what a browser should do, after all, no matter the performance. Of course there are various vendors who tried to break this by introducing platform specific stuff, but that's also why IE, and later Edge (non-chrome) died a horrible deathThere are external sandbox escapes such as Adobe Flash, ActiveX, Java Applet and Silverlight though, but those external escapes are often another sandbox of its own, despite all of them being a horrible one...But with the stabilization of asm.js and later WebAssembly, all of them is gone with the wind.Sidenote: Flash's scripting language, ActionScript is also directly responsible for the generational design of Java-ahem-ECMAScript later on, also TypeScript too.",

But I do think a large amount of these can indeed run in the browser, especially all the ones that essentially just want to live-update and execute code, or run shells on top of a mounted file system. You can actually do all of this in the user's browser very efficiently. There are two things you lose though: collaboration (you can do it, but it becomes a distributed problem if you don't have a central server) and working in the background (you need to pause all work while the user's tab is suspended or closed).So if you can work within the constraints there are a lot of benefits you get as a platform: latency goes down a lot, performance may go up depending on user hardware (usually more powerful than the type of VM you'd use for this), bandwidth can go down significantly if you design this right, and your uptime and costs as a platform will improve if you don't need to make sure you can run thousands of VMs at once (or pay a premium for a platform that does it for you)[1]All that said I'm not sure trying to put an entire OS or something like WebContainers in the user's browser is the way, I think you need to build a slightly custom runtime for this type of local agentic environment. But I'm convinced it's the best way to get the smoothest user experience and smoothest platform growth. We did this at Framer to be able to recompile any part of a website into React code at 60+ frames per second, which meant less tricks necessary to make the platform both feel snappy and be able to publish in a second.[1] For big model providers like OpenAI and Anthropic there's an interesting edge they have in that they run a tremendous amount of GPU-heavy loads and have a lot of CPUs available for this purpose.",

In 2024 alone, Google reported 75 zero-day exploits that break out of their browser's sandbox.Browsers are the worst security paradigm. They have tens of millions of lines of code, far more than operating system kernels. The more lines of code, the more bugs. They include features you don't need, with no easy way to disable them or opt-in on a case-by-case basis. The more features, the more an attacker can chain them into a usable attack. It's a smorgasbord of attack surface. The ease with which the sandbox gets defeated every year is proof.So why is everyone always using browsers, anyway? Because they mutated into an application platform that's easy to use and easy to deploy. But it's a dysfunctional one. You can't download and verify the application via signature, like every other OS's application platform. There's no published, vetted list of needed permissions. The \"stack\" consists of a mess of RPC calls to random remote hosts, often hundreds if not thousands required to render a single page. If any one of them gets compromised, or is just misconfigured, in any number of ways, so does the entire browser and everything it touches. Oh, and all the security is tied up in 350 different organizations (CAs) around the world, which if any are compromised, there goes all the security. But don't worry, Google and Apple are hard at work to control them (which they can do, because they control the application platform) to give them more control over us.This isn't secure, and there's really no way to secure it. And Google knows that. But it's the instrument making them hundreds of billions of dollars.",

(To get the second window to run its test you need to enter aWorker.postMessage(\"go\")  in the console)The design was using  IndexedDB to make a very simple filesystem, and a transmittable APIThe source of the worker shows the simplicity of it once set up.  https://fingswotidun.com/tests/messageAPI/testWorker.js in total is just    importScripts(\"MessageTunnel.js\"); // the only dependency of the worker\n  \n    onmessage = function(e) {\n     console.log(`Worker: Message  received from main script`,e.data);\n     if (e.data.apiDefinition) {\n       installRemoteAPI(e.data.apiDefinition,e.ports[0])    \n     }\n     if (e.data==\"go\") {\n       go();\n       return;\n     } \n  }\n  \n  async function go() {\n      const thing = await testAPI.echo(\"hello world\")\n      console.log(\"got a thing back \",thing)\n  \n      //fs is provided by installRemoteAPI  \n      const rootInfo = await fs.stat(\"/\");\n      console.log(`stat(\"/\") returned `,rootInfo)\n    \n      // fs.readDir returns an async iterator that awaits on an iterator on the host side \n      const dir = await fs.readDir(\"/\")\n      for await (const f of dir) {\n        const stats = await fs.stat(\"/\"+f.name);\n        console.log(\"file  \" +f,stats)\n      }\n    \n  }\n\n\nI distinctly remember adding a Serviceworker so you could fetch URLs from inside the filesystem, so I must have a more recent version sitting around somewhere.It wouldn't take too much to have a $PATH analog and a command executor that launched a worker from a file on the system if it found a match existed on the $PATH.

While slow phosphor tubes do display a static image, most CRT systems used extremely fast phosphors; they release the majority of the light within a millisecond of the beam hitting them.  If you take a really fast exposure of a CRT display (say 1/100,000th of a second) you don't see the whole image on the photograph - only the most recently few drawn lines glow.

First, I believe they would have been easier to make. From what I've read rectangles have more stress at the corners. Rounding the corners reduces that but it is still more than circles have. With circles they could have more easily made bigger CRTs.Second, there is no aspect ratio thus avoiding the whole problem of picking an aspect ratio.Electronically the signals to the XY deflectors to scan a spiral out from the center (or in from the edge if you prefer) on a circle are as easy to make as the signals to to scan in horizontal lines on a rectangle.As far as I can tell that would have been fine up until we got computers and wanted to use TV CRTs as computer displays.

On almost every service call, I'd show up and 95% of the time, without fail, they'd either be watching Fox News, CNN, or CNBC. It was quite depressing to see 24/7 news stations had completely consumed their lives and became the majority of topics of conversation while I was there.I eventually quit the job. I decided I didn't want to be a part of making our society worse by installing these devices that were causing manufactured outrage, hate, and selective truth telling.Soon after I left, I found a book while thrifting that came out in 1978 called \"Four Arguments for the Elimination of Television\" by Jerry Mander. I laughed at the title and couldn't believe someone was already arguing for the detriments of TV before I was born. It's very well written and the points he makes are still relevant today.From the wikipedia - https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Four_Arguments_for_the_Elimina...Mander believes that \"television and democratic society are incompatible\" due to television removing all of society's senses except for seeing and hearing. The author states that television makes it so that people have no common sense which leads to...being \"powerless to reject the camera's line of sight, reset the stage, or call on our own sensory apparatus to correct the doctored sights and sounds the machine delivers\".Mander's four arguments in the book to eliminate television are:1. that telecommunication removes the sense of reality from people,2. television promotes capitalism,3. television can be used as a scapegoat, and4. that all three of these issues negatively work together.",

PAL televisions (the color TV standard in Europe) actually do store one full horizontal scanline at a time, before any of it is drawn on the screen. This is due to a clever encoding used in this format where the TV actually needs to average two successive scan lines (phase-shifted compared to each other) to draw them. Supposedly this cancels out some forms of distortion. It is quite fascinating this was even possible with analogue technology. The line is stored in a delay line for 64 microseconds.\nSee e.g.: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bsk4WWtRx6M",

From https://www.tvtechnology.com/opinions/hdtv-from-1925-to-1994In the United States in 1935, the Radio Corporation of America demonstrated a 343-line television system. In 1936, two committees of the Radio Manufacturers Association (RMA), which is now known as the Consumer Electronics Association, proposed that U.S. television channels be standardized at a bandwidth of 6 MHz, and recommended a 441-line, interlaced, 30 frame-per-second television system. The RF modulation system proposed in this recommendation used double-sideband, amplitude-modulated transmission, limiting the video bandwidth it was capable of carrying to 2.5 MHz. In 1938, this RMA proposal was amended to employ vestigial-sideband (VSB) transmission instead of double sideband. In the vestigial-sideband approach, only the upper sidebands-those above the carrier frequency-plus a small segment or vestige of the lower sidebands, are transmitted. VSB raised the transmitted video bandwidth capability to 4.2 MHz. Subsequently, in 1941, the first National Television Systems Committee adopted the vestigial sideband system using a total line rate of 525 lines that is used in the United States today.",

But taking this site as a random sample, the \"good\" ones are a vanishing minority.  For every subtle Invader mosaic high on a building, you get dozens of effortless name tags that just wreck the look of a place.Adding frustration is the fact that there's no way to effectively dissuade people from doing this.  You don't want to fine, jail or otherwise ruin the lives of thousands of kids to get them to stop.  You just want them to stop spraypainting shit.  It's really the only example I can think of where I'd support some form of corporal punishment.  Catch kids in the act, 20 lashes in the town square to convince them not to do it again, then set them to work with a wire brush until they can demonstrate that it's back to the state they found it.  Even still, I can't imagine it would really do much to dissuade.It's a shame.",

The walls of single family homes in suburban neighborhoods don't really compare. There's much more of a shared sense of \"ours\" in a city than there is out in the country, where everything's fenced off in little discrete boxes of land, each with someone's name on it.

That way, whenever you're asked for Ctrl, which is all the time, you can always safely hit Cmd with no need for extra configuration. You can then remap various things in KDE Shortcuts to be more Mac like, like Cmd+Q, Cmd+Tab, Cmd+`, etc. (The only thing lacking is the Ctrl v. Cmd separation in a terminal, so I manually remapped all the Ctrl sequences in my terminal emulator to Win sequences, which matches my hardware Ctrl key. So, like on a Mac, Cmd+C works to copy, Ctrl+C is the escape code.)This works for a Mac keyboard. For a Windows keyboard, you'd have to shuffle Alt -> Ctrl, Win -> Alt, and Ctrl -> Win. There are settings for this in xkb. (KDE surfaces these in its Keyboard settings panel.)Keyboard layouts/shortcuts are a huge pain point with Linux. xkb is geriatric, and acts as such. Compose keys are flaky and inconsistent across applications. Virtually all Linux software is going to default to some idiosyncratic take on Windows shortcuts, often without much by way of customisability.

Everyone uses the centralized did:plc because it's the one way to really make it function. Until very recently, everyone used the centralized Bluesky AppView - and even now, well over 99% do. Bluesky will say things like \"the protocol is locked open\", but Bluesky could decide to shut off their firehose at anytime (leaving third parties cut off) and could decide to stop taking incoming data from third parties (leaving anyone on non-Bluesky servers cut off from basically everyone).In a lot of ways, Bluesky is more like Twitter a decade or so ago. It offers APIs that third parties can use to build off of - but at any time, Bluesky could shut down those APIs. Back then, you could read the Twitter firehose and store the tweets and create your own app view with your own front-end if you wanted. Tweets would need to be sent to the Twitter APIs, but that's not really different than your third-party PDS server sending them to Bluesky if you want anyone else to read them.You aren't open if someone controls the vast majority of a system because at any time they can decide \"why are we doing this open thing? we could probably force the <1% of people elsewhere to migrate to our service if we cut off interoperability.\" Google Talk (GChat) offered XMPP federation and a lot of people bought into the platform because it was open. At some point, Google realized that the promise of openness had served its purpose and closed it off.And it's important to think about the long-run here. Twitter was that benevolent dictator for a long time. Bluesky is still early and looking to grow - when they want people building off their system, giving them engagement, ideas, and designs they can copy. We're around year-5 of Bluesky. A decade from now after Bluesky builds its popularity on the back of \"we're open and decentralized\" while making decentralization extremely difficult, will that change? If Bluesky gets to a few hundred million users and then a third party starts looking like a potential threat, maybe they'll cut that off before they have genuine competition.Maybe that won't happen with Bluesky. Maybe their investors won't care about the potential for a pay day. But if they have control (either through centralization like did:plc or by controlling the vast majority of the network), there will always be the potential for them to break interoperability. If they start monetizing Bluesky, why should they keep hosting, processing, and serving all that data for third party clients they can't monetize? Why shouldn't they stop federating with third parties before a third party becomes competition?",

Real world implementations then associate keys with nodes using a TOFU scheme (which makes perfect sense) and if the domain ever changes hands (thus the key changes) all sorts of stuff breaks in frustrating ways.Even worse are the assumptions that a given node will never migrate between DNS entries or appear at multiple DNS entries simultaneously. In practice this comes up all the time because people regularly stand a node up on a cheap VPS using an off the cuff domain. Then some time later they either forget to renew the domain or have second thoughts about it.While I appreciate that it's always easy to criticize things in hindsight there's no lack of aggravating real world problems related to the way AP models identity.",

People are eager to move off because a lot of users really really don't like bluesky PBC leadership but it's a matter of waiting for these third party communities to reach critical mass.- Relay infra is already pretty much decentralised. Lots of people still rely on the main relay but it's trivial to use a third party relay and there's more of them than you can count.- There are a lot of really high quality third party clients and afaict a lot of users do actually use third party clients but there's basically no metric for tracking these stats.- Appviews are expensive currently and there's work on making them easier to host but there's already one \"full\" alternative appview for bluesky.- There are a lot non-bluesky apps/services that are genuinely high quality experiences and they are gaining their own communities.The main technical barrier to true decentralisation outside of improving UX is introducing other did:methods and/or spreading trust of did:plc across the community (ex: clustered via raft or paxos across major operators) but there's just not a reason to pursue this over the other fires that need fighting in the ecosystem right now (and keeping did diversity low reduces another source of complexity the space just doesn't need to tackle yet).--------------TLDR: it is intentional because the goal is to in order of priorities:1. get the architecture for eventual decentralisation right.2. make it exist.3. make it good.4. make it easy to use for normal people.5. build community.6. focus on decentralisation.Decentralisation in theory is the first priority but in practice it's the last priority.

The docs say to start one of them first and wait for it to fully sync. It prints a timeout error for every block, saying the other chain node software was unreachable, and is estimated to catch up to current block height in about 200 years, which can't be right. Maybe I need to run both nodes at once contrary to the explicit instructions in the docs which say not to do so.I wouldn't be surprised if half of all blockchains were vulnerable to some kind of trivial double–spend attack because it's not possible that all the complexity has eyes on it.Edit: you're supposed to download a 2GB JSON file containing the state as of the last migration.The normal way to set up most blockchain nodes these days is to rsync someone else's node's working directory.

Both borrowed heavily from the VMS code base.Windows 7 later on in its patch cycle was more stable in my opinion.  Each time a version gets stable they make a new version full of new bloat, bugs, stability issues, crap most people did not want or need.  Near the end of that versions life cycle it gets more stable and debloat scripts work better, then the cycle repeats and new junk comes out.  Stability seems to leap-frog.  Win 7 decent, 8 crap, 10 decent, 11 crap.  This was a thing long ago with Unix kernel versions.

One begins to suspect that the \"reductive\" method of science - the sort of physics- or mathematics-type \"reduce the variables of the problem until we can isolate effects\" approach - isn't particularly well-suited to dealing with biological systems. You see it in bioinformatics as well - we've sequenced the genomes for many organisms, and have learned a lot from doing so, but we're also learning the limits of that approach pretty strongly - the organism isn't defined just by its 'code', but its environment; the presence, distribution, and concentration of various chemicals; etc. I suspect as we move more towards the \"biological\" century here we're going to have to readjust how we approach things to start trying to find those synergistic effects earlier in the process, rather than pull everything down to its constituent parts and then experimenting pairwise with various combos. I get the difficulties in doing that, but I feel like we've repeatedly found the stuff we've discarded as irrelevant to the problem (\"things that are not in the visual wavelength the eye perceives\") in fact do wind up being relevant (wider full-spectrum light has effects outside the mere spatial perception of objects).",

The lamp used a carbon filament in an environment that prevented the evaporation of the filament.With such a lamp, one can make a tradeoff between energy efficiency and the content of healthy near infrared light, by a judicious choice of the frequency cutoff for the window through which light exits the lamp.Even with enough near-infrared light, the efficiency should be a few times higher than for classic incandescent lamps, though not as good as for LED lamps. Presumably, one could reach an efficiency similar to that of the compact fluorescent lamps (which was about half of that of LED lamps), for such an incandescent lamp that also provides near-infrared light.",

I am also skeptical of any effect in the retina lasting 6 weeks, with no fading.Consider that people are often exposed to much more infrared light outdoors, so \"worked under a relatively dim incandescent lamp\" is not a particularly novel stimulus.

The difference is that you need a much lower electrical current through it for maintaining the temperature, because most of the heat is not lost away, like in a classic lamp. The fact that you need a much smaller electrical current for the same temperature is the source of the greater energy efficiency.Only if you had used the same electrical current as in a classic lamp, the lamp would have overheated and the filament destroyed, but you have no reason to do that, like you also do not want to use in a classic lamp a current higher than nominal, which would overheat and destroy it.",

Every day I turned on the music in my office and coded with the T-amp playing. I would have told you at the time that, indeed, it sounded amazing.Some time later I built a tube amplifier (The Darling [2], in case anyone cares—I've since built perhaps a dozen more).When I brought it into the office and swapped it out for the T-amp, the change was sublime but immediately noticeable. I hate to fall back on audiophile terminology but it's the best I have for the experience: I was suddenly aware of \"listening fatigue\" that had been a component of the T-amp. I hadn't even known it had been fatiguing until I heard the tube amp in its place for days on end.With the loss of color fidelity and the flickering issue, I'm embarrassed to say that incandescent is starting to look good to me again.I might, as an experiment, replace only those lights that we turn on in the evening when we are relaxing, reading.[1] https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Class-T_amplifier[2] https://www.diyaudio.com/community/threads/darling-1626-amp.... and https://imgur.com/gallery/oh-darling-tube-amplifier-Lq2Sx",

It does a decent job of preventing further damage. If I have some rusty parts sometimes I'll throw them in a glass jar, soak 'em with WD-40, shake them around, let them sit for a day or so, and then scrub them with a wire brush.

Now, I think WD-40 is a brand name that can be trusted to work well more often than most alternatives but that is more about process than recipe (I would think).I've long thought that every restaurant/bakery/etc could publish their full internal cookbooks and not see a drop in sales. People don't buy it because they are incapable (or think they are) of making something, they do it because it's faster, they don't have all the ingredients, they don't have the time, they don't have the skill, the list goes on. I bet I could give the instructions, the equipment, and the ingredients to people and they'd still choose to buy it. Sure, you might lose a tiny bit of sales to \"home bakers\" [0] but I think it'd be eclipsed by people that saw/read/heard about the cookbook (maybe never even saw it) and that was enough \"marketing\" to get them in the door.I've always found \"secret knowledge\" to be a little silly.

But with Rust there is a second layer of guarantees that come from its design, around things like concurrency, nil pointers, data races, memory safety, and more.The fewer category errors a language or framework introduces, the more successful LLMs will be at interacting with it. Developers enjoy freedom and many ways to solve problems, but LLMs thrive in the presence of constraints.

Even as the US takes actions that (in their minds) are ruining that idea, instead of acting, they just complain and condemn.Even if tomorrow they decided to actual work together and invest in their own capabilities it would be decades before they would be free of the US defense sector and they know it and it's why they are so resistant to the idea.

Obviously, you need the nukes themselves, and a reliable delivery mechanism. Neither are cheap. Preferably, you want second-strike capability, which is kind of tricky. And you want some way of balancing things so that the enemy does not take a chance on that second-strike capability and nuke you first anyway. Then you need something to use them for. At the time, the targets would probably have been ports in the Baltic states, then (involuntary) parts of the Soviet union and likely starting points for the hypothetical Soviet invasion fleet. Could we really stomach the idea of killing a few thousand Estonian civilians, probably not too happy about being used as stepping stones by the Soviets? For most military targets, there are better weapons.Of course, it has later been argued that by entering into various more or less hidden agreements with the US, we made ourselves nuclear targets anyway, with no formal guarantees whatsoever to show for it...",

And in almost all cases, sufficient human attention would also have identified the critical bug - so human attention is the primary bottleneck here.

It's been a couple years, so if it really helps then we should see it by now.So, either LLM-assisted coding is not delivering the benefits some thought it would, or Microsoft, despite being an early investor in OpenAI, is not using it much internally on things that really matter to them (like Windows).

And this one I can't fix, I can't shift my desktop out of OneDrive.MS's strategy at this point is that Windows is a loss leader to get people onto the subscriptions for Office and OneDrive. So when the Windows team releases bugs that break usage of those services, forcing people off them onto alternative solutions, the guy in charge of those updates really needs to be answering some tough questions.[1] I've now got SyncThing handling this.",

The issues are more subtle, the volume is greater, and there is no human reasoning chain to follow when debugging.So you combine that with a company that has staff in low skill regions, and uses outsourcing, and while there might be some high skill teams that got a speed up, the org is structured in a way that its irrelevant.",

Suddenly my career stagnated. I had managed before, I had led before, I had delivered results before. But my growth came grinding to a halt. I was following all of these tips and tricks while overlooking the implicit thing - deliver value.In many, the same ways, I’ve become wary of any company beliefs, values, or guidelines that aren’t clearly working towards making the company money.

If you did UI work you would work with another UI/UX manager.The minimum timespan to get anything done was measured in quarters. You could expect to have to spend more time scheduling meetings and following up with all your different managers by a factor of 10X or more than time spent doing anything related to code.Contrast this with another employer I had who was very clear about the fact that we were not a big tech company and we were not going to structure our teams like one. We kept team units small and made them work together as a unit, not a disparate collection of managers that had to be appeased. We shipped a lot and we shipped fast.We need to stop trying to use complicated and divided management structures everywhere.

I miss being able to turn on some tunes, code for a few hours, and call it good for the day. At the same time, I have always naturally fell into leadership positions I think mainly because I like helping people make better decisions. As an IC, I despised broken processes, bad decisions from product, and overall poor management. As an engineering manager, I have some amount of control over these things and I hope those I manage, as well as our users, have benefited from me being in this role.A few examples of things I heavily influenced:- reduction in investment of time, effort, and cost going to offshore engineering. We’ve reduced bugs and effort from our engineers in coordinating between disparate time zones.- advocacy of a design system shared between design and dev teams. We now have one.- reduction in the amount of meetings our devs are expected to attend weekly, increasing time they can spend building- heavily advocating to reduce number of clicks for our users to get where they need to be, benefit UX greatly- better defined incident management processIt’s not perfect though, the amount of control I have is still limited, and I am in meetings basically all day sometimes.While I will say that would have sounded like hell to me a couple of years ago as an IC, I have been able to sway the direction of the company meaningfully in ways that feel ultimately more impactful than what I could have done jamming on some code in the same amount of time. The cost of doing so is a little more stress, but hey I get to do so from the comfort of my home and I’m allowed a good amount of schedule flexibility outside of some specific meetings each day.

'You are screwed no matter what you do' is not a good way to motivate people to action. People have heard this all before,  and don't trust it. You can only cry wolf so many times with apocolyptic stories.In the UK after a prolonged drought in Southern England the news announced something like,  'The aquifer is so depleted that it will take years to recover'. Then came 3 months of the wettest summer on record. I remember a local fishing tackle shop going out of business because noone could fish due to flooding! The acqifer filled in 3 months.Then I saw a village in Southern Spain where the acquifer dried up. Someone realised that the Moors had built an ancient water harvesting system in the hills, at least hundreds of years before,   and because of rural depopulation the knowledge and labour to maintain them had been lost. The abundance of water was not natural,  it was human created,  and then human lost.I think the final problem I wanted to speak about is the 'it's the end users fault' problem. I pay for my water, through water rates (a tax on the property I live in). Others have water meters. The company that gets that money has to supply me water, and take away my sewage. The company used to be a public utility, but was privatised when I was young.  When there is a drought they tell me I should shower rather than bath, they ban the use of hosepipes! They tell me to buy low flush toilets and more efficient washing machines. But they never share that pain,  they still make massive profits for their shareholders. The private water companies in the UK have not built a single reservoir since privatisation in 1989. To be fair most of the water infrastructure is Victorian. The infrastructure that filed reservoirs was left unmaintained. A staggering amount of water leaks from pipes in the road.  Their solution is for me to use less water,  so they can continue to get rich. And they know that they can fail to invest forever,  and the government will have to bail them out. I suspect this is the problem in other places too.",

This is natures sponge, it absorbed rain to reduce flooding, and then kept the rivers higher in times of drought.In WW2 and the decade or so after,  the owners were forced to 'improve' the land or have it confiscated by WARAG. The solution was to drain it, so sheep could graze,  turn flatter bits into field etc. This was a justifyiable response to the U-boat menace that tried to starve Britain  out of the war. The sponge was destroyedThere is now a greater understanding that the sponge is good.  There have been small projects to block drains and reflood bits,  that then start to sponge again.But greater roll out meets innevitable resistance. The hill may have a nominal landowner,  but it may also have many smaller surrounding properties that have grazing rights on the hill. Now some environmentalists turn up offering to flood their grazing, on a farm that is already marginally profitable... and so we each an impasse.Downstream are millions of people who want drinking water but don't want flooding. The solution of them paying the 'commoners' to use their grazing as sponge never comes up.In the lowlands are small rivers that were 'canalised' in the same era. A little stream was dug 6 feet deeper and straightened. This dried the fields for grazing and cultivation.  Now people want to restore these streams for both habitat and flood control reasons. Often this is simply by inaction from the people meant to maintain the canal. There is zero talk of ongoing payments to the people who lose fields through this! They are supposed to just put up with it!I suspect this story has analogues in many other places.",

          "content": "The challenges will be great and felt by all in some way.I live downstream from W.L.Gore in Maryland, the creator of this miracle substance, and a few years ago I myself began asking questions. I came to learn that they just dumped the stuff in the stream for decades and that stream is the source of my family's water via the town system. I had my water tested and came back at 70 ppt of which I then spoke to some doctors. This inspired me to write up and speak before the political board of my town and they did not believe me. Hilariously however someone knew because they stopped publishing PFA numbers in our water reports in 2022 but as a result of my speaking a few months later they brought in Inframark Corp who runs our town water and sewer. After they spoke to the town board at the meeting the town board was no longer smiling nor doubting my words. They were told that they must filter the drinking water and the operation will capex at about 4 MM USD with an opex for filters of around 2 MM USD annually. The town board was floored, but wait there's more, Inframark then told the board that they also must filter the sewer too since it must be removed as liquid products we use have pfas as well as RO systems which just re-concentrate it back into waste water. This sewer system capex was quoted at 10MM USD minimum and no opex stated since the plant already runs and filters costs were not known at the moment.My story is real world for nearly the entire East Coast of the USA but since the problem cannot be seen few know about it or even concern about it.  A town close to me, Newark DE, just announced a few months back going to spend tens of millions to filter their water with taxes ballooning from that and more. While a town to my West stated needing to spend about 20 MM USD to filter theirs. This is an absolute issue and I'd wager, polymarket conveniently makes it easy now, that this post ages well with time, or maybe I should say unwell. I have also been speaking with a lawyer in a big state that is running a class action and his information of course should be blasted on the news as more and more folks continue to consume liquids from plastic containers. Veritasium did a great piece on it a while back too but I have yet to have my own blood tested. For perspective I immediately bought a PFA specific filter and I installed it by extending our existing 3 stage to a 4 stage kitchen water tap at a cost of 600 USD for supplies. I then bought a whole house PFA filter a few months later and installed it too, costing me about 2000 USD in supplies, it is the size of a large compressed air canister so room is needed. I have so much more on this PFA topic but I am already going on too long. Your health doesn't matter until it does and no pill is going to filter this stuff from your organs.So the problem from the post then becomes: the water that we do have to drink probably isn't safe either.This leads me to question how many other chemicals we continue to \"create\" that in time will too show health impacts to many. We are certainly leaving our mark in this layer of soil for some future species to find and ask their own questions about us, such as how smart we really could have been given what they dig up.Stay Healthy!",

If we had Star Trek transporter technology we could in fact solve world hunger. We could take the excess bananas grown in Colombia and drop them outside the doors of hungry people in Nigeria. But we don't. It is very expensive and difficult to transport food and water from one place to another. The world has sent Africa $1.5T over the last 50 years, and yet the number of undernourished people has almost tripled in that time, from 100M to 282M as of 2022. Why?1. Corruption. I saw this first hand. For every $1M sent into Africa, a very large proportion is confiscated by tribes, gangs, militia, and the government. You can send all the excess food in the world, but there are thousands of people between production and the hungry person who is eager to violently steal it.2. Africa's population is booming. Thanks, in part, to food aid. Half of Nigeria doesn't have access to toilets. 40% doesn't have electricity. 25% doesn't have running water. Their fertility rate is 5.2 children per woman. We are unintentionally propping up a future catastrophe.3. Food aid has destroyed local farming and food production. Locals cannot compete with free.4. Equitable allocation is impossible. There is no hunger score above each person's head. Even if there were, there is no supply chain anywhere in the world which can reliably and repeatedly deliver the necessary food aid to each person in the deepest African jungles. We rely on distribution hubs which are sparse, poorly run, intermittent, and subject to temperature and humidity extremes. This means food perishes fast unless it is ultra processed and packed for durability. Basically army rations. Even those expire after some time. Meaning we can't just take the Colombian bananas and send them around the world. Only certain foods work, and they need to undergo expensive and specialised processing. This entire supply chain is far more expensive than you can imagine.I will close with my own opinion. While the world could sustain a higher population, it is clear to me that it will result in diminishing quality of life for everyone.

I'm sure it would be even more dropping now.The problem is, the Great Lakes aren't just some big lakes with juicy fresh water that can be spent as desired. They are also international shipping lanes. They make it so that de facto Detroit, Chicago, and a whole bunch of other cities and places are ocean ports. Ocean ports are very, very valuable. There are also numerous other port facilities all along the great lakes, often relatively in the middle of nowhere but doing something economically significant. This is maintained by very, very large and continual dredging operations to keep these lanes open. Dropping the water levels would destroy these ports and make the dredging operations go from expensive to impossible.So, getting large quantities of water out of the Great Lakes to go somewhere isn't just a matter of \"the people who control it don't want to do that\", which is still true, and a big obstacle on its own.

The normal reason to use the Mercator projection in these situations is (a) it’s what people are used to and (b) it preserves angles so if you zoom in on a street then up will still be north and roads that are at right angles in the real world appear to be at right angles on the map. The latter property is pretty desirable and hard to achieve without doing some weird transition between projections as you zoom. This matters more for Europe (and I suppose parts of British Colombia) where there is a high population density at latitudes that are pretty extreme in much of the world.I think Apple Maps has a pretty reasonable compromise here of transitioning from a globe to Mercator as you zoom, but this is a less nice UI with a mouse as you need to click to rotate the globe instead of pointing and zooming only. I don’t think there’s anything in this data that would make that unachievable – you just need to reproject the vector data a bit as you zoom out – but it takes some tricky mathematics to get right and so hasn’t been done yet.",

Master of Orion 2 was not bad either, but it was nowhere near\nas addictive and the gameplay was also more convoluted and slower.(Sometimes semi-new games are also ok such as Warcraft 3. I am not\nsaying ALL new games are bad, but it seems as if games were kind of\ndumbed down to be more like a video to watch, with semi-few interactive\nelements as you watch it.

Having a powerful general purpose microcontroller to experiment with is a design goal of the product.That said, ANC Bluetooth earbuds are not menial products. Doing ANC properly is very complicated. It’s much harder than taking the input from a microphone, inverting the signal, and feeding it into the output. There’s a lot of computation that needs to be done continuously.Using a powerful microcontroller isn’t a failure, it’s a benefit of having advanced semiconductor processes. Basically anything small and power efficient on a modern process will have no problem running at tens of MHz speeds. You want modern processes for the battery efficiency and you get speed as a bonus.The speed isn’t wasted, either. Higher clock speeds means lower latency. In a battery powered device having an MCU running at 48MHz may seem excessive until you realize that the faster it finishes every unit of work the sooner it can go to sleep. It’s not always about raw power.Modern earbuds are complicated. Having a general purpose MCU to allow software updates is much better than trying to get the entire wireless stack, noise cancellation, and everything else completely perfect before spinning out a custom ASIC.We’re very fortunate to have all of this at our disposal. The groveling about putting powerful microcontrollers into small things ignores the reality of how hard it is to make a bug-free custom ASIC and break even on it relative to spending $0.10 per unit on a proven microcontroller manufacturer at scale.",

I'm just waking up so I've only skimmed the paper so far, but I suspect the results would differ depending on which of us was fronting.We've noticed that each of us integrates not just sensory information differently, but we also seem to be \"wired\" differently.For instance, we are AuDHD, and I, the primary host, lean strongly to the autism behavioral side, my co-host is somewhere between, and a secondary host leans strongly to the ADHD behavioral side. Things that are easy for me can be hard for another.We also experience senses very differently. There have been many times where one of us can smell something strongly, switch, and the other can't smell it at all.This affects other senses as well. When I watch a 24 fps movie at a theater, for about the first 10 minutes, all I see is a strobing of still images before I finally adapt and see motion. My co-host sees continuous motion right from the start. This may relate to the temporal binding window discussed in the paper as a motivation for their research.Our working hypothesis since we were finally diagnosed has been that identity is, at least in part, an integration of both sensory information as well as how strongly various brain regions are activated by whichever identity or identities are most active at a particular time.Lastly, we have the ability to \"take control\" over just part of the body. For example, for whatever reason, the motion of stirring a sauce is difficult to me, but it's trivial for another, so sometimes they'll take control of our arms to stir the pot while cooking. To me it feels like my arms have disappeared and someone else's arms are now attached and stirring the pot. This may be temporal binding window related because we do seem to experience sensory information at different speeds and this might cause us to get that alien hand feeling, which is sort of opposite of the rubber hand illusion.So, I suspect that each of us would react differently to the rubber hand illusion test.",

Sometimes they aren't at archive.org.I hate Google, but I think it's a bit absurd to criticize them on this if somehow it's over AI. The only reason Google created Books may even have been AI, but they were hoping to have the books open to everyone, and the publishers and authors whose full text is being blocked are literally the people who stopped it from happening. Maybe they spoke up about AI, too.

At some point it had to undo everything as it introduced a number of bugs. I asked it: \"What should I add to your prompt so you won't do this again?\" and it gave me this:  ### CRITICAL LESSON: Don't \"Improve\" During Porting\n  -  **BIGGEST MISTAKE: Reorganizing working code**\n    - **What I did wrong:** Tried to \"simplify\" by splitting `createStartButton()` into separate creation and layout methods\n    - **Why it failed:** Introduced THREE bugs:\n      1. Layout overlap (getY() vs getY() - getHeight())\n      2. Children not sized (Group.setSize() doesn't affect children)\n      3. Origins not updated (scaling animations broken)\n    - **The fix:** Deleted my \"improvements\" and copied the original Android pattern faithfully\n    - **Root cause:** Arrogance - assuming I could improve production-tested code without understanding all the constraints\n    - **Solution:** **FOLLOW THE PORTING PRINCIPLES ABOVE** - copy first, don't reorganize\n    - **Time wasted:** ~1 hour debugging self-inflicted bugs that wouldn't exist if I'd just copied the original\n    - **Key insight:** The original Android code is correct and battle-tested. Your \"improvements\" are bugs waiting to happen.\n\n\nI like the self-reflection of Claude, unfortunately even adding this to CLAUDE.md didn't fix it and it kept taking wrong turns so I had to abandon the effort.",

I haven't done much with Rust but whenever I try porting something to Rust with LLMs, it imports like 20 cargo crates first (even when there were no dependencies in the original language).Also Rust for gamedev was a painful experience for me, because rust hates globals (and has nanny totalitarianism so there's no way to tell it \"actually I am an adult, let me do the thing\"), so you have to do weird workarounds for it. GPT started telling me some insane things like, oh it's simple you just need this rube goldberg of macro crates. I thought it was tripping balls until I joined a Rust discord and got the same advice. I just switched back to TS and redid the whole thing on the last day of the jam.",

In this case I had the minified+bundled JS, no documentation, but I did know how I use the system and generally the important behavioral aspects of the web client. There are aspects of the system that I know from experience tend to be tricky, like compositing an embedded browser into other UI, or dealing with VOIP in general. Other aspects, like JS itself, I don't really know deeply. I knew I wanted a Mac .app out the end, as well as Flatpak for Linux. I knew I wanted an mdbook of the protocol and behavioral specs. Do the best you can. Think really hard about how to segment the work for hands-off testability so the assistant can grind the loop of add logs, test run, fix, etc.2. In Claude Desktop (or whatever) paste in the text from 1 and instruct it to research and ask you batches of 10 clarifying questions until it has enough information to write a work plan for how to do the job, specific tools, necessary documentation, etc. Then read and critique until you feel like the thread has the elements of a good plan, and have Claude generate a .md of the plan.3. Create a repo containing the JS file and the plan.4. Add other tools like my preferred template for change implementation plans, Rust style guide, etc (have the chatbot write a language style guide for any language you use that covers the gap between common practice ~3 years ago and the specific version of the language you want to use, common errors, etc). I have specific instructions for tracking current work, work log, and key points to remember in files, everyone seems to do this differently.5. Add Claude Code (or whatever) to the container or machine holding the repo.Repeat until done:6a. Instruct the assistant to do a time-boxed 60 minutes of work towards the goal, or until blocked on questions, then leave changes for your review along with any questions.6b. Instruct the assistant to review changes from HEAD for correctness, completeness, and opportunities to simplify, leaving questions in chat.6c. Review and give feedback / make changes as necessary. Repeat 6b until satisfied.6d. Go back to 6a.At various points you'll find that the job is mis-specified in some important way, or the assistant can't figure out what to do (e.g. if you have choppy audio due to a buffer bug, or a slow memory leak, it won't necessarily know about it). Sometimes you need to add guidance to the instructions like \"update instructions to emphasize that we must never allocate in situation XYZ\". Sometimes the repo will start to go off the rails messy, improved with instructions like \"consider how to best organize this repository for ease of onboarding the next engineer, describe in chat your recommendations\" and then have it do what it recommended.There's a fair amount of hand-holding but a lot of it is just making sure what it's doing doesn't look crazy and pressing OK.",

Each had its own idiosyncrasies, like how everything is a file on Linux, and you're supposed to write programs by chaining existing executables together, or on the desktop, both Win32 and X11 started out with their own versions of UI elements, so XWindow or Win32 would know about where a 'button' was, and the OS was responsible for event handling and drawing stuff.Eventually both Windows and Linux programs moved to a model where the OS just gave you the window as a drawing surface, and you were supposed to fill it.Similarly, all other OS supplied abstractions slowly fell out of use beyond the bare minimum.Considering this, I wonder if it's time to design a new, much lower level abstraction, for file systems in this case, this would be a way to mmap an entire directory into the process space, where each file would be a struct, whicha had a list of pointers for the pages on the disk, and each directory would be a list of such entries, again stored in some data structure you could access, synchronizing reads/writes would be orechestrated by the kernel somehow (I'm thinking locking/unlocking pages being written to).So that way there'd be no difference between traversing an in-memory data structure and reading the disk.I know this approach isnt super compatible with the async/await style of I/O, however I'm not 100% convinced that's the correct approach either (disk paging is a fundamental feature of all OSes, yet is absolutely inexpressible in programming terms)",

You see, CPUs usually have direct access to only one PCI/e in most consumer hardware. The other PCI/e and mvme.2 slots share the same bandwidth and take turns. When someone wants access, they do a dance with the CPU and other parts of the computer using INT or (or interrupt) instructions that make the CPU pause so I/O can take over for a bit. The switching back and forth is costly too and adds up quickly.That said, it wouldn’t explain why a MacBook (which should have the SSD already on the fastest/dedicated pathway) be this slow unless something else in the OS was the bottleneck?I think we’re just scratching the surface here and there is more to this story that is waiting to be discovered.

This turns out to be slow due to stat calls and reading from disk. We replaced our usage of go list with a custom package import graph parser using the std lib parser packages and instead of reading from disk we give the parser byte blobs from git, also using git ls-files to “stat” the files.

(I've also learned recently that the Linux VFS abstractions are quite different from BSD/UNIX, and they don't really map to eachother. Linux has many structures, like dentries and generic inodes, that map to roughly one structure in BSD/UNIX, the vnode structure.

Second, you can easily take off the directory from the zip file, allowing new files to be added without modifying the rest of the file, which can be extended to allow for arbitrary modification of the contents, although you may need to \"defragment\" the file.And I believe, encryption is also per-file.
