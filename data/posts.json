      "abstract": "该讨论围绕特斯拉停产Model S和X车型的消息展开。核心争议在于特斯拉是否在浪费其先发优势及品牌价值。有人认为特斯拉市值虚高，已从电动车代名词沦为依靠炒作维持的“投机服务”公司，并指出马斯克个人言行及车型更新缓慢影响了需求。也有用户指出Model S/X作为高端车型销量占比极小，停产符合商业逻辑，且特斯拉在电池、电机等技术领域仍具优势，应考虑转型为零部件供应商。讨论中提到，部分用户怀念Model S的旗舰地位，对其未进行彻底改款表示失望；同时，其他车企的自动驾驶技术被多次提及，认为已超越特斯拉。普遍共识是Model 3/Y已成为特斯拉的绝对销售主力，但关于公司战略方向及品牌前景存在明显分歧。",

          "content": "Tesla will become a case study on how to completely waste the first-mover advantage.For many people, the very term EV itself is still ubiquitous to Tesla.And somehow Tesla is still worth more than every other non-Chinese automaker combined. $1.5T.GM? $80B. Stellantis? $40B. Toyota? $280B. Mercedes-Benz? $60B. BMW? $55B. Volkswagen Group? Also $55B.I’m sure I’ve missed plenty of others, but I could miss some 18 $50B automakers, and Tesla would still be worth more than all of them combined.If Tesla was valued fairly, it would probably be at the tune of $5B. But I’ll never bet against it, because the markets can remain irrational for longer than I can remain solvent. And for some unbeknownst to me reason, the markets value Tesla as a hot tech company, not a 3rd rate automaker, which is what it actually is.And to add insult to injury, even GM Super Cruise is widely renowned as better and safer than Tesla’s current “FSD”.",

          "content_cn": "特斯拉将成为如何彻底浪费先发优势的典型案例。对许多人而言，电动汽车这个词本身仍与特斯拉紧密相连。然而不知何故，特斯拉的市值仍超过所有其他非中国汽车制造商的总和，高达1.5万亿美元。通用汽车？800亿美元。斯特兰蒂斯？400亿美元。丰田？2800亿美元。梅赛德斯-奔驰？600亿美元。宝马？550亿美元。大众集团？同样550亿美元。我肯定还遗漏了许多其他公司，但即使忽略约18家市值500亿美元的汽车制造商，特斯拉的市值仍高于它们全部的总和。\n\n如果特斯拉被合理估值，其市值可能仅在50亿美元左右。但我永远不会做空它，因为市场非理性的时间可能远超过我维持偿付能力的时间。出于某些我无法理解的原因，市场将特斯拉视为热门科技公司，而非实际上的三流汽车制造商。更雪上加霜的是，甚至连通用的超级巡航系统都被广泛认为比特斯拉当前的“全自动驾驶”更优秀、更安全。"

Front under body changes: https://service.tesla.com/docs/BodyRepair/Body_Repair_Proced...And then the airbag controller gets newer and newer.Not something to market about, but you see steady incremental improvements.What I want to say, the serviceability is very good for the cars.

GM admits the Volt was a stepping stone and not the final product. Tesla's part of the documentary involves a lot of trials and tribulations and even Tesla seeming unsure about their manufacturing problems. (Though the documentary itself spins a hopeful tune.)Of the figures in the documentary the most prescient seems to be Carlos Ghosn, then in charge of Renault-Nissan. He very much insisted that EVs weren't just the future, they were the scramble for the present. Renault took that message to heart and seemed to be the side that won it in the messy divorce that also eventually wound up with Ghosn getting charged for treason and embezzlement in Japan. Which is an incredible and weird story on multiple levels and maybe the documentary makers will get a chance to include that in a third movie for the series.",

Automakers operate on low margins and high volume, and must compete on price, reliability or luxury brand status. Most automakers have multiple brands to sell to all market segments.Tesla's value proposition was that it was going to be an iPod in a world of identikit MP3 players, and charge a premium for it. One brand to rule them all, no pesky dealerships, with futuristic EV tech and a touchscreen dash that made gas-powered, tactile button-laden cars obsolete.That was twenty years ago. Tesla went from leading the pack to struggling to achieve scale, with its limelight-seeking leader increasingly holding it back. The leader wants headlines for pioneering \"cool shit\" and pushing hype to pump the stock price. Buyers on the other hand want affordable and timely repairs (impossible with their resistance to third party body shops and unit cost of replacement parts). As a mature company, it is completely un-equipped to compete with the incumbents whose leaders, not by coincidence, are all largely unknown to the public.",

Making an actual run for Congress is a huge time commitment and I don't see how it would be compatible with being an L7 manager at Amazon. It's not something you do in your free time.His campaign platform also appears to be about AI taking jobs, so I'm more than a little suspicious that getting laid off was part of the plan rather than an actual surprise.The claim that he \"built systems\" should also be taken in the context of his job title, which was in product management. I've held the Product Manager title for a few years, but I wouldn't claim \"I built\" during those times, because I was not the one doing the building. This strikes me as a little misleading.Also that post is full of classic LLM-ism from beginning to end. Note the overuse of the \"It's not this, it's that\" format and other LLM tells.

Average employee retention at companies like Amazon (both voluntary and forced) is ridiculously low - something like 1.5 years. PIPs, forced burnout, mass layoffs etc. are all part of the corporate strategy. The revolving door helps keep costs low because employees leave before the bulk of their stock grants have vested.",

But real LLM-driven layoffs do happen, and from what I have anecdotally seen, they follow a pattern: leadership assumes the new LLM service will make human workers redundant. They then make cuts before the evidence is in. What this means is that today, there are many LLM service deployments that replaced humans while their actual impact remains a mystery. Though it won't be a mystery to leadership forever.One example client that shouldn't dox me: Odom Corporation, a beverage distributor. They purchased an LLM-driven purchasing solution and immediately laid off their entire purchasing team, save for a few members who exist on the periphery. A follow-up with them showed that the system was ordering summer beverages coming into the winter (among many other bad purchasing decisions) and causing a dramatic increase in unsold inventory. Since they believe that LLMs will exponentially improve, they're dismissing it as a one-off because this year's models \"will be so much better\".

It's a spectacle that needs to be seen to be believed.And that just the reporting, planning is another exercise in multiple report writing that I'll save for another day. But, hopefully you get the idea.Amazon is 90% internal document writing and 70% work (9-5 does not really exist, it could, it just doesnt).It's essentially a massive jobs program for middle management that aren't capable enough to join the TSA and that's being unfair to the TSA.The only reason I can think for the existence of the reporting is to give managers something to do between pipping staff.",

The price/craft distinction matters - companies competing on price (Amazon retail) have different incentives than those competing on quality and craft (Notion, Linear). If you're in the price business, replacing expensive US labor with cheaper global labor is rational. If you're in the craft business, it usually isn't.But that framing is incomplete. Amazon isn't just retail - AWS, logistics tech, and AI enablement are craft-heavy. Cutting experienced people in those areas might be short-term thinking dressed up as strategy, not actual optimization.\nThe policy question is where I get stuck. Regulate this, and US companies risk losing ground to foreign competitors who don't follow those rules. Do we want Alibaba as the default American retailer?

This isn’t an unintended consequence.

Historically, governments have often served the interests of their corporate patrons. The system itself is built for maximal extraction, and there is no “invisible hand” waiting in the wings to protect consumers.

I have seen several design templates that use various forms of visuals to assist the user through the “add to Home Screen” process, which is just three steps; Share—-> More —-> Add to Home Screen. It Is arguably even a faster process than going through the App Store, even if users may be more familiar with it.You could accompany it with some copy explaining how it keeps the service efficient and affordable, i.e., possible stating if you were to offer an app you would have to increase the price by 75% to pay Apple their fee and for the extra costs.I suspect other arguments for PWAs would not really matter, like that you have no need to track them or use other abilities an app affords, etc. Most people only care about very few things engineers actually care, let alone know about.I’ve always been an advocate of PWAs whenever it makes sense and will even design and architect to that objective. But even when I would deal with clients, I think the real “up hill battle” is that apps allow for higher fees and charges because they’re more work and come with greater expenses for for-profit apps, so there has been very little incentive to spread general user awareness about the “add to Home Screen”/PWA.It’s a bit of a paradox, but I guess that seems to be an under-appreciated driver in something like “advanced consumer capitalist economies”, where the “rational actor” simply does not exist anymore.",

And neither those who tried it INSTEAD of an SSRI, nor those that took both (SSRI + D) could report any measurable difference.I have a theory on why is that: It is known that low levels of Vitamin D is one likely cause for depression - in Northern Europe, where during winter time people do not get enough sunlight, that correlates very clearly with the suffering of depression.But potentially it simply does not work the other way round: I moved to near the equator, and I therefore basically have sunlight shining out of my butt, but still am depressed.

But beware, the ALA omega 3 fat in flax and plant sources is not the DHA and EPA omega 3 fats used by animal cells, and so it's not as potent as what's in fish.The main problem with ALA is that to have the good effects attributed to omega-3s, it must be converted by a limited supply of enzymes into EPA and DHA. As a result, only a small fraction of it has omega-3's effects — 10%–15%, maybe less. The remaining 85%–90% gets burned up as energy or metabolized in other ways. So in terms of omega-3 \"power,\" a tablespoon of flaxseed oil is worth about 700 milligrams (mg) of EPA and DHA. That's still more than the 300 mg of EPA and DHA in many 1-gram fish oil capsules, but far less than what the 7 grams listed on the label might imply.https://www.health.harvard.edu/heart-health/why-not-flaxseed...Also, beware of omega 6 fats. Seed oils (corn, soy, canola) used in commercial food products are incredibly omega 6 dominant in terms of polyunsaturated fat content. Consequently, the ratio of omega 3 to omega 6 fats we consume has plummeted as food production has industrialized. Omega 3 fats are precursors to generally anti-inflammatory signaling compounds, whereas omega 6 fats are precursors to pro-inflammatory signaling compounds. The bias in fat intake leads to more pro-inflammatory signaling in the body, and a lot of alt health types have alleged this is a major causative factor in the obesity epidemic.This is important for depression, because chronic brain inflammation as a cause of depression was one of the going hypotheses at least a decade ago when I last looked into all of this. Upping omega 3 intake is an intervention that can address chronic inflammation, which is potentially why it improves some cases of depression.Pretty much nobody in the west needs more omega 6s these days. I hear even farmed salmon eat primarily corn and soy based feeds these days, meaning their fat ratio is skewed much more heavily toward omega 6 than wild salmon and fish.",

I'll edit the intro to say you can stack, not substitute, regular antidepressants.> many studies in the Vitamin D meta-analysis enrolled patients already taking antidepressants.Yes, and that's even more encouraging, that there's still effects of Vitamin D on major depression even if already on antidepressants! This suggests we can \"stack\" the interventions.Table 1 of the meta-analysis ( https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11650176/ ) shows the raw sub-group analysis.

As a consequence, SSRI use over a lifetime is also more common than most would assume. Any drug will come with negative side effects for some portion of its users. Multiply that by the high number of people who have ever taken an SSRI and it starts to become obvious why there are so many Internet anecdotes about SSRIs not working.Meanwhile, most people who take SSRIs successfully aren’t going around and advertising the fact that they’re on psychiatric medications. There is less stigma now than there was in the past, but it’s still not something most people like to broadcast to the world. For patients on long term SSRIs in stable states, the SSRI is just a routine thing they take in the background and don’t really think about. There’s no reason for it to come up in conversation.",

No amount of positive thinking can fix physiological issues that you have because of some underlying condition. But it's quite possible to create new issues as a side effect of being depressed, stressed, chronically exhausted, etc. So, working on those issues is probably smart.And each of those things can be caused by physiological issues as well. You might feel stressed because you don't sleep well. You might sleep poorly because you suffer from e.g. sleep Apnea. Which in turn might be because of a mix of physiological and other reasons (diet, weight, alcohol abuse, etc.).Or you might be working too hard, which makes you stressed and causes you to lose a lot of sleep. Different causes that have similar results. Including long term physiological results. Your brain can actually get damaged if you chronically abuse it or neglect it. Many \"between the ears\" type problems are actually physiological.Root causing your issues enables you to deal with them properly instead of fighting the symptoms.Anyway, I take vitamin D and a few other things. Getting yourself checked out regularly once you hit middle age is a good idea. There's a lot of stuff that is long term lethal that a checkup can detect early. And some of it is fixable. I have the usual cardio vascular challenges that many people struggle with because of a combination of genetics, age, and life style. And indeed a vitamin D deficit.I was also recommended to consume more omega-3 as well. Eat salmon. Work some flax/chia seeds in your breakfast. I put flax seeds in my yogurt and use it as a thickener in sauces as well. You have to grind it to dust for it to get absorbed properly. Dirt cheap and it doesn't mess with flavor/texture too much. I keep a jar of ground flax seeds in my fridge. Takes 2 minutes to top it up every 1-2 weeks or so with some freshly ground seeds.But I'm also aware that me being a stressed startup founder has health consequences that a few pills and suplements won't fix for me. I need to actively make sure I get my rest and sleep. I deal a lot better with stressful situations when I'm well rested. And I seem to be better at avoiding getting in to those as well. And I feel happier. Sometimes the best thing I can do for my company is having a proper weekend or going to bed early enough that I can get my 8 hours of sleep. You can survive on 4 hours (been there done that), for a while. But most people are not at their peak performance if they do that.

Dr prescribed megadose of D2, followed by daily D3, but I skipped on the megadose and went straight to D3 -- makes me wonder if a megadose would build up my stores since D is fat-soluble and make it so I could miss a day and not notice.All of the above is anecdotal from me, a self-professed cave dweller, but it's been a couple of years now, and I still notice the difference.

This test / protocol is hard for any driver (including human driven vehicles), let alone ADAS/L3/L4 vehicles, for various reasons, including: pedestrian occlusion, late ped detection, late braking, slick roads, not enough braking, etc. etc.Having said all that, full collision avoidance would have been best outcome, which, in this case, it wasn't.  Wherever the legal fault may lie -- and there will be big debate here -- Waymo will still have to accept some responsibility, given how aggressively they are rolling out their commercial services.This only puts more onus on their team to demonstrate a far higher standard of driving than human drivers.

If that driver would also have been driving a large SUV that child would have been pushed on the ground and ran over, so probably a fatality. And also functionally nobody would have given a shit apart from some lame finger pointing at (probably) the kid’s parents.And it is not the child’s or their parents’ fault either:Once you accept elementary school aged children exist, you have to accept they will sometimes run out like this. Children just don’t have the same impulse control as adults. And honestly even for adults stepping out a bit from behind an obstacle in the path of a car is an easy mistake to make. Don’t forget that for children an SUV is well above head height so it isn’t even possible for them to totally avoid stepping out a bit before looking. (And I don’t think stepping out vs. running out changes the outcome a lot)This is why low speed limits around schools exist.So I would say the Waymo did pretty well here, it travelled at a speed where it was still able to avoid not only a fatality but also major injury.",

US human drivers cause ~7,000 child pedestrian injurys per year [2]. That amounts to a average of 1 child pedestrian injury per ~470 million miles. Waymo has done ~100-200 million fully autonomous miles [3][4]. That means they average 1 child pedestrian injury per ~100-200 million miles. That is a injury rate ~2-4x higher than the human average.However, the child pedestrian injury rate is only a official estimate (possible undercounting relative to highly scrutinized Waymo miles) and is a whole US average (operational domain might not be comparable, though this could easily swing either way), but absent more precise and better information, we should default to the calculated 2-4x higher injury rate; it is up to Waymo to robustly demonstrate otherwise.Furthermore, Waymo has published reasonably robust claims arguing they achieve ~90% crash reduction [5] in total. The most likely new hypotheses in light of this crash are:A. Their systems are not actually robustly 10x better than human drivers. Waymos claims are incorrect or non-comparable.B. There are child-specific risk factors that humans account for that Waymo does not that cause a 20-40x differential risk around children relative to normal Waymo driving.C. This is a fluke child pedestrian injury. Time will tell. Given their relatively robustly claimed 90% crash reduction, it is likely prudent to allow further operation in general, though possibly not in certain contexts.[1] https://afdc.energy.gov/data/10315[2] https://crashstats.nhtsa.dot.gov/Api/Public/Publication/8137...[3] https://www.therobotreport.com/waymo-reaches-100m-fully-auto...[4] https://waymo.com/blog/2025/12/demonstrably-safe-ai-for-auto...[5] https://waymo.com/safety/impact/",

This forces drivers to drive very slow, even when alone on the road, as they can't see if a car or person may be behind the next object.In an other road they added several tight S curves in a row, where if you drive anything faster than 20km/h you will fail the turns and drive onto the artificial constructed curbs.In other roads they put a sign in the middle of two way roads while at the same time drastically limiting the width to the curb, forcing drivers to slow down in order to center the car in the lane and squeeze through.In each of those is that a human driver with human fear of crashing will cause drivers to pay extra attention and slow down.",

(yes, those are my qualifiers...)Here's their main stash [1] but notably, three papers talk about comparison of Waymo's rider-only (i.e. no safety driver) performance vis-a-vis human driver, at 7.1 million miles [2], 25 million miles [3], 56 million miles [4]. Waymo has also been a big contributor to various AV safety standards as one would expect (FWIW, I was also a contributor to 3 of the standards... the process is sausage-making at its finest, tbh).I haven't read thru all their papers, but some notable ones talk about the difficulty of comparing AV vs human drivers [5], and various research on characterising uncertainty / risk of collision, comparing AVs to non-impaired, eyes-on human driver [6]As one may expect, at least one of the challenges is that human-driven collisions are almost always very _lagging indicators_ of safety (i.e. collision happened: lost property, lost limbs, lost lives, etc.)So, net-net, Waymo still has a VERY LONG WAY to go (obviously) to demonstrate better than human driving behavior, but they are showing that their AVs are better-than-humans on certain high-risk (potential) collisions.As somebody remarked, the last 1% takes 90% of time/effort.

So, net-net, I dunno...

Parents may enable this, but ultimately if one’s child does something stupid contrary to one’s guidance and restrictions, they may end up with a Darwin for it.

Society for quite some years has been pushing that down, to the point that a near-death involving a neglectful parent and a witless child is apparently (?) newsworthy — but the number of deaths will never reach zero, whether humans or robots or empty plains and blue skies. There will always be a Veruca Salt throwing themselves into the furnace no matter how many safety processes we impose onto roads, cars, drivers, and/or robots.If you want to see an end to this nonsensical behavior by parents, pressure your local city into having strict traffic enforcement and ticketing during school hours at every local school, so that the parent networks can’t share news with each other of which school is being ‘harassed’ today. Give license points to vehicles that drop a child across the street, issue parking tickets to double parkers, and boot vehicles whose drivers refuse to move when asked. Demand they do this for the children, to protect them from the robots, if you like.But.It’ll protect them much more from the humans than from the robots, and after a few thousand rockets are issued to parents behaving badly, you’ll find that the true threat to children’s safety on school roads is children’s parents — just as the schools have known for decades.

The companies here are also small, creative, solving problems, but don't necessarily aim for an exit and growth at all costs, many of them want to create a sustainable business solving a need that people have.I think, to the economist, these are just SMEs and a start-up is about making money, an IPO, an exit, the unicorns. And of course London as one of the largest financial hubs will be a good place to start such a business.But I've always thought of these \"SME\"-type start-ups as belonging to the start-up category too; after all they \"start up\" a company and often have ambitious goals and creative, tech driven approaches to solving problems. This is how I've thought it would work when I was younger, and it is how I still think it'd be good to do today, and how I'd try to build a company if I have a good idea to pursue.Anyways, the point I want to make re the article is that I think the definition is narrow, leaves out a bunch of interesting companies, and thus skews the picture towards London. There are plenty of innovative places around Europe, it's just a different model of doing start-ups. IMO this overly financially motivated view onto the start-up world is quite a bit less interesting than a the broader (maybe harder to quantify) picture.",

This caused a lot of practical problems, as it stuck everyone in a massive limbo - other EU countries wouldn't accept that you were a portugese resident with the piece of paper they gave you.

The baseline of Sonnet 4.5 (the obvious choice for when they have GPU busy for the next training) should be established to see Opus at some point goes Sonnet level. This was not done but likely we would see a much sharp decline in certain days / periods. The graph would look like dominated by a \"square wave\" shape.3. There are much better explanations for this oscillation: A) They have multiple checkpoints and are A/B testing, CC asks you feedbacks about the session. B) Claude Code itself gets updated, as the exact tools version the agent can use change. In part it is the natural variability due to the token sampling that makes runs not equivalent (sometimes it makes suboptimal decisions compared to T=0) other than not deterministic, but this is the price to pay to have some variability.",

Statistically significant differences in any of those time horizons are reported.They're going to need to provide a lot more detail on their methodology, because that doesn't make a lot of sense. From their graphs, they seem to be calculating the confidence interval around the previous value, then determining whether the new value falls outside of it. But that's not valid for establishing the statistical significance of a difference. You need to calculate the confidence interval of the difference itself, and then see if all the values within that confidence interval remain positive (if it excludes 0).  This is because both the old and new measurement have uncertainty. Their approach seems to be only considering uncertainty for one of them.They should also really be more specific about the time periods. E.g. their graphs only show performance over the past 30 days, but presumably the monthly change is comparing the data from 60 to 31 days ago, to the data from 30 days ago until yesterday? In which case the weekly graph really ought to be displaying the past two months, not one month.",

          "content": "Now I can't stop thinking about _The Experience Machine_ by Andy Clark. It theorizes that this is how humans navigate and experience the real world: Our brains generate what we think the world around is like and our senses don't so much directly process visual information but instead act like a kind of loss function for our internal simulations. Then we use that error to update our internal model of the world.In this view, we are essentially living inside a high-fidelity generative model. Our brains are constantly 'hallucinating' a predicted reality based on past experience and current goals. The data from our senses isn't the source of the image; it's the error signal used to calibrate that internal model. Much like Genie 3 uses latent actions and frames to predict the next state of a world, our brains use 'Active Inference' to minimize the gap between what we expect and what we experience.It suggests that our sense of 'reality' isn't a direct recording of the world, but a highly optimized, interactive simulation that is continuously 'regularized' by the photons hitting our retinas.",

It does require some pretty specific stuff in the system prompt to, for example, avoid confabulating stuff that doesn't fit the world or the scenario.But to really build a version of xg on Claude it needs better ways to remember and improve what it has learned about playing the game, and what it has learned about a specific group of players in a specific scenario as it develops over time.",

I expect the public release uses a cheaper step-distilled / quantized version. The limitations seen in Genie 3 (high control latency, gradual loss of detail and drift towards videogamey behavior, 60s max rollout length) are still present. The editing/sharing tools, latency, cost, etc. can probably improve over time with this same model checkpoint, but new features like audio input/output, higher resolution, precise controls, etc. likely won't happen until the next major version.From a product perspective, I still don't have a good sense of what the market for WMs will look like. There's a tension between serious commercial applications (robotics, VFX, gamedev, etc. where you want way, way higher fidelity and very precise controllability), vs current short-form-demos-for-consumer-entertainment application (where you want the inference to be cheap-enough-to-be-ad-supported and simple/intuitive to use). Framing Genie as a \"prototype\" inside their most expensive AI plan makes a lot of sense while GDM figures out how to target the product commercially.On a personal level, since I'm also working on world models (albeit very small local ones https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43798757), my main thought is \"oh boy, lots of work to do\".

Population Mobility: Generally speaking, in economically developed areas, population figures are often underestimated because a large number of people freely migrate into these regions, and local governments are actually unclear about the exact increase in population. In contrast, in less economically developed areas, population figures are often overestimated because many people leave to work in cities, only returning to their hometowns for brief periods each year.2. Mortality Data: China’s birth data is already quite accurate. Nowadays, the vast majority of babies are born in hospitals, unlike decades ago when midwives would come to homes to assist with deliveries. Moreover, birth certificates must be issued immediately after a baby is born. However, China’s mortality data is not precise, primarily because burials are still common in many rural areas, and these death records are often delayed.For example, my city conducted multiple rounds of mass COVID-19 testing in 2021.  Each time, more than 4.4 million people were tested, but our small city's 2020 census results only showed a population of 3.7 million.",

And chat trained AIs were already quite \"meh\" at creative writing to begin with.  4.1 was the last of its breed.So we'll have to wait until \"creativity\" is solved.Side note: I've been wondering lately about a way to bring creativity back to these thinking models.  For creative writing tasks you could add the original, pretrained model as a tool call.  So the thinking model could ask for its completions and/or query it and get back N variations.  The pretrained model's completions will be much more creative and wild, though often incoherent (think back to the GPT-3 days).  The thinking model can then review these and use them to synthesize a coherent, useful result.  Essentially giving us the best of both worlds.  All the benefits of a thinking model, while still giving it access to \"contained\" creativity.",

          "content": "Okay this is the type of post I want to see and the answer is absolutely an yes.For context, I think I have recently been part of the lowendbox community and discussing things with providers etc.Recently one of their providers actually cited the price increase directly to ram increase.I was in talks with other VPS providers one of whom literally shared me a photo in the forum of what it costs them to get ram in their area.I have been in talks with many many people within the VPS community and I have said this so many ocuntless times in here or lowendtalk (you can read my comments although I used to say this ~1 month ago iirc)Heck, I wanted to build my own cloud. My father works in the bandwidth business (essentially you can say broadband/wifi)for ~10-15 years/ has very strong ties in it.I on the other hand like/love tinkering with software side of things including virtualization and have made projects about it. I shared some request one month ago to talk to my dad and he said he was interested in datacenter ideaBut I shit you not, it literally doesn't make sense even though A) my father has its own office, b) he can get essentially lots of bandwidth for free, C) we live in country with very cheap electricity comparative to many others.And even if you have lots of hardwares, it doesn't just make sense to still have it if the price of replacement has increased so much far far.There is also a forum called lowendspirit and I saw someone shut down their service citing this as well.There are many posts on lowendbox (in which I have talked to) talking about the same thing as wellSimply I don't know how to state it, but the 4x price increase within ram simply literally didn't make sense. No thanks. I (or we?) are gonna wait the AI bubble or do something else/work more on software sides/just relax instead of making this.I haven't even read the post but this is the most connected post I have felt in a long time!To be really honest, I will admit that right now, personally I am either looking at mac 512 gb ultra or something which are still not ramflated from what I can tell or something or to be really honest, most cloud providers are burning money to not create a frenzy or still have pricing the same.Personally, I love small cloud providers but recent times indiciate to me to favour stability. I have a netcup server myself but hetzner is an absolute love too from what i can tell and I can recommend any & OVH is another brilliant solution. All European.Because these have/probably have large supplies. Soo like I know that OVH literally creates their own machiens, buys land and does everything and is a stock company so they are kind of a capital expenditure -> getting maximal profits machine in some sense (like yknow eliminating as much as middleman as possible kind of thing?) soo I guess the chances of OVH has lots of money to burn through to survive & brand reputation is crucial too and usually many of these run Black friday sometimes tooI guess another part is that most cloud providers can offset the losses right now for the hardware which can get cheap when the AI hardware bubble bursts but I odn't really know. I guess OVH or others might internally discuss this possibility too.Atleast for me, I am gonna build software regarding the projects. I have found a huge disprecancy where whmcs and others have an almost monopoly so I am probably gonna spend a few months creating an open source project alternative (technically I already have a preview working with gvisor which I used with my netcup vps itself because gvisor can work in kvm machines itself not requiring nested kvm)To be honest, shit's really hit the fan in this industry in ways that I can't tell. I have/had been in talks with an UK provider (https://xhosts.uk) [promoting because seems like a good guy] & he said that he's suffering the losses/taking the hits (for additional context he is disabled but iirc doesn't take disability checks) & he is from what I can tell actually impacted by such rising costs.So being honest, this mad fuckery of an AI bubble is hurting an disabled person who wants to make a genuine living doing things he like.I really want this bubble to pop right now. Like please. Just pop it and have the prices of hardware low because I talk to these providers and they are normal people like you and me and their business is impacted too all the while these large companies like AWS,GCP,Azure is what people use to rent or some shit in the first place with the returns/rent seeking that they are while you can get things for cheaper in lowendbox and other places in the first place but yeah of course you won't get the same stability (but will get pretty damn close imo)  for much cheaper but what many people want is the ability to discount that when half of internet shuts down because of AWS east 1 just feeling like it, the customers wouldn't blame them directly for picking AWS but I guess if they use something even reliable lik ehetzner and say hetzner might have one downtime (which is rare but yea lets assume so) then maybe customers or business owners or anyone higher or lower in the team might push on the original person who might've suggested hetzner and they might get (fired?) or these are the justifications I see as to when people suggest that hey aws is bloated and burns so quickly, why not use alternatives like hetzner and many many other awesome services.Thanks for listening to my (rant) & have a nice day (as one might have after the AI bubble given that no matter how harshly I write, no matter what I do, quite frankly I have no say in the AI bubble, so I personally what I like to do is actually use AI for free or the cheap and burn so much money of these AI companies to actually build open source cloud solution or something when the bubble pops but its a bit of an ideal but something I am working on I guess with the gvisor thing.I don't know how to point it out but the tech behind AI is cool. There are gonna be some persisting changes (open weights model like kimi k2.5) etc. but I just don't know.I really don't like the current timeline I live in regarding AI man. And I would consider myself to be sort of a person who actually uses AI many times but I do feel as a net, I feel as if AI might have been negative or atleast AI in the past year for some reason. Claude 3.5 sonnet or Deepseek v3 & things were going okay. Beyond that something definitely changed I mean there was already a bubble during DSv3 days but somehow it was still realist (the stock market). Right now I feel a fundamental disconnect between reality and market and  the longer it continues, the worse its aftermath.I really don't know how to describe what I am feeling but hopefully I have done a good job (with this lengthy comment) to explain all the things that i felt like talkjing aboutThank you to the author for creating this article so that we can have this relevant discussion.

In 2016, you could get a DDR4-2400 16GB kit for $81 [1], and a comparable G.SKILL Ripjaws V kit was around $52 [2]. Today (January 2026), that same G.SKILL kit costs $105-146 [3], and most 16GB DDR4 kits are running $95-150 [4]. So RAM is actually more expensive now than it was 10 years ago, not cheaper.The \"did we have X 10 years ago\" argument also misses a a lot of modern software requirements. Yes, we had mid-range laptops and budget gaming PCs in 2016, but the memory footprint of everyday applications has exploded since then. Electron-based apps (Slack, Teams, VS Code, Discord) routinely consume 500MB-1GB+ each [5], and it's entirely normal to have multiple running simultaneously. A typical \"light\" workload in 2026 easily uses 2-3x the RAM that a comparable workflow needed in 2016.So we're getting squeezed from both sides: applications demand more memory whilst memory itself costs more. An 8GB laptop was perfectly serviceable for office work in 2016; in 2026, it's borderline unusable with a few Chrome tabs and Teams open. The same kit that cost $55 in June 2025 now costs $150 [2, again]. That's a 150%+ increase in six months, pushing capable systems out of reach for budget-conscious users precisely when software bloat is making RAM more essential than ever.[1] https://gamersnexus.net/industry/3212-ram-price-investigatio...  \n[2] https://gamersnexus.net/news/ram-wtf  \n[3] https://www.newegg.com/p/pl?d=ddr4+ram+8gb  \n[4] https://pcpartpicker.com/trends/price/memory/  \n[5] https://josephg.com/blog/electron-is-flash-for-the-desktop/",

The last time they did that, in the crypto boom, the boom quickly turned into a bust and the memory makers got burned with a bad case of oversupply for years. With that context, can you blame them for wanting to go a bit more slowly with this boom?Sure, the new fabs won't be up and at volume production until late 2027 / early 2028, but committing tens of billions of dollars to new production facilities, including to facilities dedicated to DRAM rather than NAND or HBM, is hardly 'abandoning'. They're pivoting to higher profit margin segments - rational behavior for a for-profit corporation - but thanks to the invisible hand of the (not quite as free as it should be) market, this is, partially, a self-solving issue, as DRAM margins soar while HBM margins compress, and we're already seeing industry response to that dynamic, too: https://www.guru3d.com/story/samsung-reallocates-of-hbm3-cap...",

Although after the 3 months, I have to pay more around ~5-6$ per month but its still a recurring deal so I guess I might as well continue it (given I have setten everything up)Some of it is definitely lose making as well to lock in. I usually try to see what gets me to buy a deal because i usually don't buy many things especially online and its usually within some deal concept where I feel like \"winning\" that I do.But to be honest, I did some napkin math and honestly, at least for my VPS (although Its usually idle but I have hosted many services on it or experimented with it, its honestly pretty fun imo, I definitely feel so much more freedom imo somehow after getting a vps its hard to explain I suppose or maybe not idk)But my napkin maths suggests that they lose quite a lot of money with atleast my deal in particular so I got better off getting this deal than say if I was netcup myself somehow (because they probably lose net money on my deal if I actually really use my allocated limits I guess) atleast for the 3 months but I feel like netcup's still one of the more cheaper options and I got a recurring discount deal with it too sooo I would still consider them to have only marginal profits over a long term deal as well.SO I guess overall, this was a really profitable deal for me.Your deal's pretty cool too, honestly at large scale. I have done scraping of lowendtalk and analyzed and done many decisions and infrastructural decisions and honestly I will say taht for anything somewhat large scale like you mention 32 gb or something, I found hetzner boxes to be the best/most referred to option & OVH kimsufi line is created to be the cheapest dedicated boxes.But yeah regarding OVH i recommend this website that I found regarding OVH KS line or just in general https://checkservers.ovhJust checked it right now and I see  Xeon E-2274G 4c / 8t 4.4 GHz+ 32 GB DDR4 ECC 2666 MHz 2 x 960 GB NVMe for around 37-38 euros ishAlso Netcup's definitely not small. I looked at anexia group and I wouldn't constitute them as small. For understanding what small means I guess when I mean small, I mean lowendbox single shop providers and others.Also regarding Netcup, its payment system was really ass from what I felt like. Like It was the first company which made me feel like I wanted to pay it money but I had to make a CCP or some account nad literally had to go through like 3-4 really long things imo which really made me say (wtf) in my head each time and frustrated me only to give me a stripe link in the end.It had me so pissed that for 2-3 days one idea of simplifying its whole process and other such providers stuck in my head. Its payment / the whole process of I want to pay -> create account -> actually pay had like 5-6 maybe 7 steps or something and I seriously can't tell you how I frustrated I was but the deal was too lucrative lol",

          "content": "I'm glad the charges were dismissed, but to be honest the original reporting shows the story was actually more nuanced than this article led me to believe. 2019 article: https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2019/11/how-a...I'll probably get downvoted for even questioning the narrative, but here are some of the nuances that stood out to me:- When the police contacted someone listed on the authorization letter, that person denied that they had been authorized to conduct physical intrusions. Another contact didn't answer their phone. What are the police supposed to do if the people supposedly authorizing the intrusion are actively denying the authorization?- The contract had vague language that say they couldn't \"force-open doors\". The two men told police they had used a tool to open a locked door. The language should have been more specific about what was and was not allowed. (EDIT: This is causing a lot of controversy. The legal definition of \"forced entry\" in my state does not require literal damage to the property, only a bypassing of barriers. I don't know about the circumstances in this state, but to be clear the term \"force-open doors\" doesn't necessarily mean using destructive force everywhere)- The contract said \"alarm subversion\" was not allowed, but supposedly the police had evidence that they were trying to manipulate the alarm. They deny this.- The men had been drinking alcohol before the break-in. By the time they were breathalyzed it was at 0.05, meaning the number was even higher when they started the break-in. Drinking alcohol before you do a professional job guaranteed to get the police responding is a terrible idea.- After they tripped the alarm and the police showed up, they didn't immediately identify themselves and end the exercise. They hid from the police, claiming that they were \"testing the authorities' response\" which seems obviously out of scope for their agreement.So I agree that the charges were excessive and the Sheriff was in the wrong on a lot of things, but after reading the details this wasn't really a clear cut case. The pentesters weren't really doing everything \"by the book\" if they thought that testing the police response by hiding was in scope of their contract and doing this job after a few alcoholic beverages is a bizarre choice.",

The likelihood is high that the team will interface with law enforcement. The escalation path within the enforcement side of the state regulatory machine should be cleared in advance.I think the takeaway for security teams is that you shouldn't let the customer \"authorize\" what is otherwise criminal activity warranting a police response without getting some air cover from the enforcement side. Coordinating that is the customer's burden to bear and that cover should be secured before letting them hand-wave away the risks with a \"just have the police call me and I'll clear it all up\". In hindsight only, when you look at it like that, the security team was not covering their ass appropriately. In a perfect world, you'd assume there's some better planning and communication going on behind the curtain. In the real world, you need more than the flimsy \"guarantee\" of calling a guy who knows a guy in the middle of the night.

      "content": "Hey HN, we're Haakam, Michael, and Adi. We're building AgentMail (https://agentmail.to), the email inbox API for agents. We’re not talking about AI for your email, this is email for your AI.Email is an optimal interface for long-running agents. It’s multithreaded and asynchronous with full support for rich text and files. It’s a universal protocol with identity and authentication built in. Moreover, a lot of workflow critical context already lives in email.We wanted to build email agents that you can forward your work to and get back a completed task. The agents could act entirely autonomously as you wouldn't need to delegate your identity. If they did get stuck they could just send you, or anyone else, an email.Using Gmail, we kept getting stuck on the limitations of their API. No way to create inboxes programmatically. Rate and sending limits. OAuth for every single inbox. Keyword search that doesn't understand context. Per-seat pricing that doesn't work for agents.So we built what we wished existed: an email provider for developers. APIs for creating inboxes and configuring domains. Email parsing and threading. Text extraction from attachments. Realtime webhooks and websockets. Semantic search across inboxes. Usage-based pricing that works for agents.Developers, startups, and enterprises are already deploying email agents with AgentMail. Agents that convert conversations and documents into structured data. Agents that source quotes, negotiate prices, and get the best deals. Agents that emulate internet users for training models on end-to-end tasks.Here's demo of Clawdbots communicating using AgentMail: https://youtu.be/Y0MfUWS3LKQYou can get started with AgentMail for free at https://agentmail.toLooking forward to hearing your thoughts and feedback.",

      "content_cn": "大家好，我们是Haakam、Michael和Adi。我们正在开发AgentMail（https://agentmail.to），这是一个为智能体设计的邮箱收件箱API。我们讨论的不是为你的邮箱添加AI功能，而是为你的AI系统提供邮箱服务。\n\n邮箱是长时间运行智能体的理想界面。它支持多线程和异步操作，完全兼容富文本和文件传输。作为一种通用协议，它内置了身份验证机制。更重要的是，许多工作流程中的关键信息本就存在于邮箱中。\n\n我们的目标是创建这样的邮箱智能体：你可以将工作转发给它们，并收到已完成的任务。这些智能体可以完全自主运行，无需借用你的身份。如果遇到问题，它们可以直接给你或其他人发送邮件。\n\n在使用Gmail时，我们不断遇到其API的限制：无法通过编程创建收件箱、存在频率和发送限制、每个收件箱都需要OAuth认证、关键词搜索无法理解上下文、按席位计费的模式不适用于智能体。\n\n因此我们决定构建自己的解决方案……",
      "abstract": "该HackerNews帖子讨论了AgentMail项目，这是一个为AI智能体提供专属邮箱收件箱的API服务。核心话题围绕将电子邮件作为智能体间长期运行的通信协议是否合理。\n\n社区观点呈现明显分歧。支持者认为，电子邮件作为成熟、通用的异步协议，能有效解决当前智能体间的互操作性问题，且其内置身份验证和富文本支持非常适合工作流集成。有用户指出，类似Rails的Action Mailbox已证明为数据记录分配邮箱地址能开启许多创新应用场景。\n\n反对声音主要集中于协议的长期适用性。有人认为，依赖电子邮件是“用今日创新解决过时范式”，当智能体主导通信时，应建立专属协议（如Google的A2A协议），而非沿用为人类设计的语义系统。另有用户对垃圾邮件风险、服务条款合规性以及提示注入攻击的防范措施提出担忧。\n\n讨论中普遍认同电子邮件在当前阶段具有桥梁价值，但对于它是否会成为智能体通信的最终标准协议存在不同预期。部分用户期待项目未来能扩展至支付、电话等其他通信形式。",

FlightRadar and others have networks of people with receivers that forward all received packets to central servers.The aircraft self-report location, heading, altitude, etc, so anyone can transmit packets making ghost planes.I am somewhat surprised nobody has stashed an ADS-B spoofer near ATL or AMS that just broadcasts tracks of A380 tail numbers crossing the runways perpendicular at 500 ft AGL or something.  They have primary radar, sure, but I imagine there would still be a temporary disruption until people figured out what was going on.I think this is the first case I’ve seen of ADS-B spoofing in the wild.EDIT: this was spoofed reports to the data aggregators via the internet, not broadcast on radio waves.

The only real downside of JITs is the added latency similar to the lag induced by shader compilation, but this could be addressed by having a smart code cache instead.

IT is safe to say that most games are developed and run on the developers PC and then ported to the target system.  If they know the target system they will make sure it works on the system from day one, but most developers are going to prefer to run their latest changes on their current system over sending it to the target system.  If you really need to take advantage of the hardware you can't do this, but most games don't.Many games are written in a high level language (like C...) which doesn't give you easy access to self modifying code.  (even higher level languages like python do, but they are not compiled and so not part of this discussion).  Likewise, jumping to arbitrary code is limited to function calls for most programmers.Many games just run on a game engine, and the game engine is something we can port or rewrite to other systems and then enable running the game.Be careful of the above: most games don't become popular. It is likely the \"big ticket games\" people are most interested in emulating had the development budget and need to take advantage of the hardware in the hard ways.

It started when we migrated to Docker more than a decade ago - before docker-compose was a thing, building and running a set of containers required quite a bit of shell scripting, and we decided to use Make for that. Make is ubiquitous, cross-platform, the targets are essentially snippets of shell with some additional features/syntax added on top, there's a dependency system (you can naturally express things like \"if you want to run X, you need to build Z and Y first, then X, then you can run it\"), it allows for easy parameterization (`make <target> ARG=val`), plus it's actually Turing-complete language with first-class lambdas and capacity for self-modifying code[1]. And when some rule becomes too complex, it's trivial to dump it into `scripts/something.sh` and have Make call it. Rewriting the script in another language also works, and Make still provides dependencies between targets.TL;DR: Make is a very nice tool for gathering the \"auxiliary\" scripts needed for a project in a language-agnostic manner. It's better than setup.py and package.json precisely because it provides a single interface for projects of both kinds.[1] Which is worth knowing so you can avoid both features like the plague.",

          "content": "About the same time the 500-mile email problem happened (mid 1990s), I had a difficult to understand issue with my office PC. Every morning, I'd come in, slide my hard drive sled in, and turn the computer on. We had 128 Kbps ISDN internet at the office and I had the same at home, but that was too slow to do much work. So I'd take the drive home so I could work at night, especially in the winter when the office was too cold at night.Suddenly one winter morning, the PC wouldn't boot. I had to run to a meeting. When I got back, I turned the PC off and on again and everything was fine. The next morning, the same thing happened. The third day, I didn't have a meeting. I turned it off and back on, still no boot. I'd gotten in late, so I just turned it off and took an early lunch. When I got back, it still wouldn't boot. But I had a meeting, so I ran to that, leaving the computer on. When I got back, it booted fine.The next morning, same thing. I decided to look inside, not having any idea what might cause such symptoms. As I took the shell off, a tiny mouse came out, jump off my desk, and ran across my lap before jumping on the floor and scurrying out of sight. From inside the computer came the smell of mouse urine. Apparently he'd been crawling in through the open drive bay to keep warm every night, and urinating while he was in there. Once the computer had been on for a while, the heat and airflow would dry it out enough to eliminate whatever electrical short was keeping it from booting. I went to the store and bought an empty drive sled to put in the drive bay whenever I took my drive out, and the problem never came back. I felt lucky that the liquid didn't cause permanent damage.",

Fine, it's an old laptop I'm using as a media server, battery is long dead - this never happened before but maybe something is loose. I checked the power supply and restarted it. It failed again at the same point in the video, and again a third time. Something about that video causes my laptop to die.I turned it off and went to bed. Maybe I'll troubleshoot it today. But I'd love to understand what could have happened. The closest thing I know of is the Janet Jackson video that could crash hard drives [0]. In this case the sound was playing on a different device (my TV) so I don't think it's the same explanation.For extra weirdness, the episode was Black Mirror S7E01.

Or jump to just before it dies and see if it plays through.If by \"downloaded\" you mean The High Seas, those who provision the high seas are often on the cutting edge of using codecs with every last feature turned on to make the videos smaller to squeeze every last bit out of the encodings that they can, which can make them unusually expensive to decode.

He said you have to figure out what's different. It sounds obvious or simple, but if you go with that mindset, when someone's stuck in the \"it works on my machine idk why\" sure enough I ask \"what is DIFFERENT from your machine and this one?\" and it almost always leads to the right answers.

Docker images have layers, so the registry could store one layer that is reused across multiple images, as one example.Ollama did this too, but I'm unsure of why. I know the author used to work at Docker, but almost no data from weights can be shared in that way, so instead of just storing \"$model-name.safetensor/.gguf\" on disk, Ollama splits it up into blobs, has it's own index, and so on. For seemingly no gain except making it impossible to share weights between multiple applications.I guess business-wise, it was easier for them to now make people use their \"cloud models\" so they earn money, because it's just another registry the local client connects to. But also means Ollama isn't just about running local models anymore, because that doesn't make them money, so all their focus now is on their cloud instead.At least as a LM Studio, llama.cpp and vLLM user, I can have one directory with weights shared between all of them (granted the format of the weight works in all of them), and if I want to use Ollama, it of course can't use that same directory and will by default store things it's own way.",

At that point you might as well deploy a router that has a supportable software stack and where possible sober IP instead of legacy IP..I have been running IPv6-only networks since 2005 and have been deploying IPv6-only networks since 2009. When I encountered a small implementation gap in my favorite BSD, I wrote and submitted a patch.Anyone who complained about their favorite open source OS having an IPv6 implementation gap or was using proprietary software (and then also dumb enough to complain about it), should be ashamed of themselves for doing so on any forum with \"hacker\" in the name. But we all know they aren't ashamed of themselves because the competency crisis is very real and the coddle culture let's such disease fester.There is no excuse to not deploy at minimum a dual-stack network if not an IPv6-only network. If you deploy an IPv4-only network you are incompetent, you are shitting up the internet for everyone else, and it would be better for all of humanity if you kept any and all enthusiasm you have for computers entirely to yourself (not a single utterance).",

The founders wrote their masters thesis on object detection and pattern recognition using sentinel imaging. They had basically one product: to detect certain objects. After a couple of years they had gotten a handful of customers (basically they'd receive coordinates to some are of interest, and then tasked with trying to detect something), which afforded them to purchase commercial data (from other types of sensors) for building more robust systems. This in turn grew their customer bas, and they started adding products.Then they were acquired by one of the largest private space companies.But, in any case, it all started with access to free data.

The main improvement in forecasting comes due to better information in the initial condition of the numerical weather prediction, but it is hard to quantify in advance. I'd be surprised if MAE, over the 15 days the prediction spans, would improve more than 0.1 C, if we talk about the raw prediction.\nThere are plenty of things that this data is used for, but I would say that improved nowcast of cloud coverage, and energy production related parameters are likely to benefit most from the improvement in resolution.",

These guys [1] are pretty stoked about “nowcasting”—which seems to be on sub-10-minute timescales to issue local severe weather warnings and such. It appears current sounders don’t scan as often.This project ppt from 2011 [2] references different requirements for different areas/teams and shows the instrument spits out readings at 150 Mbit/s, which seems like a good clip. Overall it sounds like a lot of local knowledge is involved in turning this output into forecasts. Maybe there’s not a precise answer to your question.Somebody else must know more.[1]: https://www.eumetsat.int/features/think-global-act-local[2]: https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Donny-Aminou/publicatio...",

In fact, I would say that ChatGPT is better than most doctors because most doctors don't actually listen to you.

The level of reassurance that I was doing everything right actually made me feel less scared, because it was a pretty serious problem. Everything it told me was 100% correct and it guided me perfectly.I was taking one high blood pressure medication but then noticed my blood sugar jumped. I did some research with ChatGPT and it found a paper that did indicate that it could raise blood sugar levels and gave me a recommendation for an alternative  I asked my doctor about it and she said I was wrong, but I gently pushed her to switch and gave the recommended medication. She obliged, which is why I have kept her for almost 30 years now, and lo and behold, my blood sugar did drop.Most people have a hard time pushing back against doctors and doctors mostly work with blinders on and don't listen. ChatGPT gives you the ability to keep asking questions without thinking you are bothering them.I think ChatGPT is a great advance in terms of medical help in my opinion and I recommend it to everyone. Yes, it might make mistakes and I caution everyone to be careful and don't trust it 100%, but I say that about human doctors as well.",

There are a lot of ways to do instrumentation....I'd be very curious HOW exactly the models fail.Are the test sets just incredibly specific about what output they except, and you get a lot of failures because of tiny subtle mismatches? Or do they just get the instrumentation categorically wrong?Also important: do the models have access to a web search tool to read the library docs?\nOtel libraries are often complicated to use... without reading latest docs or source code this would be quite tricky.Some models have gotten better at adding dependencies, installing them and then reading the code from the respective directory where dependencies get stored, but many don't do well with this.All in all, I'm very skeptical that this is very useful as a benchmark as is.I'd be much more interested in tasks like:Here are trace/log outputs , here is the source code, find and fix the bug.",

If it does, that suggests the bottleneck is recall not reasoning.

They could do Site Reliability Vibing or something like that.When we ask it to generate an image, any image will do it. We couldn't care less. Try to sculpt it, try to rotate it 45 degrees and all hell breaks loose. The image would be rotated but the hair color could change as well. Pure vibes!When you ask it to refactor your code, any pattern would do it. You could rearrange the code in infinite ways, rename variables in infinite ways without fundamentally breaking logic. You could make as many arbitrary bullshit abstraction and call it good, as people have done it for years with OOP. It does not matter at all, any result would do it in this cases.When you want to hit an specific gRPC endpoint, you need an specific address and the method expects an specific contract to be honored. This either matches or it doesn't. \nWhen you wish the llms could implement a solution that captures specifics syscalls from specifics hosts and send traces to an specific platform, using an specific protocol, consolidating records on a specific bucket...you have one state that satisfy your needs and 100 requirement that needs to necessarily be fulfilled. It either meet all the requirements or it's no good.It truly is different from Vibing and llms will never be able to do in this. Maybe agents will, depending on the harnesses, on the systems in place, but one model just generate words words words with no care about nothing else",

Competence comes from years of experience fighting fires.The search space for a cause beyong a certain size can also be big. Very big.Like, at work we're at the beginning of where the powerlaw starts going nuts. Somewhere around 700 - 1000 services in production, across several datacenters, with a few dozen infrastructure clusters behind it. For each bug, if you looked into it, there'd probably by 20 - 30 changes, 10 - 20 anomalies, and 5 weird things someone noticed in the 30 minutes around it.People already struggle at triaging relevance of everything in this context. That's something I can see AI start helping and there were some talks about Meta doing just that - ranking changes and anomalies in order of relevance to a bug ticket so people don't run after other things.That's however just the reactive part of OPS and SRE work. The proactive part is much harder and oftentimes not technical. What if most negatively rated support cases run into a dark hole in a certain service, but the responsible team never allocates time to improve monitoring, because sales is on their butt for features? LLMs can identify this maybe, or help them implement the tracing faster, but those 10 minutes could also be spent on features for money.And what AI model told you to collect the metrics about support cases and resolution to even have that question?",

      "abstract": "该讨论围绕iPhone 16成为2025年最畅销智能手机、苹果占据畅销机型榜单七席的现象展开。核心话题涉及苹果产品的市场主导力、用户换机动机以及智能手机行业的竞争格局。\n\n社区观点多元。有用户从自身经验出发，认为畅销源于换机周期集中，例如用户1指出许多用户从旧机型升级至16时感知差异不大；用户3则因存储空间不足而换机，但除接口变化外未觉明显提升。部分用户质疑频繁换机的必要性，用户2感叹厂商仅凭相机微升级就能推动每年换机，用户7表示更换电池后旧款iPhone 12仍足够使用，这对苹果构成挑战。另有用户从市场结构分析，用户4和用户5认为苹果机型数量少、聚焦高端，类似特斯拉在汽车市场的策略，而安卓阵营因品牌众多分散了份额；用户8则对三星旗舰机型未每年上榜表示惊讶。讨论中还提及历史预测的反差，用户6引用埃里克·雷蒙德过去关于苹果份额将低于10%的观点，与现实形成对比。\n\n共识在于苹果凭借少量机型占据高端市场主导地位，且用户换机常受非性能因素（如存储、电池）驱动。分歧主要体现在对换机行为合理性的评价，以及安卓阵营竞争策略的有效性。",

The pressure varies around a body in a moving fluid because it is related to the fluid momentum (mass times velocity). The velocity varies around the body because of the flow deflection described above.\"I.e. pressure differential is experienced as lift and is caused by the flow turning.Explaining the actual cause of the flow turning and resulting lift (and why attachment is maintained along top surface) requires looking at fluid dynamics/navier-stokes including pressure differentials, viscosity etc. The pressure differentials allow a more comprehensive way of breaking down the forces at play.I like this video for a more comprehensive understanding without getting too in the weeds with the math: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aa2kBZAoXg0",

No, most of the lift (depends on the plane but in the ballpark of 80-90%) comes from the overall shape of the wings. ~20% is from leading edge airfoil deflection dynamics.And if, say, airfoil was never discovered, we'd probably design the whole wing slightly differently to compensate for it, so the actual difference wouldn't even be 20%.Airfoil is about as important as winglets, and planes fly without winglets just fine.

          "content": "To be more specific,You can't escape momentum exchange. To generate an upward force, the airplane must exert a downward force on the air molecules.An airfoil does this more efficiently than a flat plate, essentially using the top shape to create a low pressure area that sucks the air over the top downwards, imparting the downwards momentum, along with deflecting the air downward on the bottom surface. A flat plate pitched upwards \"stalls\" the air on the top surface, because the air has to travel forward some to fill the gap by the plate moving forward - so this creates a lot of drag as the plate is imparting more forward momentum on the air.The issue is that to analyze lift using momentum, you have to do statisitcal math on a grid of space around the airfoil, which is super complex.  So instead, we use concept of pressure with static and dynamic pressure differences creating lift, because it makes sense to most people learning this, which then all gets rolled up into a plot of lift coefficient vs angle of attack.And as you dive deeper, you learn more analysis tools. For example, there is also another way to analyze performance of an airfoil more accurately, which is called vorticity. If you subtract the average velocity of the airflow around an airfoil, the vector field becomes a circle. In vector math, the total curl of the vector field is directly correlated to the effective lift an airfoil can produce. This method accounts for any shape of the airfoil.But under the hood its all momentum.",

      "content_cn": "https://github.com/AlexanderGrooff/mermaid-asciihttps://mermaid-ascii.art/",
      "abstract": "该帖子讨论了在终端中渲染Mermaid图表的工具\"Mermaid ASCII\"。核心话题是这一工具如何将Mermaid图表转换为ASCII艺术形式，使其能在终端中直接显示。\n\n社区普遍认为该工具很酷且实用，有用户称赞其创意并计划试用，也有用户指出它甚至能实现Mermaid本身缺乏的泳道图近似功能。讨论中提到多个相关工具，如Diagon和文本转图表工具列表，并建议可搭配Unicode绘图工具使用。\n\n主要争议点集中在技术偏好和可访问性上。一方面，有用户认为Mermaid的样式定制较繁琐，更倾向于使用PlantUML等表达性更强的工具；另一方面，有用户指出ASCII图表虽美观但牺牲了可访问性，可能不符合现代无障碍标准，而Mermaid本身也在改进可访问性。\n\n共识在于ASCII图表在终端和网页中保持视觉一致性的价值，且工具的创新功能受到认可。分歧则体现在对不同图表工具的偏好以及对可访问性问题的不同重视程度。",

By the time we ship, we mostly likely will be shipping 6.18.Now we do intend to upstream, we've even got mainline u-boot to start working with the device albeit the display. We were waiting for the hardware configuration to be stabilized before we submit the device trees and start actively working on mainline support. It won't happen overnight but you will see our documentation clearly defining how far we are from the mainline. Also to add here, compared to other SOCs, NXP already has very good mainline support.",

As far as geekbench goes it hits between the Pi 3 and Pi 4, faster EMMC and LPDDR4 gives it a bigger boost compared to the Pi 3. The PCIe 3.0 is also there. Yes it is not equivalent to a desktop use, but for a phone sized usecases, the processor has not been a bottle neck. The advantage you get is a battery life that goes 7 hours on idle with the display on, and on sleep it can go upto 8D and wake up instantly.The IMX95 is 6x A55 at 1.8GHz but you can check the geekbench below, it matches the single core performance of Pi 4 and beats it at multi-core performance while offering LPDDR5. But at the same time, is only 15% more power hungry than the 8MP.So the way we see it -Pi 3 < Comet 8MP < Pi 4 < Comet 95 < Pi 5Ref: https://browser.geekbench.com/v6/cpu/compare/15259040?baseli...Edit: The IMX95 is 6-cores A55 and not 4-cores",

So if you buy such from outside of Europe, buy from Amazon instead of directly, not KS/IGG.Second, their BIOS is a beta version of a commerciel BIOS, lol. As such, it doesn't have Intel SGX enabled.That said, it served me as cyberdeck before cyberdecks were all the rage, and before they were easy and cheap to build. It stems from a time when ARM64 wasn't still as powerful as the current (approx) decade. Of course the machine has some downsides for 2026 standards. 2x USB-A, 1x USB-C, for example. I'd rather have 2x USB-C, since you use one for power. I also modded the device for better thermals, and have replaced the battery. The machine sits behind 8 philips screws.One cool thing the GPD Pocket 3 and GPD Pocket 4 have, is similar to what Framework has: a modular port, where you can keep the form factor but gain KVM, RS232, etc.The base variant of the Mecha Comet comes with very little storage and RAM:> This is the base variant with 2GB RAM and 64GB Storage.And a relatively slow i.MX8. If you want to go with the quicker i.MX95 you're better off with:> This is the base variant with 4GB RAM and 64GB Storage.But that one is 50 EUR more, and still comes with only 64 GB storage and 4 GB RAM. My GPD Pocket 2 in 2018 came with 8 GB RAM and 128 GB storage (which isn't much nowadays).As for the screen in that machine, compare:> 6th generation Corning Gorilla Glass, AF anti-fingerprint coating, 10-point touch, 500 nits brightnesswith> 3.92\" AMOLED Display (550 nits), Capacitive TouchThe screen of this machine, while small (4\") seems quite decent.And if you want to emulate any Android apps which are ARM (which you could with Waydroid, if you have pref. 8 GB RAM on your machine), then you better run ARM. You can emulate x86-64 on ARM with decent performance (tried recently with Qemu on a RPi 4, and my daily driver is a MBP M1 variant) but the other way around is not feasible.",

So it is very likely that the support will be dropped from the mainline kernel way before 2033, as there probably won't be any users of this device remaining, and the original developers long gone.Call me negative, but I expect that this company wil just vanish after some time.

Same task, same context, different day, different results. The model's having a bad afternoon. The tool API is slow. Rate limits bite you. Something in the prompt format changed upstream.The context problem is solvable with engineering. The reliability problem requires treating your agent like a distributed system: canary paths, automatic failover, continuous health checks. Most of the effort in production agents isn't \"how do I give it the right info?\" It's \"how do I handle when things work 85% of the time instead of 95%?\"",

Want the smallest possible local dot product of gravity vector and magnetic field for an ordinary top (without considering \"sideways\" tops), which may lead to better performance in some locations on Earth (could map this with e.g. IGRF). 3D field actuation would be beneficial to allow higher efficiency and longer periods of actuation around the window where the Earth's magnetic field is maximized in the spun plane, while minimizing imbalance: this actuation timing is probably the only strategy that would make practical sense for most of the magnetic power, because you will need to take a break once in a while for sensing. Another practically difficult part would be avoiding on-board soft iron noise in magnetic field, because higher spin speed would require the device and environment to damp out the device-induced magnetic field at a higher minimum rate to afford any budget for accurate sensing of the background field during the \"off\"-time. That is: sensing trades with spin speed because it takes non-zero time and requires a stable environment.To implement this, I think you'd first want to test in a controlled environment with a larger magnetic field and then gradually turn down the applied field until it is Earth-like. I am honestly unsure whether you could practically get there, so earlier I used the words \"maybe could\", but humans are crazy so I appended the \"probably\".This would be a fun YouTube video to watch.",
