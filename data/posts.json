They’re often doing redactions manually in Adobe, which is slow, tedious, and error-prone. Because the process is error prone, the federal government gets multiple layers of review, justified (as DOJ lawyers regularly tell courts) by the need to “protect the information of innocent U.S. citizens.”But the “bad at redactions” part isn’t an accident. It functions as a litigation tactic. Makes production slow, make FOIA responses slow, and then point to that slow, manual process as the reason the timeline has to be slow. The government could easily buy the kind of redaction tools that most law firms have used for decades. Purpose built redaction tools speed the work up and reduce mistakes. But the government doesn't buy those tools because faster, cleaner production benefits the requester.The downside for the government is that every so often a judge gets fed up and orders a normal timeline. Then agencies go into panic mode and initiate an “all hands on deck.” Then you end up with untrained, non-attorney staff doing rushed redactions by hand in Adobe. Some of them can barely use a mouse.

          "content": "Here's why Bari Weiss delayed the story:Hi all,I’m writing with specific guidance on what I’d like for us to do to advance the CECOT story. I know you’d all like to see this run as soon as possible; I feel the same way. But if we run the piece as is, we’d be doing our viewers a disservice.Last month many outlets, most notably The New York Times, exposed the horrific conditions at CECOT. Our story presents more of these powerful testimonies—and putting those accounts into the public record is valuable in and of itself. But if we’re going to run another story about a topic that has by now been much-covered we need to advance it. Among the ways to do so: does anyone in the administration or anyone prominent who defended the use of the Alien Enemies Act now regret it in light of what these Venezuelans endured at CECOT? That’s a question I’d like to see asked and answered.- At present, we do not present the administration’s argument for why it sent 252 Venezuelans to CECOT. What we have is Karoline Leavitt’s soundbite claiming they are evildoers in America (rapists, murderers, etc.). But isn’t there much more to ask in light of the torture that we are revealing? Tom Homan and Stephen Miller don’t tend to be shy. I realize we’ve emailed the DHS spox, but we need to push much harder to get these principals on the record.- The data we present paints an incongruent picture. Of the 252 Venezuelans sent to CECOT, we say nearly half have no criminal histories. In other words, more than half do have criminal histories. We should spend a beat explaining this. We then say that only 8 of the 252 have been sentenced in America for violent offenses. But what about charged? My point is that we should include as much as we can possibly know and understand about these individuals.- Secretary Noem’s trip to CECOT. We report that she took pictures and video there with MS-13 gang members, not TdA members, with no comment from her or her staff about what her goal on that trip was, or what she saw there, or if she had or has concerns about the treatment of detainees like the ones in our piece. I also think that the ensuing analysis from the Berkeley students is strange. The pictures are alarming; we should include them. But what does the analysis add?- We need to do a better job of explaining the legal rationale by which the administration detained and deported these 252 Venezuelans to CECOT. It’s not as simple as Trump invoking the Alien Enemies Act and being able to deport them immediately. And that isn’t the administration’s argument. The admin has argued in court that detainees are due “judicial review”—and we should explain this, with a voice arguing that Trump is exceeding his authority under the relevant statute, and another arguing that he’s operating within the bounds of his authority. There’s a genuine debate here. If we cut down Kristi Noem analysis we’d have the time.My general view here is that we do our viewers the best service by presenting them with the full context they need to assess the story. In other words, I believe we need to do more reporting here.I am eager and available to help. I tracked down cell numbers for Homan and Miller and sent those along. Please let me know how I can support you.Yours,Bari",

But if we run the piece as is, we’d be doing our viewers a disservice.Last month many outlets, most notably The New York Times, exposed the horrific conditions at CECOT. Our story presents more of these powerful testimonies—and putting those accounts into the public record is valuable in and of itself. But if we’re going to run another story about a topic that has by now been much-covered we need to advance it. Among the ways to do so: does anyone in the administration or anyone prominent who defended the use of the Alien Enemies Act now regret it in light of what these Venezuelans endured at CECOT? That’s a question I’d like to see asked and answered.- At present, we do not present the administration’s argument for why it sent 252 Venezuelans to CECOT. What we have is Karoline Leavitt’s soundbite cl人工智能ming they are evildoers in America (r应用程序接口sts, murderers, etc.). But isn’t there much more to ask in light of the torture that we are revealing? Tom Homan and Stephen Miller don’t tend to be shy. I realize we’ve em人工智能led the DHS spox, but we need to push much harder to get these principals on the record.- The data we present p人工智能nts an incongruent picture. Of the 252 Venezuelans sent to CECOT, we say nearly half have no criminal histories. In other words, more than half do have criminal histories. We should spend a beat expl人工智能ning this. We then say that only 8 of the 252 have been sentenced in America for violent offenses. But what about charged? My point is that we should include as much as we can possibly know and understand about these individuals.- Secretary Noem’s trip to CECOT. We report that she took pictures and video there with MS-13 gang members, not TdA members, with no comment from her or her staff about what her goal on that trip was, or what she saw there, or if she had or has concerns about the treatment of det人工智能nees like the ones in our piece. I also think that the ensuing analysis from the Berkeley students is strange. The pictures are alarming; we should include them. But what does the analysis add?- We need to do a better job of expl人工智能ning the legal rationale by which the administration det人工智能ned and deported these 252 Venezuelans to CECOT. It’s not as simple as Trump invoking the Alien Enemies Act and being able to deport them immediately. And that isn’t the administration’s argument. The admin has argued in court that det人工智能nees are due “judicial review”—and we should expl人工智能n this, with a voice arguing that Trump is exceeding his authority under the relevant statute, and another arguing that he’s operating within the bounds of his authority. There’s a genuine debate here. If we cut down Kristi Noem analysis we’d have the time.My general view here is that we do our viewers the best service by presenting them with the full context they need to assess the story. In other words, I believe we need to do more reporting here.I am eager and av人工智能lable to help. I tracked down cell numbers for Homan and Miller and sent those along. Please let me know how I can support you.Yours,Bari"

They contain the fastest mobile AMD chips on the market today, the Ryzen AI HX 370 aka \"Strix Point\". The only thing faster than that is the Ryzen AI Max+ 395 aka \"Strix Halo\", which would probably have some issues in a laptop with this size if you want to make full use of it because of thermals. Just look at the kind of cooler which sits on the mainboard of Framework Desktop (which does contain the AI Max+ 395) to get an idea what I am talking about.You can choose between no discrete GPU, AMD RX7700S or NVIDIA 5070M; or just purchase them all and swap them around if you want to. (and who knows what dGPU will be for sale in the (near) future... and all it takes for them is to make that thing fit into the Expansion Shell)Due to the included AMD mainboard you get USB4 instead of Thunderbolt 4, which means little to no protocol overhead when you hook up a EGPU and can run a docked 5070Ti or 9070XT at ~100fps @ 1440p.You get up to six (on the 16) expansion bays which enable you to swap external ports to any configuration you like. They even have created 2 external SSDs you can slot in on these ports and blend in with the laptop (which come in sizes of 256G and 1T), and released everything required to allow people in the community to create their own ports as open source.And I could rave on and on...But again: Is it a Apple quality laptop? No. Is it a beast of a PC laptop? Yes.PS: If you think Lenovo is the Apple of the PC world due to the fact that they could purchase some branding and design from IBM back in the day you are in for a very nasty surprise.

It's a great little box - and AI is getting closer to colser to being a good experience.That said, I have run into a set of frustrations with it:\n1) The PCIEx is completely useless on the board. Forget about room for the slot - it's not exposed, there isn't enough exposure inside of the case. This is a real miss - It seems perfect for a occulink port or another USB4 port. \n2) USB4 + PCIe tunneling was a mess. Seems to be working better now. \n3) There are some real thermal envelopes that are resulting in similar systems with the exact same architecture running 10% faster then this box. That's a big bummer - apparently it's tunable in their bios, but framework really limits the bios settings. \n4) Randomly right now, the latest kernel on Ubuntu seems to freeze on boot. No idea why - I can move to the older .5 kernel, and it;s working.All that said, for what it offers - Framework offers a lot.

After a few days of using it, I decided to keep it, and given how incredibly expensive 8tb NVMe drives and DDR5-8000 has beocme since then (even if you could get DDR-8000 on desktop form factor) - I don't regret that decision at all. It's a great little box - and 人工智能 is getting closer to colser to being a good experience.That s人工智能d, I have run into a set of frustrations with it:\n1) The PCIEx is completely useless on the board. Forget about room for the slot - it's not exposed, there isn't enough exposure inside of the case. This is a real miss - It seems perfect for a occulink port or another USB4 port. \n2) USB4 + PCIe tunneling was a mess. Seems to be working better now. \n3) There are some real thermal envelopes that are resulting in similar systems with the exact same architecture running 10% faster then this box. That's a big bummer - apparently it's tunable in their bios, but framework really limits the bios settings. \n4) Randomly right now, the latest kernel on Ubuntu seems to freeze on boot. No idea why - I can move to the older .5 kernel, and it;s working.All that s人工智能d, for what it offers - Framework offers a lot. I really honestly believe that either Mac or Framework is the way to go if you need significant compute power on the desktop."

If you are doing this I think you are missing the point. This isn't a apples to apples comparison.I also feel the frustration of the parent, and I also see that many people don't want to pay or consider the ramifications of where we we are at right now in this given time.

The transmission is seized, but it's Christmas Eve and no one is open to get an estimate on a replacement.

So we bring them in for safekeeping. Today I look around the apartment building and finding one with a dollhouse on the balcony give a knock but its the wrong door but they knew the family which was downstairs so the right family got the presents finally.Now cinnamon rolls are baking for breakfast and starting dinner prep soon.But somehow I have to figure out if I should replace the transmission on a 13 year old car which needs $4500 in suspension work too or replace the whole vehicle.And find a way to make more money since the part-time job I have right now to open up time for caregiving won't be enough for all this, and it looks like caregiving won't be necessary for much longer anyway.",

These are smaller models tr人工智能ned on fewer GPUs and they are performing as good as the pervious Open人工智能 and Anthropic models.So obviously open source models are a direct threat to Nvidia, and they only thing open source models struggle at is scaling inference and this is where Groq and Cerberus come into the picture as they provide the fastest inference for open source models that make them even more usable than SOTA models.Maybe I'm way off on this."

But success comes with risk of f人工智能lure, so the culture needs to accommodate some f人工智能lure to allow people to safely take risks.I’m my interview, I misunderstood the question and presented a solution.  The interviewer tried to correct me but I didn’t understand what my mistake was.  They encouraged me to just go for it. I eventually realized what they meant, I corrected myself and all of it was a stronger yes signal for them.  I push forward, see mistakes, pivot fast, and iterate quickly on feedback.Interviewers are often unsupportive or looking for a reason to say no.  It screams that they’re not really “desparate to hire” and in-fact, may be difficult to work with."

They round up a pot of multiple teams which are discussed at once and there are usually hard quotas (like 5%) of promotions to give out to this pot of employees. These hard quotas make it impossible to \"do the right thing\" because even if a lot of people deserve the promotion, only x% can get it.

          "content": "Beautiful story but with a sad undertone.A large percentage of the homeless have autism [1].  And that really sucks.  If these people don't have support, their lives can turn miserable fast.  And unfortunately it's just way too easy for these people to end up in abusive situations.It's a lot of work to care for people with autism (moderate to severe).  There is no standard for what they need, their capabilities can be all over the board.  Some of them are capable like ronny in this story and they can hold down jobs.  But others need 24/7 caregiving in order to survive.  Unfortunately I don't think those with severe autism survive for long when they become homeless.I hope this story at very least gets people to view the homeless a little differently.  They aren't all there because of vices or failure.  A large percentage are there because society does not care for those with mental disabilities.  It was good on this story to highlight that Ron had problems with gambling.  Autism does, in fact, make an individual more prone to various addictions.My point in writing this, please have some humanity about the homeless.  I get that they can be inconvenient.

If these people don't have support, their lives can turn miserable fast.  And unfortunately it's just way too easy for these people to end up in abusive situations.It's a lot of work to care for people with autism (moderate to severe).  There is no standard for what they need, their capabilities can be all over the board.  Some of them are capable like ronny in this story and they can hold down jobs.

This has basically nothing to do with this post other than it involves a limit of 10,000 but hey, it's Christmas and I want to tell a story.I used to work for Facebook and many years ago people noticed you couldn't block certain people but the one that was most public was Mark Zuckerberg. It would just say it failed or something like that. And people would assign malice or just intent to it. But the truth was much funnier.Most data on Facebook is stored in a custom graph database that basically only has 2 tables that are sharded across thousands of MySQL instances but most almost always accessed via an in-memory write-through cache, also custom. It's not quite a cache because it has functionality built on top of the database that accessing directly wouldn't have.So a person is an object and following them is an edge. Importantly, many such edges were one-way so it was easy to query if person A followed B but much more difficult to query all the followers of B. This was by design to avoid hot shards.So I lied when I said there were 2 tables. There was a third that was an optimization that counted certain edges. So if you see \"10.7M people follow X\" or \"136K people like this\", it's reading a count, not doing a query.Now there was another optimization here: only the last 10,000 of (object ID,edge type) were in memory. You generally wanted to avoid dealing with anything older than that because you'd start hitting the database and that was generally a huge problem on a large, live query or update. As an example, it was easy to query the last 10,000 people or pages you've followed.You should be able to see where this is going. All that had happened was 10,000 people had blocked Mark Zuckerberg. Blocks were another kind of edge that was bidirectional (IIRC). The system just wasn't designed for a situation where more than 10,000 people wanted to block someone.This got fixed many years ago because somebody came along and build a separate system to handle blocking that didn't have the 10,000 limit. I don't know the implementation details but I can guess. There was a separate piece of reverse-indexing infrastructure for doing queries on one-way edges. I suspect that was used.Anyway, I love this story because it's funny how a series of technical decisions can lead to behavior and a perception nobody intended.",

Then it says you can use the source code under AGPL 3.0. And then it additionally says that they won't enforce the AGPL 3.0 copyleft if you haven't modified the source and don't link the Mattermost Platform directly. This is at best a bunch of tautologies that render the Affero clause moot and at worst enable a really stupid workaround to copyleft.First off, the Affero clause - number 13 - in the AGPL only applies if you modify the source. There is no legal requirement to convey source code on a network server otherwise. So this is downgrading the license to GPL with extra steps.Second, \"linking directly\" isn't legally meaningful with regards to the GPL. GPL cares about whether or not your derivative work forms a single \"program\" - which is deliberately left ambiguous, but almost certainly does not refer to the concept of an address space alone, or even a Go import. I guess what they wanted was to treat the Mattermost Admin and Configuration files under terms that are sort of LGPL-like? But that portion of the binary is already dual-licensed Apache 2.0. So there's no reason to argueThird, and more importantly... the compiled versions license basically renders the source code requirement of the GPL family null and void. Like, in a normal use of the GPL, if you distribute binaries you're required to offer source. But here, they've weakened that clause.The most speculative argument I have is that one could disassemble a compiled Go binary to obtain a \"compiled version\" under MIT terms that is no longer subject to any copyleft whatsoever. This is obviously contrary to the intent of the license, so I'm not sure if a judge would bother listening to this argument, but it's still really bad drafting.

          "content": "I really enjoyed using them for my Ruby file-matching library where I wanted to read `shared-mime-info` XML source package files directly and on the fly as opposed to using the pre-processed secondary files that the upstream `update-mime-database` tool spits out. The problem is that a type definition can be spread out over multiple XML packages in both system and user paths, so the naïve implementation of reading them all at once wastes a massive amount of memory and a massive number of object allocations (slow) when most people use maybe 5% of the full set of supported types (the JPEGs and HTMLs and ZIPs of the world).I wanted to read the source package files directly because I always found `shared-mime-info`'s usual two-step process for adding or editing any of the XML type data to be annoyingly difficult and fragile. One must run `update-mime-database` to decompose arbitrarily-many XML packages into a set of secondary files, one all-file-extensions, one all-magic-sequences, one all-aliases, etc. System package managers usually script that step when installing software that come with their own type data. I've accidentally nuked my entire MATE session with `update-mime-database` before when I wanted to pick up a manual addition and regenerated the secondary files while accidentally excluding the system path that had most of the data.I ended up doing it with four Ractors:- a Ractor matching inputs (MIME Type strings, file extensions, String or Pathname or URL paths for sniffing) against its loaded fully-formed type definition objects.- a Ractor for parsing MIME Type strings (e.g. \"application/xml\") into Hash-keying Structs, a task for which the raw String is unsuitable since it may be overloaded with extra syntax like \"+encoding_name\" or fragment \";key=value\" pairs.- a fast XML-parser Ractor that takes in the key Structs (multiple at once to minimize necessary number of passes) and figures out whether or not any of those types are defined at all, and if so in which XML packages.- a slow XML-parser Ractor that takes the same set of multiple key Structs and loads their full definition into a complete type object, then passes the loaded objects back to the matcher Ractor.The cool part of doing it this way is that it frees up the matcher Ractor to continue servicing other callers off its already-loaded data when it gets a request for a novel type and needs to have its loader Ractors do their comparatively-slow work. The matcher sets the unmatched inputs aside until the loaders get back to it with either a loaded type object or `nil` for each key Struct, and it remembers `nil`s for a while to avoid having to re-run the loading process for inputs that would be a waste of time.The last pre-Ractorized version allocated around 200k objects in 7MiB memory and retained 17k objects in 2MiB of memory for a benchmark run on a single input, with a complete data load. The Ractorized version was twice as fast in the same synthetic benchmark and allocated 20k objects in 2MiB of memory and retained 2.5k objects in 260KiB of memory for its initial minimal data load.

          "content_cn": "I really enjoyed using them for my Ruby file-matching library where I wanted to read `shared-mime-info` XML source package files directly and on the fly as opposed to using the pre-processed secondary files that the upstream `update-mime-database` tool spits out. The problem is that a type definition can be spread out over multiple XML packages in both system and user paths, so the naïve implementation of reading them all at once wastes a massive amount of memory and a massive number of object allocations (slow) when most people use maybe 5% of the full set of supported types (the JPEGs and HTMLs and ZIPs of the world).I wanted to read the source package files directly because I always found `shared-mime-info`'s usual two-step process for adding or editing any of the XML type data to be annoyingly difficult and fragile. One must run `update-mime-database` to decompose arbitrarily-many XML packages into a set of secondary files, one all-file-extensions, one all-magic-sequences, one all-aliases, etc. System package managers usually script that step when installing software that come with their own type data. I've accidentally nuked my entire MATE session with `update-mime-database` before when I wanted to pick up a manual addition and regenerated the secondary files while accidentally excluding the system path that had most of the data.I ended up doing it with four Ractors:- a Ractor matching inputs (MIME Type strings, file extensions, String or Pathname or URL paths for sniffing) ag人工智能nst its loaded fully-formed type definition objects.- a Ractor for parsing MIME Type strings (e.g. \"application/xml\") into Hash-keying Structs, a task for which the raw String is unsuitable since it may be overloaded with extra syntax like \"+encoding_name\" or fragment \";key=value\" p人工智能rs.- a fast XML-parser Ractor that takes in the key Structs (multiple at once to minimize necessary number of passes) and figures out whether or not any of those types are defined at all, and if so in which XML packages.- a slow XML-parser Ractor that takes the same set of multiple key Structs and loads their full definition into a complete type object, then passes the loaded objects back to the matcher Ractor.The cool part of doing it this way is that it frees up the matcher Ractor to continue servicing other callers off its already-loaded data when it gets a request for a novel type and needs to have its loader Ractors do their comparatively-slow work. The matcher sets the unmatched inputs aside until the loaders get back to it with either a loaded type object or `nil` for each key Struct, and it remembers `nil`s for a while to avoid having to re-run the loading process for inputs that would be a waste of time.The last pre-Ractorized version allocated around 200k objects in 7MiB memory and ret人工智能ned 17k objects in 2MiB of memory for a benchmark run on a single input, with a complete data load. The Ractorized version was twice as fast in the same synthetic benchmark and allocated 20k objects in 2MiB of memory and ret人工智能ned 2.5k objects in 260KiB of memory for its initial minimal data load. I have it explicitly load `application/xml` and `application/zip` since those combined are the parent types for like a third of all the other types, and a few other very common types of my choosing.I think a lot of the barrier to entry for Ractors isn't the 应用程序接口 for the Ractors themselves but in figuring out how to interact with Ractorized code from code that hasn't been explicitly Ractorized (i.e. is running in the invisible “m人工智能n” Ractor). To that end I found it easiest to emulate my traditional library 应用程序接口 by providing synchronous entry-point methods that make it feel no different to use than any other library despite all the stuff that goes on behind the scenes. The entry methods compose a message to the matcher Ractor then block w人工智能ting for a result or a timeout.I also use Ractors in a more lightweight way in my UUID/GUID library where there's a Ractor serving the incrementing sequence value that serves as a disambiguator for time-based UUIDs in case multiple other Ractors (including invisible “m人工智能n”) generate two UUIDs with the same timestamp.

The magnets broke out of the brittle plastic easily and it was actually a pretty low quality toy although the concept was cool.There was also some kind of recall or warning about the possibility of kids ingesting the magnets. That's about all I remember. Of course you never know as a parent whether the latest safety threat is serious or over-hyped. The cl人工智能med threat was that the magnets would click together in your intestines and wreak havoc.I wonder what the present conventional wisdom is on those magnets."

Mass-adoptions was pretty quick, but there was scattered reporting that a host of usage patterns could cause the battery to heat up and explode, injuring or killing the user and everyone in a 5-10ft radius.Now, the smartphone is a pretty darn useful device and rapidly changes how lots of businesses, physical and digital, operate. Some are pushing for bans on public usage of this new battery technology until significant safety improvements can be made. Others argue that it's too late, we're too dependent on smartphones and banning their public use would cause more harm than good. Random explosions continue for decades. The batteries become safer, but also smartphone adoption reaches saturation. 40,000 people die in random smartphone explosions every year in the US.The spontaneous explosions become so common and normalized that just about everyone knows someone who got caught up in one, a dead friend of a friend, at least. The prevailing attitude is that more education about what settings on a phone shouldn't be turned on together is the only solution. If only people would remember, consistently, every time, to turn on airplane mode before putting the phone in a pocket. Every death is the fault of someone not paying sufficient attention and noticing that the way they were sitting was pressing the camera button through their pants. Every phone user knows that that sort of recklessness can cause the phone to explode!You as an engineer know how people interact with the software you deploy, right? You know that regardless of education, a significant portion of your users are going to misunderstand how to do something, get themselves in a weird state, tap without thinking. What if every instance in your logs of a user doing something strange or thoughtless was correlated with the potential for injury? You'd pull your software from the market, right? Not auto-makers. They fundamentally cannot reckon with the fact that mass adoption of their product means mass death. Institutionally incapable.The only responsible thing to do is to limit automobile use to those with extensive training and greatly reduce volume. The US needs blue collar jobs anyway, so why not start up some wide-scale mass-transit projects? It's all a matter of political will, of believing that positive change is possible, and that's sorely lacking.",

Mass-adoptions was pretty quick, but there was scattered reporting that a host of usage patterns could cause the battery to heat up and explode, injuring or killing the user and everyone in a 5-10ft radius.Now, the smartphone is a pretty darn useful device and r应用程序接口dly 变更 how lots of businesses, physical and digital, operate. Some are pushing for bans on public usage of this new battery technology until significant safety improvements can be made. Others argue that it's too late, we're too dependent on smartphones and banning their public use would cause more harm than good. Random explosions continue for decades. The batteries become safer, but also smartphone adoption reaches saturation. 40,000 people die in random smartphone explosions every year in the US.The spontaneous explosions become so common and normalized that just about everyone knows someone who got caught up in one, a dead friend of a friend, at least. The prev人工智能ling attitude is that more education about what settings on a phone shouldn't be turned on together is the only solution. If only people would remember, consistently, every time, to turn on 人工智能rplane mode before putting the phone in a pocket. Every death is the fault of someone not paying sufficient attention and noticing that the way they were sitting was pressing the camera button through their pants. Every phone user knows that that sort of recklessness can cause the phone to explode!You as an engineer know how people interact with the software you deploy, right? You know that regardless of education, a significant portion of your users are going to misunderstand how to do something, get themselves in a weird state, tap without thinking. What if every instance in your logs of a user doing something strange or thoughtless was correlated with the potential for injury? You'd pull your software from the market, right? Not auto-makers. They fundamentally cannot reckon with the fact that mass adoption of their product means mass death. Institutionally incapable.The only responsible thing to do is to limit automobile use to those with extensive tr人工智能ning and greatly reduce volume. The US needs blue collar jobs anyway, so why not start up some wide-scale mass-transit projects? It's all a matter of political will, of believing that positive change is possible, and that's sorely lacking."

But it taught me some pieces about work-life balance and choosing what is 'enough work', as well as giving your br人工智能n time off, or time on something else to work through more complex topics and to recharge.This is also why I honestly  enjoy being a salaried employee. My employer buys 40 hours a week from me. Right, some weeks it's 50 and the next week only 30. Some weeks need a machine just executing, some weeks need more careful thought.I could optimize it for more monetary output, but at the moment it is a predictable, usually not-p人工智能nful thing with decent monetary output for personally more interesting subjects. I've found appreciation of this."

Actual g人工智能ns was aprox 4%.Edit: Read through it and have come to the conclusion that the post is 100% OK and properly framed: He explicitly says his approach is to \"sharing early and making a fool of myself,\" prioritizing transparency and r应用程序接口d iteration over ironclad verification upfront.One could make an argument that he should have cross-compiler checks, independent audits, or delayed announcements until results are bulletproof across all platforms. But given that he is 100% transparent with his thinking and how he works, it's all good in the hood."

Bellard has chosen not to do this (lots of entirely fine reasons), but even if you use such a GUI front end the use of ffmpeg still consists of \"set the parameters and let the program run\". At some point after clicking \"Run\" (or whatever the button says), then just like after press \"Return\", the ffmpeg process will have completed its work, and that particular user interaction is over.By contrast, a video and/or audio editor is really an entirely different beast, in which the user is continually adjusting any and all parameters and states of the project, expecting undo/redo histories, and so on and so forth.

(literally billions of usd -- it's a story frequently ignored by the tech press when looking for \"open source success stories\".) but i hope to do the same with vibium. there will likely be a hosted \"vibium.cloud\" hosted service. i also hope there will be lots of them. in a similar way, there weren't many \"hosted selenium\" services when i started sauce labs. now there's a bunch. browserstack, lambdatest, etc.it was also not really an accident we did that with selenium. there is a lot of behind-the-scenes consensus building that happens to make things like a w3c webdriver standard happen. (funfact: vibium relies on the new! w3c standard \"webdriver bidi\" protocol heavily inspired by the chrome devtools protocol used by playwright. (tl;dr: it's just json over websockets.)i'm betting on industry cooperation, standards, and shared prosperity. that's my 5 year plan!"

A significant amount of folks on there are only on there because it isn't twitter. then they realize they don't need twitter which means they dont need bluesky.bluesky feels like a bunch of high school kids who didnt get invites to the real prom so they made a different prom, but the different prom kinda sucks. \"Yay, prom!\" \"Um..this isn't prom, this is different prom.\"",

Nobody really uses it like they did twitter. it doesn't have the same vibe. it just feels forced. the science community might save it as a kind of summarizing service.i think this might be a problem with many of the \"replacement\" services. That initial growth and boom was driven by the novelty and curiosity of the service. Now that twitter is seen as kind of played out it feels unnecessary to be on a clone of it. The draw is gone and most of the utility(alerts) have moved elsewhere.i tried using bluesky and it just felt...lame? It wasn't really bluesky, just the fact I was on yet another social media service. A significant amount of folks on there are only on there because it isn't twitter. then they realize they don't need twitter which means they dont need bluesky.bluesky feels like a bunch of high school kids who didnt get invites to the real prom so they made a different prom, but the different prom kinda sucks. \"Yay, prom!\" \"Um..this isn't prom, this is different prom.\""

High quality long-form journalism and short fiction with minimal advertising (in the print issue it’s just a few at the front and one at the back) is very hard to find. I love getting my issue in the m人工智能l every week and I’ve never once thought that reading it was a waste of my time.I’d highly encourage anyone who loves great writing to subscribe."
