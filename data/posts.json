      "abstract": "该讨论围绕德克萨斯州起诉各大电视制造商监控用户观看内容的事件展开。核心争议在于智能电视通过自动内容识别技术收集用户数据的行为是否侵犯隐私。有用户指出这种做法与谷歌、Meta等公司收集数据并无本质区别，质疑选择性执法；也有用户强调缺乏明确法律监管会导致问题恶化，建议将电视作为纯显示器使用以避免监控。讨论中提到部分用户认为起诉动机可能涉及数据流向中国而非美国公司的政治考量，而非纯粹关注隐私保护。普遍共识是消费者应对智能设备的数据收集保持警惕，但分歧在于如何有效监管——有人认为需依靠法律介入，也有用户指出在固件不开放的情况下，物理断网是唯一可靠方法。此外，有用户批评企业将广告强加于已付费设备的行为，反映了对消费权益受损的普遍不满。",

These snapshots are scanned through a database of content and ads, which allows the exposure to be matched to what is airing. For example, if a streamer is watching an NFL football game and sees an ad for a hard seltzer, Roku’s ACR will know that the ad has appeared on the TV being watched at that time. In this way, the content on screen is automatically recognized, as the technology’s name indicates. The data then is paired with user profile data to link the account watching with the content they’re watching.https://advertising.roku.com/learn/resources/acr-the-future-...I wouldn't be surprised if my PS5 was doing the same thing when I'm playing a game or watching a streaming service through it.",

Without knowing how other counties score in terms of driver fatalities and THC, this is not really very useful.To me it sounds like an effort to paint THC as big and scary.  But in my experience living in a few large cities, weed is rare - but lots of people go out, drink, and drive home one or more times per week.ScienceDaily goes even further by rounding up to 50% and burying the location halfway down the summarization.\"Nearly half of drivers killed in crashes had THC in their blood\nTHC-impaired driving deaths are soaring, and legalization hasn’t slowed the trend.\nDate:\nOctober 5, 2025\nSource:\nAmerican College of Surgeons\nSummary:\nOver 40% of fatal crash victims had THC levels far above legal limits, showing cannabis use before driving remains widespread. The rate didn’t drop after legalization, suggesting policy changes haven’t altered risky habits. Experts warn that the lack of public awareness around marijuana’s dangers behind the wheel is putting lives at risk.\"Unless they publish who funded the study, I'm skeptical that the alcohol industry might be involved.  It's absolutely in their best interest to paint marijuana as the devil (and take attention away from alcohol).Obviously nobody should be driving with any impairment, but people do - driving tired, texting, even talking to passengers and turning their heads to look at the passengers while they talk!

Both _could_ be equal or even higher.I’m not sure one should blame (only) the researchers for these statements, though.

Since it's quite recent the introduction summarizes some of the most recent research.The things that jump out at me are:- [0]: Habitual users with baseline concentrations above legal limits perform just as well as habitual users with baseline concentrations below the legal limit, indicating that for habitual users, the legal limit doesn't have any relation to impairement.- [1]: A study in Canada analyzed crash reports and blood tests to look at the state of drivers responsible for accidents. While alcohol had a very clear and statistically-significant influence on the risk of a driver causing an accident, THC did not.To steelman the idea that THC causes accidents, [0] only looks at habitual users with baseline levels of THC and [1] only looks at non-fatal injuries.My conclusion right now is that the number of drivers in accidents with THC in their blood is going up because the number of people with THC in their blood is going up, not because drivers who use THC cause accidents.The law's assumption that this level of THC is evidence of impairment seems to be invalid.The law would be better off measuring impairment in some way and perhaps intensifying penalties when an impairment test fails and the user has THC concentration above some threshold.[0]: https://academic.oup.com/clinchem/article/71/12/1225/8299832...[1]: https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31106494/",

Similarly, the recall of Pamela Price started almost the moment she took office and was accompanied by a work slowdown by the OPD in the interest of making the crime situation look worse. There’s other examples, but effectively the police have turned lax enforcement into a tool to preclude any shifts in policing policies. I’ve got my own feelings about those policies, but when you’ve got the cops acting like a political block that gets to set policies instead of a group of city employees tasked with enforcing them, I think that should concern the rest of us.",

We know who these people are, we just don’t seem to have any motivation to actually do anything about it.The city has published research on this, showing drivers who get 30+ speed camera tickets in a year are 50x as likely to be involved in crashes with serious injuries or death, but efforts to actually do something about their behavior are consistently stalled or watered down.

There were also quite a few really old and niche records on there which possibly couldn't be put on streaming services due to the ownership of rights being unknown. It was the equivalent of vinyl crate digging without physical restrictions.Additionally there was a lot of discourse about music and a lot of curated discovery mechanisms I sorely miss to this day. An algorithm is no replacement for the amount of time and care people put into the web of similar artists, playlists of recommendations and reviews. Despite it being piracy, music consumption through it felt more purposeful. It's introduced me to some of my all time favourite artists, which I've seen live and own records and merchandise of.",

The convenience of streaming has lead to some interesting outcomes. When self-hosting music comes up this is always one of the top questions people have: How do you find new music?The answer isn't that hard and really hasn't changed much. People just don't want to spend any time or effort doing it. Music stores still exist, they're amazing. Lots of 2nd hand stores carry vinyl and CDs now, which can give you great ideas for new music. There are self-hosted AI solutions and tools. Last.fm and Scrobbling are still very much around.  My scrobble history is so insanely useful. There are music discords. Friends. Asking people what they're listening to in public. Live shows with unique openers(I once went to a Ben Kweller show with 4 opening bands, I still listen to 3 of them.)",

In 2025, raster formats remain way more accessible and easily shared than SVGs.This is very sad because SVGs often have way smaller file size, and obviously look much better at various scales.

If you need vms, object storage, load balancers, vpcs, etc., which is what most people would need, that works in a lot of solutions. And you can usually also find managed databases, redis, and a few other bits and bobs. If you like Kubernetes (I personally don't), the whole point of that is that it kind of works everywhere.People over pay for AWS mostly because of brand recognition. And it's not even small amounts. You get a lot more CPU/memory/bandwidth with some of the competitors. AWS makes money by squeezing their customers hard on that. Competitors do the obvious thing of being a bit more generous. Companies could save a ton just switching to competing solutions. Try it. It's not that hard. Some solutions are obviously not as complete.This not about US vs. EU but about sovereignty. If you are married to AWS, that's a weakness in itself. Ask yourself how hard it would be to move to Google cloud. Or Azure. Or whatever. If that's very hard, you might have a problem when Amazon jacks up the prices or discontinues a product.We use a mix of Google Cloud and Telekom Cloud for some of our more picky customers in Germany. Telekom Cloud is not very glamorous. But it's essentially openstack. Which is an open source thing backed by IBM and others.

We don't have any living Victorians to RLHF on: we just have what they wrote.To go a little deeper on the idea of 19th-century \"chat\": I did a PhD on this period and yet I would be hard-pushed to tell you what actual 19th-century conversations were like. There are plenty of literary depictions of conversation from the 19th century of presumably varying levels of accuracy, but we don't really have great direct historical sources of everyday human conversations until sound recording technology got good in the 20th century. Even good 19th-century transcripts of actual human speech tend to be from formal things like court testimony or parliamentary speeches, not everyday interactions. The vast majority of human communication in the premodern past was the spoken word, and it's almost all invisible in the historical sources.Anyway, this is a really interesting project, and I'm looking forward to trying the models out myself!",

We had the idea of AI and chatbots long before we had LLMs so they are naturally primed for it. It might make less sense as a communication style here and some kind of correspondence could be a better framing.",

Releasing a new interactive AI model is indeed different in significant and practical ways from the status quo. Yes, there are already-released historical texts. The rational thing to do is weigh the impacts of introducing another thing.2. Some people have a tendency to say \"release everything\" as if open-source software is equivalent to open-weights models. They aren't. They are different enough to matter.3. Rhetorically, the quote across comes across as a pressure tactic. When I hear \"are you going to do this or not?\" I cringe.4. The quote above feels presumptive to me, as if the commenter is owed something from the history-llms project.5. People are rightfully bothered that Big Tech has vacuumed up public domain and even private information and turned it into a profit center. But we're talking about a university project with (let's be charitable) legitimate concerns about misuse.6. There seems to be a lack of curiosity in play. I'd much rather see people asking e.g. \"What factors are influencing your decision about publishing your underlying models?\"7. There are people who have locked-in a view that says AI-safety perspectives are categorically invalid. Accordingly, they have almost a knee-jerk reaction against even talk of \"let's think about the implications before we release this.\"8. This one might explain and underly most of the other points above. I see signs of a deeper problem at work here. Hiding behind convenient oversimplifications to justify what one wants does not make a sound moral argument; it is motivated reasoning a.k.a. psychological justification.",

For example, we must be constantly reminded not to give LLMs a level of credibility that their hallucinations would have us believe.But I'm fascinated by the possibility that somehow resurrecting lost voices might give an unholy agency to minds and their supporting worldviews that are so anachronistic that hearing them speak again might stir long-banished evils. I'm being lyrical for dramatic affect!I would make one serious point though, that do I have the credentials to express. The conversation may have died down, but there is still a huge question mark over, if not the legality, but certainly the ethics of restricting access to, and profiting from, public domain knowledge.

I believe that for software engineers it's really easy to see if it's being useful or not -- We can just run the code and see if the output is what we expected, if not, iterate it, and continue. There's still a professional looking to what it produces.On the contrary, for more day-to-day usage of the general pubic, is getting really scary. I've had multiple members of my family using AI to ask for medical advice, life advice, and stuff were I still see hallucinations daily, but at the same time they're so convincing that it's hard for them not to trust them.I still have seen fake quotes, fake investigations, fake news being spreaded by LLMs that have affected decisions (maybe, not as crucials yet but time will tell) and that's a danger that most software engineers just gross over.Accountability is a big asterisk that everyone seems to ignore",

Yes they have improved, and there is more tooling around them, but clearly the difference between LLMs in 2025 and 2023 is not as large as 2023 and 2021. If there was truly exponential progress, there would be no possibility of debating this. Which makes comments like this:> The fundamental challenge in AI for the next 20 years is avoiding extinction.Seem to be almost absurd without further, concrete justification.LLMs are still quite useful, I'm glad they exist and honestly am still surprised more people don't use them in software. Last year I was very optimistic that LLMs would entirely change how we write software by making use of them as a fundamental part of our programming tool kit (in a similar way that ML fundamentally changed the options available to programmers for solving problems). Instead we've just come up with more expensive ways to extend the chat metaphor (the current generation of \"agents\" is disappointingly far from the original intent of agents in AI/CS).The thing I am increasingly confused about is why so many people continue to need LLMs to be more than they obviously are. I get why crypto boosters exist, if I have 100 BTC, I have a very clear interest getting others to believe that they are valuable. But with \"AI\", I don't quite get, for the non-VS/founder, why it matters that people start foaming out the mouth over AI rather than just using it for the things it's good at.Though I have some growing sense that this need is related to another trend I've personally started with witness: AI psychosis is very real. I personally know an increasing number of people who are spiraling into an LLM induced hallucinated world. The most shocking was someone talking about how losing human relationships is inevitable because most people can't keep up with those enhanced by AI acceleration.

Everyone forgets that losing money is an expected operating mode for a high growth startup. The models and hardware continue to improve. There is so much investment money accelerating this process that we have plenty of runway to continue improving before companies have to switch to full profit focus mode.But even if we ignore that fact and assume they had to switch to profit mode tomorrow, LLM plans are currently so cheap that even a doubling or tripling isn’t going to be a problem. So what if the monthly plans start at $40 instead of $20 and the high usage plans go from $200 to $400 or even $600? The people using these for their jobs paying $10K or more per month can absorb that.That’s not going to happen, though. If all model progress stopped right now the companies would still be capturing cheaper compute as data center buildouts were completed and next generation compute hardware was released.I see these predictions as the current equivalent of all of the predictions that Uber was going to collapse when the VC money ran out. Instead, Uber quietly settled into steady operation, prices went up a little bit, and people still use Uber a lot.

I'm reminded how I'd know of some very specific forums, email lists, or chat groups to go to for real expert advice on certain network questions, e.g. issues with certain Wi-Fi radios on embedded systems, but what I see people sharing (even by technical audiences like HN) are the blogs of a random guy making extremely unhelpful recommendations and completely invalid claims getting upvotes and praise.With things like asking AI for medical advice... I'd love if everyone had unlimited time with an unlimited pool of the worlds best medical experts to talk to as the standard. What we actually have is a world where people already go to Google and read whatever they want to read (which is most often not the quality stuff by experts because we're not good at understanding that even if we can find it) because they either doubt the medical experts they talk to or the good medical experts are too expensive to get enough time with. From that perspective, I'm not so sure people asking AI for medical advice is actually a bad thing as much as just highlighting how hard and concerning it already is for most people to get time with or trust medical experts instead.",

Indeed, the whole point of the Chinese Room thought experiment was to consider if that distinction even mattered.When it comes to of being able to do novel tasks on known knowledge, they seem to be quite good. One also needs to consider that problem-solving patterns are also a kind of (meta-)knowledge that needs to be taught, either through imitation/memorisation (Supervised Learning) or through practice (Reinforcement Learning). They can be logically derived from other techniques to an extent, just like new knowledge can be derived from known knowledge in general, and again LLMs seem to be pretty decent at this, but only to a point.

This by definition makes it intelligent and it makes it so we know the LLM understands the problem it was given. it would be This by definition makes it intelligent, and it makes it so we know the LLM understands the problem it was given. It would be disingenuous for me not to mention how wrong and how much an LLM hallucinates, so obviously the thing has flaws and is not super intelligence. But you have to judge the entire spectrum of what it does. It gets things right and it gets things wrong and getting something complex right makes it intelligent while getting something wrong does not predude it from intelligence.Second most non skeptics aren't saying all human work is going to be obsolete. no one can predict the future. But you've got to be blind if you don't see the trendline of progress. Literally look at the progress of AI for the past 15 years. You have to be next level delusional if you can't project another 15 years and see that obviously a super intelligence or at least an intelligence comparable to humans is not a reasonable prediction. Most skeptics like you ignore the trendline and cling to what Yann lecunn said about llms being stochastic parrots. It is very likely something with human intelligence exists in the future and in our lifetimes, whether or not its an LLM remains to be seen but we can't ignore where the trendlines are pointing.",

I tried to explore some other solutions, but found out the lack of a high level design really makes the HA for PostgreSQL really hard if not impossible. For example, without the necessary information in WAL, it's hard to enforce primary node even with an external Raft/Paxos coordinator. I wrote some of them down in this blog (https://www.binwang.me/2025-08-13-Why-Consensus-Shortcuts-Fa...) especially in the section \"Highly Available PostgreSQL Cluster\" and \"Quorum\".My theory of why Postgres is still getting the hype is either people don't know the problem, or it's acceptable on some level. I've worked in a team that maintains the in house database cluster (even though we were using MySQL instead of PostgreSQL) and the HA story was pretty bad. But there were engineers manually recover the data lost and resolve data conflicts, either from the recovery of incident or from customer tickets. So I guess that's one way of doing business.",

The \"cloud\" reducing staff costs is and was always a lie.This doesn’t make sense as an argument. The reason the cloud is more complex is because that complexity is available. Under a certain size, a large number of cloud products simply can’t be managed in-house (and certainly not altogether).Also your argument is incorrect in my experience.At a smaller business I worked at, I was able to use these services to achieve uptime and performance that I couldn’t achieve self-hosted, because I had to spend time on the product itself. So yeah, we’d saved on infrastructure engineers.At larger scales, what your false dichotomy suggests also doesn’t actually happen. Where I work now, our data stores are all self-managed on top of EC2/Azure, where performance and reliability are critical. But we don’t self-host everything. For example, we use SES to send our emails and we use RDS for our app DB, because their performance profiles and uptime guarantees are more than acceptable for the price we pay. That frees up our platform engineers to spend their energy on keeping our uptime on our critical services.",

Whether you can maximize what you get via leverage depends on how good your team is.US companies typically like to minimize headcount (either through accounting tricks or outsourcing) so usually using a Cloud Provider wins out for this reason alone.

In the SQL world, people are used to accepting the absence of real HA (resilience to failure, where transactions continue without interruption) and instead rely on fast DR (stop the service, recover, check for data loss, start the service). In practice, this means that all connections are rolled back, clients must reconnect to a replica known to be in synchronous commit, and everything restarts with a cold cache.Yet they still call it HA because there's nothing else.\nEven a planned shutdown of the primary to patch the OS results in downtime, as all connections are terminated. The situation is even worse for major database upgrades: stop the application, upgrade the database, deploy a new release of the app because some features are not compatible between versions, test, re-analyze the tables, reopen the database, and only then can users resume work.Everything in SQL/RDBMS was thought for a single-node instance, not including replicas. It's not HA because there can be only one read-write instance at a time. They even claim to be more ACID than MongoDB, but the ACID properties are guaranteed only on a single node.One exception is Oracle RAC, but PostgreSQL has nothing like that. Some forks, like YugabyteDB, provide real HA with most PostgreSQL features.About the hype: many applications that run on PostgreSQL accept hours of downtime, planned or unplanned. Those who run larger, more critical applications on PostgreSQL are big companies with many expert DBAs who can handle the complexity of database automation. And use logical replication for upgrades. But no solution offers both low operational complexity and high availability that can be comparable to MongoDB",

This happened 4–5 years ago.Apparently, during a recent review, they decided this counted as fraud and banned my account. As a result, I can no longer log in and lost access to all my Kindle e-books. They also remotely wiped my Kindle, so my entire library is gone. I appealed the decision, but I’ve been waiting for over six months with no resolution.",

It's still a great machine, but the Kindle is definitely superior for feel and visuals, but I use the Kobo 95% of the time. They are way more open with the software and I have mine in \"sideload\" mode (an official setting), which really just means that it doesn't make me log into anything and it doesn't even attempt to connect to the internet. Also, I can purchase a DRM free ebook on the train, plug a USB cable into my phone and my Kobo, and then load it on like that. Now I own my digital book, have supported the author with a larger margin, and get to read it on my more private machine.Definitely not a no-brainer for everyone, but I'm happy with my Kobo.",

If you really wanted it to your router could do the same thing for IPv6.IPv6 also has local addresses, but a lot more of them. Anything starting with fd00::/8 is a local address with 40 bits available as the network number. So you can set up your local network with the prefix fdXX:XXXX:XXXX::/48 (where the Xs are chosen randomly) as the prefix and still have 16 bits left over for different subnets if you want. These addresses do not change when your ISP changes your public prefix.And if you want to add reverse dns for SLAAC addresses then just have your router listen for ICMPv6 Neighbor Announcement addresses and use them to update your DNS server as appropriate. Or configure your servers to use stable addresses based on their MAC address rather than random addresses (which are better for privacy), and then just configure the DNS as you add and remove servers.",

This used to be the business model. For online orders, they could purge everything after the return window passed. The order data shouldn’t be needed after that. For brick and mortar, it should be a very straightforward business. However, I’m routinely asked for my zip code or phone number when I check out at stores. Loyalty cards are also a way to incentivize customers to give up this data (https://xkcd.com/2006/).TVs are another big one. They are all “smart” now, and collect significant amounts of data. I don’t know anyone who would be upset with a simple screen that just let you change inputs and brightness settings, and let people plug stuff into it. Nothing needs to be collected or phone home.A lot of the logs that are collected in the name of troubleshooting and bug fixing exist because the products are over-complicated or not thoroughly tested before release. The ability to update things later lowers the bar for release and gives a pass for adding all this complexity that users don’t really want.

          "content": "Hi all! Graphite cofounder Greg here - happy to help answer questions. To preempt one: I’ve been asked a few times so far why we decided to join.Personally, I work on Graphite for two reasons. 1) I love working with kind, smart, intense teammates. I want to be surrounded by folks who I look up to and who energize me. 2) I want to build bleeding-edge dev tools that move the whole industry forward. I have so much respect for all y’all across the world, and nothing makes me happier than getting to create better tooling for y’all to engineer with. Graphite is very much the combination of these two passions: human collaboration and dev tools.Joining Cursor accelerates both these goals. I get to work with the same team I love, a new bunch of wonderful people, and get to keep recruiting as fast as possible. I also get to keep shipping amazing code collaboration tooling to the industry - but now with more resourcing and expertise. We get to be more ambitious with our visions and timelines, and pull the future forward.I wouldn’t do this if I didn’t think the Cursor team weren’t standup people with high character and kindness. I wouldn’t do this if I thought it meant compromising our vision of building a better generation of code collaboration tooling. I wouldn’t do it if I thought it wouldn’t be insanely fun and exciting. But it seems to be all those things, so we’re plunging forward with excitement and open hearts!",

The fact it's a fork of VSCode (or whatever) will make me never use it. I wonder if they bet wrong.But that's just usability and preference.

          "content": "I’m working on something in a similar direction and would appreciate feedback from people who’ve built or operated this kind of thing at scale.The idea is to hook into Bitbucket PR webhooks so that whenever a PR is raised on any repo, Jenkins spins up an isolated job that acts as an automated code reviewer. That job would pull the base branch and the feature branch, compute the diff, and use that as input for an AI-based review step. The prompt would ask the reviewer to behave like a senior engineer or architect, follow common industry review standards, and return structured feedback - explicitly separating must-have issues from nice-to-have improvements.The output would be generated as markdown and posted back to the PR, either as a comment or some attached artifact, so it’s visible alongside human review. The intent isn’t to replace human reviewers, but to catch obvious issues early and reduce review load.What I’m unsure about is whether diff-only context is actually sufficient for meaningful reviews, or if this becomes misleading without deeper repo and architectural awareness. I’m also concerned about failure modes - for example, noisy or overconfident comments, review fatigue, or teams starting to trust automated feedback more than they should.If you’ve tried something like this with Bitbucket/Jenkins, or think this is fundamentally a bad idea, I’d really like to hear why.

It's significantly faster than using any other model, and it's clearly fine-tuned for the type of work people use Cursor for. They are also clearly charging a premium for it and making a healthy margin on it, but for how fast + good it's totally worth it.Composer 1 + now eventually creating an AI native version of GitHub with Graphite, that's a serious business, with a much clearer picture to me how Cursor gets to serious profitability vs the AI labs.",

From their info page [0], \"premium\" features include:  * Access to the ACM Guide to Computing Machinery\n  * AI-generated article summaries\n  * Podcast-style summaries of conference sessions\n  * Advanced search\n  * Rich article metadata, including download metrics, index terms and citations received\n  * Bulk citation exports and PDF downloads\n\nThe AI-generated article summaries has been getting a lot of discussion in my social circles. They have apparently fed many (all?) papers into some LLM to generate summaries... which is absurd when you consider that  practically every article has an abstract as part of its text and submission. These abstract were written by the authors and have been reviewed more than almost any other part of the articles, so they are very unlikely to contain errors. In contrast, multiple of my colleagues have found errors of varying scales in the AI-generated summaries of their own papers — many of which are actually longer than the existing abstracts.In addition, there are apparently AI-generated summaries for articles that were licensed with a non-derivative-works clause, which means the ACM has breached not just the social expectations of using accurate information, but also the legal expectations placed upon them as publishers of these materials.I think it's interesting that the ACM is positioning these \"premium\" features as a necessity due to the move to open-access publishing [1], especially when multiple other top-level comments on this post are discussing how open-access can often be more profitable than closed-access publishing.[0] https://dl.acm.org/premium[1] The Digital Library homepage (https://dl.acm.org/) features a banner right now that says: \"ACM is now Open Access.

Individual operations may well experience errors that are not error level log events for the overall program. You could say that an operation error is anything that prevents an operation from completing successfully, while a program level error is something that prevents the program as a whole from working right.This is a nontrivial problem when using properly modularized code and libraries that perform logging. They can’t tell whether their operational error is also a program-level error, which can depend on usage context, but they still want to log the operational error themselves, in order to provide the details that aren’t accessible to higher-level code. This lower-level logging has to choose some status.Should only “top-level” code ever log an error?  That can make it difficult to identify the low-level root causes of a top-level failure.

You can use the `cause` to hold a deep stack trace even if the error has been handled and wrapped in a different error type that may have a different semantics in the application.2) For logging that does not stop program execution, I think this is a great case for dependency injection. If a library allows its consumer to provide a logger, the application has complete control over how and when the library logs, and can even change it at runtime.

The important thing is what your program logs should be documented somewhere, the next most important thing is that your log levels are self consistent and follow some sort of logic, and that I would have done it exactly the same is not really important.At the end of the day, this is just bikeshedding about how to collapse ultra specific alerting levels into a few generic ones. E.g.

So using ethernet frames and lower layer rather than TCP.10G Thunderbolt adapters are fairly common. But you can find 40G and 80G Thunderbolt ethernet adapters from Atto. Probably not cheap - but would be fun to test! But ieven if the bandwidth is there we might get killed with latency.Imagine this hardware with a PCIe slot.

I was never under the impression they were destined for anything other than Apple datacenters though...As I mentioned above, it seems to me there's a couple of feature that appeared on the customer-facing designs that were inspired by what the datacenter people wanted on their own PCB boards.",

But these days, chips are usually already well tuned. You can feed double or tripple the power into the chip with adequate cooling, but the gain is so unremarkable. +10% +15% +20% is almost never going to be a make or break difference for your work, and doing so at double or triple the power budget is an egregious waste.So many of the chips about are already delivered at way higher than optimum efficiency, largely for bragging rights. The exponential decay of efficiency you keep pushing for is an anti-quest, is against good. The absolute performance wins are ridiculous to seek. In almost all cases.If your problem will not scale and dumping a ton of power into one GPU or one cpu socket is all you got, fine, your problem is bad and you have to deal with that. But for 90% of people, begging for more power proces you don't actually know jack & my personal recommendation is that all such points of view deserve massive down voting by anyone with half a brain.Go back to 2018 and look at Matthew Dillon on DragobflyBSD underpowering the heck out of their 2990wx ThreadRipper. Efficiency just soars as you tell the chip to take less power. The situation has not improved! Efficiency skyrockets today at least as much as it did then by telling chips not to go all out. Good chips behave & reward. I believe Apple competent enough to thoroughly disabuse this position that this chip would be far better if we could dump 2x 3x more power into it. Just a fools position, beyond a joke, imo. https://apollo.backplane.com/DFlyMisc/threadripper.txt",

It is easy to accidentally start again on the same line (and inspect the same elements), or skip one accidentally. Then navigating through the elements one by one requires a considerable amount of cognitive effort, your eyes bounce up and down constantly, and you end up inspecting the same elements multiple times.If you try to go top-to-bottom, lane by lane, you will then realize that the page also has infinite scroll and you will never go past the first lane.",

I'm very much a beginner in the CAD space and would love to understand what inspired you to build sdf.My basic understanding is that STL files are essentially like Bitmap images and store a list of triangles and their positions, whereas STEP files are more like Vector art where there is a list of instructions on how to build the model. Most CAD GUI programs also operate on a similar model to vector art where they record a list of operations one on top of another. It's why STEP files are a standardized format and can be imported / exported from most GUI based CAD builders. I think.Given that SDF also seems like it builds only STL files (I could be wrong), wouldn't learning build123d or CadQuery work better if one cares about compatibility with existing GUI based CAD modeling software?Additionally, atleast build123d offers a similar conceptual model to using Fusion360 and FreeCad - I have limited experience here - but essentially you sketch something in 2D on a particular plane, and then apply some operations to convert it to 3d in a particular manner - the simplest being extruding. This means the mental modeling of how to construct something is very similar across both GUI based CAD programs and Build123d, and that makes it easier for me to jump between GUI based and code based CAD modelling.I'd love to understand your point of view, and learn more.[0] - https://github.com/gumyr/build123d[1] - https://github.com/CadQuery/cadquery",

The last release was 2021 but they are still actively working on it and it's much faster now.I also have to recommend the BOSL2 library which means you don't have to implement all of those one million features from typical CAD software yourself.

I've been 3D printing for a while, but I never really got to a place where I could design interesting parts until I started to get the precision of doing models in code. Sometimes it is slower, for sure.Every time I've used as a CAD GUI program I would get to this point where I would need to alter a single dimension by 0.25mm and realize that _all_ of my fastener holes, cutouts, etc have to be nudged with the keyboard or mouse to accommodate it. The input devices lack precision for that kind of task, and having to repeat the operation dozens of times (or bulk select) gave me a terrible sinking feeling, and I'd often just step away and give up on the design at that point out of frustration. I try to approach everything in OpensSCAD in a way that means I never have to experience that feeling again.I will also say that doing everything from scratch in OpenSCAD would be it's own special kind of hell. Libraries like [BOSL2](https://github.com/BelfrySCAD/BOSL2) provide a good set of core ideas and preferences that help set you on a good path. A good example: BOSL2 shapes tend to have a \"center origin\" by default, which is different than the OpenSCAD default, but makes doing transforms later way easier.Anyway, happy to see OpenSCAD getting some attention here :)",

          "content": "Not just that but it also positions everything in absolute coordinates and does not have the ability to reason about solids, just surfaces. Basically if you want to model something like a bolt you need to create a cylinder for the shaft, a separate head of the bolt, and then a thread profile you can rotate around the cylinder. You must ensure there is enough overlap between these three separate parts so the resultant object is a single surface and not three separate ones.You can use modules to create a semblance of relative measurements but you still cannot do things like “attach this surface of object A to that surface of object B)”. In practice this means that if you want to create something like a spacer or a bracket you can do that easily enough. But if you want to make a part that matches some real world design you are stuck doing a lot of caliper measurements and math to try to create a part that lines up correctly. The you 3D print it and find that you positioned some hole based on its edge and not center and so nothing quite fits.OpenSCAD is easy to start but difficult to scale because of these limitations and because once you hard-code any measurement you are stuck with it. The “proper” way to do this is to give everything a variable but honestly that makes reasoning about how to line things up even more difficult. “Does base_width include the width of the vertical walls? What about the margin to make the parts fit together?”I have never been able to understand how things like FreeCAD lay out their UI. TinkerCAD is relatively simple but clearly a lot less powerful. I did try cadquery which solved a lot of OpenSCAD’s issues by having all offsets be relative by default but also introduces a few issues of its own.One tip I will give about OS: grab a copy of the latest beta/dev release. The renderer is several orders of magnitude faster.",

To quote:> In the example above, the second cube sits exactly on top of the first cube. This is something that should be avoided, as it’s not clear to OpenSCAD whether the two cubes form one object together. This issue can be easily solved by always maintaining a small overlap of about 0.001 - 0.002 between the corresponding objects. One way to do so is by decreasing the amount of translation along the Z axis from 10 unit to 9.999 units.This struck me when making the example in my post. In line 47 I specifically add 1 to heightCompartment to ensure the opening extends past the top of the main body. If I didn't do that, this happens during preview: https://imgur.com/a/Amc1dK6 (That's an exported image from the latest nightly of OpenSCAD.)But it doesn't happen during the actual render?Still, that just feels... like there's something going on with a floating point value or something which, programatically, is probably correct... But from the perspective of someone trying to design something feels Very Wrong. Because I have a 20mm high box, I subtract a 19mm high box from it, starting 1mm up from the base. Why shouldn't the top be open? Why is it acceptable for it to be maybe kinda open but broken by design?",

      "abstract": "该讨论围绕美国国家标准与技术研究院（NIST）位于博尔德的时间服务器因强风天气断电事件展开。核心话题是NTP（网络时间协议）服务中断的原因、影响及应对措施。\n\n社区主要观点包括：有人认为断电源于当地为预防野火而实施的主动停电，且备用发电机故障加剧了问题；也有用户指出事件暴露了机构灾难恢复计划的不足，对关键基础设施缺乏现场访问权限表示质疑。讨论中提到，部分用户关注此事的技术影响，询问是否可能引发连锁错误，但多数观点认为这属于可处理的临时故障，并非严重系统性危机。同时，有用户借机回顾了NTP协议创建者大卫·米尔斯的贡献，并分享了相关技术资料。\n\n普遍共识是极端天气与备用电源故障共同导致了服务中断，但对其潜在风险的评估存在分歧：一方视其为日常运维中的普通事件，另一方则担忧关键时间同步服务中断可能带来隐蔽的广泛影响。此外，有用户将此事与政府预算削减关联起来，提出了政策层面的质疑。",

          "content": "Think of it like this: overhead power lines require you to dig a 5-7’ deep hole that’s 2’ in diameter every 90’.\nUnderground power supplied through cable requires you to bury the cable minimum 3’ in the ground in rigid ductwork the entire 90’. Any time that cable runs under a roadway that ductwork needs to be encased in concrete. In urban and semi urban areas you also compete with other buried infrastructure for space - sewer, city/municipal infrastructure, gas, electrical transmission, etc.While underground distribution systems are less prone to interruption from bad weather it depends on the circuit design. If the underground portion of the circuit is fed from overhead power lines coming from the distribution substation you will still experience interruptions from faults on the overhead. These faults can also occur on overhead transmission circuits (the lines feeding the distribution substations and/or very large industrial customers).Underground distribution comes at a cost premium compared to overhead distribution. It’s akin to the cost of building a picket fence vs installing a geothermal heating system for your home. This is why new sub divisions will commonly have underground cable installed as the entire neighborhood is being constructed - there’s no need to retrofit underground cable into an existing area and so the costs are lower and borne upfront.It’s more cost effective for them to turn the power off as a storm rolls through, patrol, make repairs and reenergize then to move everything underground. Lost revenue during that period is a small fraction of the cost of taking an existing grid and rebuilding it underground. This is especially true for transmission circuits that are strung between steel towers over enormous distances.",

Some atomic clocks are more accurate than others, and an ensemble of these is typically regarded as 'the' master clock.To quote the ITU: \"UTC is based on about 450 atomic clocks, which are maintained in 85 national time laboratories around the world.\" https://www.itu.int/hub/2023/07/coordinated-universal-time-a...Beyond this, as other commenters have said, anyone who is really dependent on having exact time (such as telcos, broadcasters, and those running global synchronized databases) should have their own atomic clock fleets. There are thousands and thousands of atomic clocks in these fleets worldwide. Moreover, GPS time, used by many to act as their time reference, is distributed by yet other means.Nothing bad will happen, except to those who have deliberately made these specific Stratum 0 clocks their only reference time.

IIRC we could push about 5 gigabits of (not small) GET requests out of it, but something blocked it from reaching the 20-25 gigabits (on a 25g NIC) that MinIO could reach (also 50k STAT requests/s, over 10 nodes)I don’t begrudge it that. I get the impression that Garage isn’t necessarily focussed on this kind of use case.---In addition:Next time we come to this we are going to look at RustFS [1], as well as Ceph/Rook [2].We can see we're going to have to move away from MinIO in the foreseeable future.

I relied on minio's lifecycle management for that but it's feature missing in garage (and to be fair, most other) S3* no automatic mirroring (if you want to have second copy in something other than garage or just don't want to have a cluster but rather have more independent nodes)* ACLs for access are VERY limited - can't make a key access only sub-path, can't make a \"master key\" (AFAIK, couldn't find an option) that can access all the buckets so the previous point is also harder - I can't easily use rclone to mirror entire instance somewhere else unless I write scrip iterating over buckets and adding them bucket by bucket to key ACK* Web hosting features are extremely limited so you won't be able to say set CORS headers for the bucket* No ability to set keys - you can only generate on inside garage or import garage-formatted one - which means you can't just migrate storage itself, you have to re-generate every key. It also makes automating it harder, in case of minio you can pre-generate key and pass then fed it to clients and to the minio key command, here you have to do the dance of \"generate with tool\" -> \"scrape and put into DB\" -> put onto clients.Overall I like the software a lot but if you have setup that uses those features, beware.",

Users have reported that when using the LMDB database engine (the default), database files have a tendency of becoming corrupted after an unclean shutdown (e.g. a power outage), so you should take regular snapshots to be able to recover from such a situation.It seems like you can also use SQLite, but a default database that isn't robust against power failure or crashes seems suprising to me.",

With 1 crashed node, the cluster is still fully functional. With 2 crashed nodes, the cluster is unavailable until at least one additional node is recovered, but no data is lost.In other words, Garage makes a very precise promise to its users, which is fully respected. Database corruption upon power loss enters in the definition of a \"crash state\", similarly to a node just being offline due to an internet connection loss. We recommend making metadata snapshots so that recovery of a crashed node is faster and simpler, but it's not required per se: Garage can always start over from an empty database and recover data from the remaining copies in the cluster.To talk more about concrete scenarios: if you have 3 replicas in 3 different physical locations, the assumption of at-most one crashed node is pretty reasonable, it's quite unlikely that 2 of the 3 locations will be offline at the same time. Concerning data corruption on a power loss, the probability to lose power at 3 distant sites at the exact same time with the same data in the write buffers is extremely low, so I'd say in practice it's not a problem.Of course, this all implies a Garage cluster running with 3-way replication, which everyone should do.",

For an embedded KV store this is probably not the solution, but my understanding is that there are data structures like LSM that would result in similar robustness. But I don't actually understand this topic well enough.Checksumming detects corruption after it happened. A database like Postgres will simply notice it was not cleanly shut down and put the DB into a consistent state by replaying the write ahead log on startup. So that is kind of my default expectation for any DB that handles data that isn't ephemeral or easily regenerated.But I also likely have the wrong mental model of what Garage does with the metadata, as I wouldn't have expected that to be ever limited by Sqlite.",

And the only hope of that happening is for people to stay pissed.One thing I will say is the outrage about this has lasted longer than I initially imagined. America has had a lot of \"this controversy won't be forgotten!\" stuff that nobody remembers 2 months later. In contrast, I feel like this has been steadily ramping up and maintaining some degree of inertia for 2 years. Will it burn out by 2028? Honestly, I wouldn't be surprised.

So just the praise for cloning so quickly makes me sort of mad.You could theoretically make something like this that allowed log in so you got a personalized epstein mails, and then could do all that, and perhaps get more mails sent in as files get released, and perhaps create Google alerts on epstein in the news etc. that would come as mails and maybe the code could put news that came in, into the appropriate the tags etc.But until that time \"cloned\" is just very wrong.",

          "content": "My \"importance of privacy\" story:I get my gas and electricity from Scottish Power. Recently a rival company, Ovo Energy made a clerical error and sent me a bill, leading to a dispute. The front line of defence against this kind of dispute is that the bills give the serial numbers of the meters. The bill from Scottish Power gives the same meter serial numbers that are embossed on the front of my meters, and is therefore valid. The bill from Ovo Energy gives different serial numbers and is therefore in error.Picture though the internal processes in Ovo Energy. A second clerk is tasked with attending to the problem. He has a choice. He can change the address to agree with the meter serial numbers, correcting the error. Or he can change the meter serial numbers to those for my address, compounding the error.Since the meter serial numbers are confidential, to me and Scottish Power, Ovo Energy does not have the second option; they do not know the serial numbers (which are long, like a credit card number, not just 1,2,3,...). Thus the clerical error gets corrected, or just left, but not compounded.My guess is that confidential information, (such as meter serial numbers, credit card numbers, and account numbers), are the front like of defence against both clerical error and fraud based on impersonation. It is a rather weak defence, but it is light weight, and seems to how much of billing and billing disputes work.We all have lots to hide: the confidential information that the system needs us to keep confidential to stop clerical errors from compounding.",

In reality, both exist on a spectrum: privacy is controlled disclosure, shaped by what is shared, with whom, at what level of detail, and under what power asymmetry.Large surveillance systems inevitably build baselines. They don't just detect crimes; they detect patterns and anomalies relative to whatever becomes \"normal\".The problem with \"nothing to hide\" is that it defaults to maximal disclosure. Data is persistent, aggregatable, and reinterpretable as norms and regimes change. The data doesn't.This isn't purely individual. Your disclosures can expose others through contact graphs and inference, regardless of intent.

It will always be in some form of \"ok now we have to do this collective thing because of criminals, because of terrorism, because of protect the children, etc.\".\nIf you search \"nothing to hide, nothing to fear\" 100% of the results are about how it is a logical fallacy, nobody at all seems to defend the argument and yet, here we are!Food for thought:- this argument may well be stuck in the collective unconscious of lots of people (albeit in the religious context)- many governments, organizations and in any case the people in position of power and authority can develop a god complex (power corrupts etc.)So unless I end up dealing with an all-loving and all-forgiving entity I could fully trust, I'd like to keep my right to privacy, thank you very much![1] https://www.google.fr/books/edition/Sermons_on_the_Spiritual...",

      "abstract": "该讨论围绕“为SSD设计的数据库应具备何种架构”展开。核心争议在于传统数据库设计是否已适应SSD特性。有用户指出，SSD缩小了随机与顺序读写差距，但多数数据库仍过度优化吞吐量而非延迟差异和写入放大。针对持久性机制，一方认为单机磁盘提交已不必要，可通过跨存储复制保障；但反驳观点强调本地磁盘刷新仍有意义，因高端SSD写入延迟极低，且NVDIMM技术能进一步提升性能。讨论中还提到SSD写入耐久性问题，LSM树相比B树能降低写入放大，延长驱动器寿命。另有用户关注数据模型演变，认为关系模型虽适合传统业务场景，但可能不适用于LLM构建的非结构化世界模型，预测新型数据模型将兴起。共识在于，当前数据库设计与SSD物理特性存在错配，需重新思考架构以充分利用其低延迟、高并发特性。",

Suddenly you have to deal with way more data stored in multiple dimensions (platter, cylinder, sector) with wildly nonlinear access times (platter rotation, head movement).

However due to limitations in Postgres's storage engine API, you need to patch Postgres to be able to use OrioleDB.MySQL instead focused on pluggable storage engines from the get-go. That has had major pros and cons over the years. On the one hand, MyISAM is awful, so pluggable engines (specifically InnoDB) are the only thing that \"saved\" MySQL as the web ecosystem matured. It also nicely forced logical replication to be an early design requirement, since with a multi-engine design you need a logical abstraction instead of a physical one.But on the other hand, pluggable storage introduces a lot of extra internal complexity, which has arguably been quite detrimental to the software's evolution. For example: which layer implements transactions, foreign keys, partitioning, internal state (data dictionary, users/grants, replication state tracking, etc). Often the answer is that both the server layer and the storage engine layer would ideally need to care about these concerns, meaning a fully separated abstraction between layers isn't possible. Or think of things like transactional DDL, which is prohibitively complex in MySQL's design so it probably won't ever happen.",

These have different behavior than the N-dimensional spatial data types that everyone is familiar with, so you can’t use e.g. quadtrees as you would in the 2-spatial case and expect it to perform well.There are no algorithms in literature for indexing N-temporal types at scale. It is a known open problem. That’s why we don’t do it in databases except at trivial scales where you can just brute-force the problem. (The theory problem is really interesting but once you start poking at it you quickly see why no one has made any progress on it. It hurts the brain just to think about it.)",

Cursor was a good proof of concept but Claude Code is the tool that actually got me to use LLMs for coding.The kind of code that Claude produces looks almost exactly like the code I would write myself. It's like it's reading my mind. This is a game changer because I can maintain the code that Claude produces.With Claude Code, there are no surprises. I can pretty much guess what its code will look like 90% to 95% of the time but it writes it a lot faster than I could. This is an amazing innovation.Gemini is quite impressive as well. Nano banana in particular is very useful for graphic design.I haven't tried Gemini with coding yet but TBH, Claude Code does such a great job; if I could code any faster, I would get decision fatigue. I don't like rushing into architecture or UX decisions. I like to sit on certain decisions for a day or two before starting implementation. Once you start in a particular direction, it's hard to undo and you may try to double down on the mistake due to sunk cost fallacy. I try hard to avoid that.",

Cost is also why we specialize, in a group we can offload some intelligence to others.

          "content": "I have a PhD in high energy theoretical physics (hep-th for short) and I've written a paper on string theory, so I'd like to comment on some things:1. I think there are two reasons why string theory is cool (other people may have different opinions). Please note that none of these two reasons are directly related to the extension of Standard Model.\n1.1. String theory is the only theory so far that can mix gravity and quantum mechanics, and it can be even used to derive Hawking entropy of a black hole from \"first principles\" (see paper by Strominger and Vafa). The obvious trouble is that the black hole in question lives in five-dimensional space and is unrelated to the real-world black holes, but this is way better than what one can get from Standard Model physics (which is, no gravitons for you).1.2. Through AdS/CFT correspondence, string theory can be used to describe quantum field theories that are not related to string theory by themselves. This gives a very strong tool to study these quantum field theories, and the paper by Maldacena that discovered this correspondence is one of the most important papers in the field.2. It is true string theory is unusable as of now to derive the Standard Model physics (and provide extensions for it). Unfortunately, I would say that hardly any papers in high energy _theoretical_ physics currently address Standard Model physics. Roughly speaking, in late 1970s, after quantum chromodynamics was established and the asymptotic freedom was discovered, it turned out that it is extremely hard to compute many things we are generally interested in. At this point, high energy theoretical physics split in two sub-areas: phenomenology (which tries to extend the Standard Model to derive things like neutrino mass) and theory (which is a more formal theory and tries to answer questions like \"how to quantize gravity\"). One can argue that this makes hep-th an area of mathematics, and I would agree with that (eg in Cambridge theoretical physicists are in the same department with applied mathematicians).2.1. The things theoretical physicists study tend to pop up in various places, even if the original motivation is misplaced. Even the string theory itself originated as a way to explain the Regge trajectories (which were explained with quantum chromodynaics afterwards), and not to quantize gravity. For a more practical example, Witten introduced topological quantum field theories long before anyone understood how to apply them to real-world physics.3. I do not agree that string theory dominates the hep-th field. I would say that its popularity changes with the time, going up and down. While the main conference in the hep-th field is called \"Strings\", the talks at it are not necessarily related to strings theory, and at the 2025 conference I'd say that only 1/3 of the talks were anyhow related to the strings theory. Moreover, there is no hard division between people working on string theory and people working on other hep-th subjects, so that e.g. Witten made many contributions to hep-th which are not anyhow related to string theory.3.1. As for the push to do string theory that eg Sabine Hossenfelder alludes to, I'd say that I experienced no such push during my MSc and PhD studies. I've written four papers, and worked on a couple of projects that did not become a paper, and out of those, only one was dedicated to string theory.3.2. On the other hand, the more fringe theories that can provide alternative to string theory are also more high-risk endeavors (as you are quite likely to fail to produce anything coherent within a typical timeframe you allot to write a paper). Hep-th is strongly underfunded, and I believe, that with greater funding (and less need to publish-or-perish) some people would also pursue the more fringe directions in hep-th.3.3. A comment on the naming: hep-th is a field which is very hard to name. The name I use is the traditional one (and is used as eg a name for the field on arXiv). However, many things derived by the physicists in the field are not anyhow related to the high energy in the literal meaning of the words \"high energy\". When talking to people at a party, I say that I studied string theory, because the name is catchy and it rings a bell, but this way of referring to the field is definitely a misnomer.",

So today it's that framework that you can use to write any theory you want.That original theory was a good theory. Very compelling and just a small adjustment away from mainstream physics.

Conjecturing that some theory in the string theory landscape [0] gives a theory of quantum gravity consistent with experiments that are possible but beyond what humans may ever be capable of isn't as strong of a claim as it may first appear. The intuition I used to have was that string theory is making ridiculously specific claims about things that may remain always unobservable to humans. But the idea is not that experiments of unimaginable scale and complexity might reveal that the universe is made up of strings or something, it's just that it may turn out that string theory makes up such a rich and flexible family of theories that it could be tuned to the observed physics of some unimaginably advanced civilization. My impression is that string theory is not so flexible that its uninteresting though. There's some interesting theoretical work along these lines around exploring the swampland [1].[0] https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/String_theory_landscape[1] https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swampland_(physics)",

Sometimes having predictable timings (i.e. not a GC with pauses) is nice. I believe compiler and library support is also just better for many embedded platforms in rust.> networking type softwareRust is a much more aggressively optimizing compiler, and thus will typically be faster, in the places where that matters. GC pauses might also be a point against golang in some places here. Rust's idioms provide slightly less opportunity for bugs in places where reliability matters (e.g. having a type system that requires you check for errors instead of just patterns that encourage it).So there's a difference, but generally go is a good enough language for networking software and it would be rare that I wouldn't suggest that \"use what you know\" is more important than the differences between the languages for non-firmware network software.",

Perr-based routing is at least 50% of wireguard's value proposition. Having to reimplement it at the higher level defeats the purpose. No, obfuscation _has_ to be part of the same protocol as routing.(Btw, same sort of thing occurs with zfs combining raid and filesystem to close the parity raid write hole. Often strictly layered systems with separation of concerns are less than the sum of their parts.)",

      "abstract": "该讨论围绕Codex平台正式引入“技能”功能展开。核心话题是探讨技能这一新特性的技术定位、潜在优势以及与现有工具的区别。多数用户对技能的标准化和易用性表示认可，认为其基于Markdown文件的编写方式简单高效，且能利用现有工具链，长期价值可能超过MCP等方案。有共识认为技能有望成为类似开源库的标准化解决方案，由专家编写常见功能模块，降低开发门槛。\n\n主要分歧在于技能与现有工具调用的区别。有用户质疑技能与直接让模型读取文件并决定是否调用有何不同，也有用户指出技能规范的关键在于不依赖RAG处理内容，仅将技能名称和描述原样加入提示词来触发选择，这不同于传统工具调用流程。此外，有用户提到技能规范目前缺乏变量注入机制，例如数据库密码需每次提供或硬编码，限制了实用性。讨论中还提及技能可由AI代理自行编辑改进，体现了其动态扩展的潜力。",

          "content": "It's so nice that skills are becoming a standard, they are imo a much bigger deal long-term than e.g. MCP.Easy to author (at its most basic, just a markdown file), context efficient by default (only preloads yaml front-matter, can lazy load more markdown files as needed), can piggyback on top of existing tooling (for instance, instead of the GitHub MCP, you just make a skill describing how to use the `gh` cli).Compared to purpose-tuned system prompts they don't require a purpose-specific agent, and they also compose (the agent can load multiple skills that make sense for a given task).Part of the effectiveness of this, is that AI models are heavy enough, that running a sandbox vm for them on the side is likely irrelevant cost-wise, so now the major chat ui providers all give the model such a sandboxed environment - which means skills can also contain python scripts and/or js scripts - again, much simpler, more straightforward, and flexible than e.g. requiring the target to expose remote MCPs.Finally, you can use a skill to tell your model how to properly approach using your MCP server - which previously often required either long prompting, or a purpose-specific system prompt, with the cons I've already described.",

It works both on good sessions with new paths/functionality and on \"bad\" sessions where you had to hand-hold the agent. And they're pretty good at summarising and extracting tidbits. And you can always skim the files and do quick edits.Compared to MCPs, this is a much faster and more approachable flow to add \"capabilities\" to your agents.",

A dieta is kinda similar to fasting. You can't shower with soap, you can't have sex, you can't have too much salt/seasoning, can't be exposed to too much smoke, can't have alcohol, etc. And you use that specific plant throughout your time. Basically you want to eliminate any conflicting variables so you can experience the plant as purely as possible to understand its effects. Traditionally these dietas could last over a year but modern day maestros typically do them for just a few weeks.I don't really have a point to this.

          "content": "I applaud your efforts, but that seems difficult to me.  There's so much nuance in language, and the original spanish translation would even be dependent upon locale-destination of the original dictionary.  Which would also be time based, as language changes over time.And that translation is likely only a rough approximation, as words don't often translate directly.  To add in an extra layer (spanish -> english) seems like another layer of imperfect (due to language) abstraction.Of course your efforts are targeting a niche, so likely people will understand the attempt and be thankful.  I hope this suggestion isn't too forward, but this being an electronic version, you could allow some way for the original spanish to be shown if desired.  That sort of functionality would be quite helpful, even non-native spanish speakers might get a clearer picture.What tools are you using to abstract all of this?If the spacing and columns of the images are consistent, I'd think imagemagick would allow you to automate extraction by column (eg, cutting the individual pages up), and OCR could then get to work.For the Shipibo side, I'd want to turn off all LLM interpretation.  That tends to use known groupings of words to probabilistically determine best-match, and that'd wreak havoc in this case.Back to the images, once you have imagemagick chop and sort, writing a very short script to iterate over the pages, display them, and prompt with y/n would be a massive time saver.  Doing so at each step would be helpful.For example, one step?  Cut off header and footer, save to dir.  Using helpful naming conventions (page-1, and page-1-noheader_footer).  You could then use imagemagick to combine page-1 and -age-1-noheader_footer side by side.Now run a simple bash vet script.  Each of 500 pages pops up, you instantly see the original and the cut result, and you hit y or n.  One could go through 500 pages like this in 10 to 20 minutes, and you'd be left with a small subset of pages that didn't get cut properly (extra large footer or whatever).  If it's down to 10 pages or some such, that's an easy tweak and fix for those.Once done, you could do the same for column cuts.  You'd already have all the scripts, so it's just tweaking.I'm mentioning all of this, because combo of automation plus human intervention is often the best method to something such as this.Anyhow, good luck!",

Good for a rough search at least).I would love to create a json version of it that would essentially have a bunch of fields for each word (Shipibo/Spanish/English word/definition/example, type of word, etc). It's further complicated by how words can be modified in Shipibo (it's actually a very technical language- words can have any number of prefixes and suffixes tagged on to change their meaning and their precision. In their \"icaros\", the healing songs they sing in ceremony, the most technical use of the language is considered to be the most beautiful. Essentially poetry from their \"medical\" jargon).I've done some human-in-the-loop attempts but still come up short in one way or another (I end up getting frustrated and throwing my hands up after seeing how much time I dump on it). So I figure this will remain a good test as the tools (and my prompting abilities) get better. It's definitely not urgent for me.",

Maybe that sounds like a fun way to burn time for someone, but it doesn't sound like fun to me.)Or, you can accept that the world is corrupted -- and by extension, the cameras are also all corrupted.The safe solution is then actually pretty simple:  Use wired-only cameras that work with Frigate (or whatever your local NVR of choice may be), keep them on their own private VLAN that lacks Internet access, and don't worry about it.The less-safe solution is also pretty simple:  Do what everyone else is doing, and just forget the problem exists at all.  Switch your brain off, buy whatever, and use it.

Let's be very optimistic and say $5 per unit.That $5 per unit profit would mean an additional $100,000 invested in software development would be like taking 20,000 units of this camera and lighting them on fire. Or they could not do that and improve their bottom line numbers by $100,000.TP-Link has a huge lineup of products and is constantly introducing new things. Multiply that $100,000 across the probably 100+ products on their websites and it becomes tens of millions of dollars per year.The only way these ultra-cheap products are getting shipped at these prices is by doing the absolute bare minimum of software development.

He said I'd need to come round to his house to do this as he didn't want to provide access to the machine via the Internet. Fair enough.When he opened his front door the conversation went something like this:    Him: \"Ah hello, thanks for coming round to do this. It should be fun, come in and we can get started.\"\n    Me: \"OK, but I'm already done.\"\n    Him: \"What?\"\n    Me: \"I'm done. I've already got root on the machine and I left a little text file in root's home directory as proof.\"\n    Him: \"What? But ... what? Wifi?\"\n    Me: \"Nope. Let me in and I'll explain how.\"\n\nThe short story is he had an PoE IP-based intercom system on his front gate. I remembered this from when he was going on about his plans for his home network setup and how amazing PoE was and how he was going to have several cameras etc. I also remember seeing the purple network cable sticking out of the gate pillar whilst the renovation work was being done and the intercom hadn't yet been installed.I'd arrived 45 minutes early, unscrewed the faceplate of the intercom system and, with a bit of wiggling, I got access to a lovely Cat-5 ethernet jack. Plugging that into my laptop I was able to see his entire home network, the port for the intercom was obviously not on its own VLAN. Finding and rooting the target machine was a different matter but those details are not relevant to this story.I suppose I got lucky. He could have put the IoT devices on separate VLANs. He could have had some alerting setup so that he'd be notified that the intercom system had suddenly gone offline. He could have limited access to the important internal machines to a known subset of IPs/ports/networks.He learned about all of the above mitigations that day.I've always wondered just how many people have exposed their own internal network in a similar way when trying to improve their external security (well, deterrent, not really security) but configuring it poorly.",

If the camera is recording something in a public location and they don't mind the location being exposed and potentially the video feed (like plenty of live public cameras), then it shouldn't be an issue. Otherwise, they need to disable it until it gets fixed.",

Charles generates a root certificate that it uses to issue certificates for each domain in intercepts a TLS connection for and you need to install that root certificate in your OS such that your clients will trust that certificate. If you have a client that doesn’t use the Mac OS certificate store you may have to do some extra per client configuration.I also despise “security” tools that intercept and inspect TLS traffic (such as ZAcaler for example), but I find a Charles to be very useful for what it does and the TLS inspection support is easy to use and really helpful/necessary in some cases.",

I don't recall the reason - it might have been cost, but we used lots of paid tools, and since it was in the restricted category, we couldn't pick and use (we handled a copious amount of Western PII, from reading, working on it, to storing it). Two were approved: Requestly and another was a link to an internal wiki with a really \"interesting\" process involving Wireshark and whatnot. Needless to say, that doc was one of the most clicked and least read. I tried Charles at a later place that offered a license, and I went back to Requestly, which I really found to be more straightforward or simpler to use.",

They care about results, and the DMCA gets them exactly that.The phishing reports are interesting, providers aren't necessarily required to act as fast on those. Although, I suspect companies like Cloudflare who get used by countless phishers will probably also set up some kind of automated anti phishing system.",

You can drag down the bottom of the formula bar/field and make it multi-line2. You can insert arbitrary[*] newlines in an Excel formulaCombining those, you can turn the absurd default format of single-line-of-code functions into something readable and manageable. Here's a simple one from a spreadsheet I have open:  =INDEX(\n  $C$17:$S$24,\n  MATCH(A6,$A$17:$A$24,0),\n  MATCH(C6,$C$15:$S$15,0)\n  )\n\nAnd just think of highly nested functions. Once you know it, writing single-line functions of any complexity is absurd, as absurd as writing 'real' code that way.[0] Early shows how it was done: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46340638[*] I think you can do it anywhere but I haven't tested anything crazy; mostly I just use them between expressions.",

There were a ton of categories like CO2 dragsters (my favorite), architecture, 2D and 3D CAD, GIS, and numerous others I can't remember. Some categories had more of a business focus but most were science/engineering related. The 3D CAD one was pretty fun. I recall two parts. In the first half, you got a hand-drawn sketch of a bushing and had to recreate it in Autodesk Inventor as fast as possible and then generate a 2D drawing properly dimensioned (like what you'd hand to a machinist). The second half involved creating all of the parts for a basic ceiling fan and then making an animated exploded view that also spun the fan. I was really good at that stuff back then but I definitely wasn't the quickest. I'm sure it's a lot different now, so much of CAD now involved CNC and 3D printing that's there's probably aspects that include messing with gcode now.My GIS competition was fun too. They gave me a bunch of map data and I had to produce a report on Washington DC storm surge flood zones and potential rescue helicopter locations all within a couple hours.I recall there being a video production category too. I didn't compete in it but you'd be given props and dialogue to turn into a video over the course of a day or two.

With the maximum reasoning effort it's able to break out of the wrong route by rethinking the strategy. For example I gave it an onion address without the .onion part, and told it to figure out what this string means. All reasoning models including Gemini 2.5 and 3 assume it's a puzzle or a cipher (because they're trained on those) and start endlessly applying different algorithms to no avail. Gemini 3 Pro is the only model that can break the initial assumption after running out of ideas (\"Wait, the user said it's just a string, what if it's NOT obfuscated\"), and correctly identify the string as an onion address. My guess is they trained it on simulations to enforce the anti-jailbreaking commands injected by the Model Armor, as its CoT is incredibly paranoid at times. I could be wrong, of course.",

It had a real struggle trying to consolidate \"suspicious search results\" and even questioned whether it was fake news, or running against a simulation!, determining it wasn't going to fall for my \"test\".It did ultimately decide Ozzy was alive.

          "content": "This is exactly why I upgrade to the Pixel 10 Pro. On Black Friday, you could get a Pixel 10 Pro for about $450 on the U.S. Google Fi store (which sells unlocked phones)... which is also about how much a Pixel 9 Pro goes for on eBay; minus eBay fees and accounting for shipping, that's an upgrade for < $100. But, it's even better, the Pixel 10 Pro comes with a year of their \"AI Pro\" plan (which I believe costs around $240/year.) There is really, really no point in upgrading to a Pixel 10 Pro from a Pixel 9 Pro, and environmentally it pains me to be the person upgrading my phone on an annual basis (this is the fastest I've ever upgraded a phone, ever) but it's hard to turn down when Google is selling $800~ish for $400~ish.And yeah, it's not the insanely priced AI Ultra plan, but if there are any hard limits on Gemini Pro usage I haven't found them. I have played a lot with really long Antigravity sessions to try to figure out what this thing is good for, and it seems like it will pretty much sit there and run all day. (And I can't really blame anyone for still remaining mad about AI to be completely honest, but the technology is too neat by this point to just completely ignore it.)Seeing as Google is still giving away a bunch of free access, I'm guessing they're still in the ultra-cash-burning phase of things. My hope (hopium, realistically) is that by the time all of the cash burning is over, there will be open-weight local models that are striking near where Gemini 3 Pro strikes today. It doesn't have to be as good, getting nearby on hardware consumers can afford would be awesome.But I'm not holding my breath, so let's hope the cash burning continues for a few years.(There is, of course, the other way to look at it, which is that looking at the pricing per token may not tell the whole story. Given that Google is running their own data centers, it's possible the economic proposition isn't as bad as it looks. OTOH, it's also possible it is worse than it looks, if they happen to be selling tokens at a loss... but I quite doubt it, given they are currently SOTA and can charge a premium.)",
