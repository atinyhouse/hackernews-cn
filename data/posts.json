      "content_cn": null,
      "abstract": "该讨论围绕特斯拉4680电池供应链问题展开，核心话题是合作伙伴将29亿美元合同减记至约7400美元，降幅超过99.999%，引发对特斯拉电池技术进展和Cybertruck产能的质疑。  \n有人认为这暴露了4680电池量产困境，如生产缺陷率远高于传统电池，且Cybertruck年销量仅2万左右，与年产能25万严重不匹配，质疑市场分析失败。也有用户指出特斯拉可能正调整供应链，转向LFP化学体系或本土化生产，以减少对中国依赖。讨论中提到，部分用户对特斯拉长期承诺（如2.5万美元电动车）的实现表示怀疑，认为其估值缺乏支撑。  \n分歧点在于对特斯拉电池项目前景的判断：一方认为这是重大挫折，直接影响Cybertruck需求；另一方则怀疑媒体报道的片面性，认为特斯拉可能在为产能提升调整布局。共识在于合同减记幅度惊人，反映出合作方对项目价值的极度悲观。",

          "content": "I know there’s a lot of Tesla/Elon hate here. I’m not denying any of it. I’m just sharing a genuinely strange experience I wasn’t expecting.We needed a car again. Sold ours a year ago and got by with Uber, rentals, taxis. Life changed a bit and we needed something more predictable. I was planning to buy something used and boring and didn’t really care what.My wife asked, “What about an EV?” We can’t charge in our rental garage, but there’s a Tesla Supercharger literally across the street. Took a Tesla test drive mostly out of curiosity.And… I drove maybe 1% of that drive. The rest was on full self driving (FSD).Fast forward, I now own a Tesla, and about 99% of my driving is on FSD.Important context: when we picked it up, it was still on v13. It immediately made an illegal turn and scared some pedestrians in a crosswalk. So yes, I get the concern and skepticism. I had it too.Then v14.2 landed.Whatever they changed in that release feels real. It’s not just incremental. It feels like a different system. Elon says “we finally cracked it” (and probably says that all the time), so take that with a grain of salt, but with my very small sample size… it kind of looks like they might have.Two moments that really stuck with me:While self-driving, the car clearly anticipated a bus making a massive wide turn into our lane and hung way back until the maneuver was complete. It saw that developing long before I did.At ~70 mph, I was mid lane-change with my blinker on when a driver towing a large trailer decided to drift into the same lane without checking their blind spot. The Tesla instantly aborted the lane change and smoothly moved back, avoiding what would’ve been a nasty accident. No panic, no hard braking, no drama.I know this probably sounds like shilling. I’m not interested in the politics and don’t want to defend any of that. But it genuinely feels like stepping into the future, and honestly a much safer way to drive.I want Rivian, Waymo, whoever to nail this too. I hope they do. But right now, Tesla seems to actually have something that crossed a line from “demo” to “wow, this is real.”I didn’t expect to come away thinking that. But here we are.",

They still have some of the most efficient EVs available, and their UI/UX is still one of the best, but of course they'll face compeition, and of course their competitors will try to differentiate in all directions, and especially those that are superficially attractive (and less expensive to deliver) like interior design.2) Back in his earlier, pre-crazy days, Musk suggested (something along the lines of) that Tesla's goal wasn't to be a huge successful car company, so much as to prove that EVs were viable as everyday cars, and drive a revolution in the car industry.  By this measure, they've mostly succeeded.---Big picture, totally agree that Tesla seems to have lost its way over the past few years, which unsurprisingly correlates (to an outside observer) with Musk's apparent changes in judgement and behaviour, with its consequent impact on Tesla's image and desirability amongst consumers.

If every manufacturer does just that, then their screens will all look extremely similar.If your TV looks like everybody else's, how do you get people strolling through an electronics store to say, \"Wow!

Settings that make the image look less like the source, but which grab eyes in a store.  You make those settings the default too, so that people don't feel ripped off when they take the TV out of the store.If you take a typical TV set home and don't change the settings from default, you're typically not going to see a very faithful reproduction of the director's vision.  You're seeing what somebody thought would make that screen sell well in a store. If you go to the trouble of setting your screen up properly, your initial reaction may be that it looks worse.

          "content": "That may be a part of it, but I think for a lot of people the problem is how surround sound movies are processed.Voice comes through the center channel. Music tends to come out of multiple speakers, and so do a lot of explosions and sound effects.Most people don't have multi-channel setups at home. So you get everything coming out of 2 speakers or a sound bar.What that means, is that you get 4+ channels of music and sound effects mixed into 2 channels. So it ends up drowning out the single voice channel.When I play movies through Kodi, I generally go into the audio settings and turn up the center channel. This fixes the issue every time for me.",

Most native speakers seem to be convinced that vowels are the most important part of English, but I think it isn't true.  Sure, English has a huge number of vowels, but they are almost completely redundant. It's hard to find cases where vowels really matter for comprehension, which is why they may vary so much across accents without impeding communication.

With an LLM that's a single prompt and a couple of minutes of wait.Using LLMs to build black box abstraction layers is a choice.

I don't mean 'privacy' in an everyday sense -- i.e. things I keep to myself and don't share. I mean 'privacy' in a more basic sense: private experience -- sitting by oneself; having a mental space that doesn't include anybody else; simply spending time with one's own thoughts.The internet encourages us to direct our thoughts and questions outward: look things up; find out what others have said; go to wikipedia; etc. This is, I think, horribly corrosive to the very essence of being a thinking, sentient being.

Mutating parameters at a high-level for something that already works is more likely to result in something else that works than mutating parameters at a low level.So I believe LLMs benefit from high abstractions, like us.We just need good ones; and good ones for us might not be the same as good ones for LLMs.",

I have been using coding agent for over 7 months now and have written zero lines of code, in fact I don't know how to code at all. But i have been able to architect very complex software projects from scratch. Text to speech , automated llm benchmarking systems for testing all possible llama.cpp sampling parameters and more, and now im building my own agentic framework from scratch. All of these things are possible and more without writing one line of code yourself. But it does require understanding how to use the technology well to get this done.",

One day when the well runs dry, you must be able to either pay the actual cost (barring grand technology breakthroughs), or switch back to non-LLM workflows.

If you are just writing a large volume of code over and over again to do the same sort of things, then LLMs probably could take your job. A lot of people have joined the industry over time, and it seems like the intelligence bar moved lower and lower over time, particularly for people churning out large volumes of boilerplate code. If you are doing relatively novel stuff, at least in the sense that your abstractions are novel and the shape of the abstraction set is different from the standard things that exist in tutorials etc online, then the LLM will probably not work well with your style.So some people are panicking and they are probably right, and some other people are rolling their eyes and they are probably right too. I think the real risk is that dumping out loads of boilerplate becomes so cheap and reliable that people who can actually fluently design coherent abstractions are no longer as needed. I am skeptical this will happen though, as there doesn’t seem to be a way around the problem of the giant indigestible hairball (I.e as you have more and more boilerplate it becomes harder to remain coherent).",

There was a lot of old utility code that was messy, unorganized, and frankly gross. I had Codex completely reorganize the code into a sensible folder structure and strip out any functions that weren’t being used anymore—something like 300-plus functions.

The goal was always to keep the machine running on its 5-minute cycle. It was about getting the dishes into racks, rinsing them, and having them ready and waiting for the previous cycle to end—so you could push them into the machine immediately—then getting them dried and put away after the cycle, making sure the quality was there and no spot was missed. If the machine stopped, the goal was to get another batch into it, putting everything else on hold. Keeping the machine running was the only way to prevent dishes from piling up, which would end with the towers falling over and breaking plates. This work requires moving lightning fast with dexterity.AI coding agents are analogous to the machine.

It's basically a tax-advantaged way to fund R&D - you get the loss deductions now while retaining upside optionality later. This is why the \"cash burn = value destruction\" framing misses the mark. For the right investor base, $10B in annual losses at OpenAI could be worth $2-3B in tax shields (depending on their bracket and how the structure works). That completely changes the return calculation.\nThe real question isn't \"can OpenAI justify its valuation\" but rather \"what's the blended tax rate of its investor base?\" If you're sitting on a pile of profitable cloud revenue like Microsoft, suddenly OpenAI's burn rate starts looking like a pretty efficient way to minimize your tax bill while getting a free option on the AI leader.

          "content": "I don't see a bubble, I see a rapidly growing business case.MS Office has about 345 million active users. Those are paying subscriptions. IMHO that's roughly the totally addressable market for OpenAI for non coding users. Coding users is another few 20-30 million.If OpenAI can convert double digit percentages of those onto 20$ and 50$ per month subscriptions by delivering good enough AI that works well, they should be raking in cash by the billions per month adding up to close to the projected 2030 cash burn per year. That would be just subscription revenue. There is also going to be API revenue. And those expensive models used for video and other media creation are going to be indispensable for media and advertising companies which is yet more revenue.The office market at 20$/month is worth about 82 billion per year in subscription revenue. Add maybe a few premium tiers to that at 50$/month and 100$/month and that 2030 130 billion per year in cash burn suddenly seems quite reasonable.I've been quite impressed with Codex in the last few months. I only pay 20$/month for that currently. If that goes up, I won't loose sleep over it as it is valuable enough to me. Most programmers I know are on some paid subscription to that, Anthropic's Claude, or similar. Quite a few spend quite a bit more than that. My Chat GPT Plus subscription feels like really good value to me currently.Agentic tooling for business users is currently severely lacking in capability. Most of the tools are crap. You can get models to generate text. But forget about getting them to format that text correctly in a word processor. I'm constantly fixing bullets, headings and what not in Google docs for my AI assisted writings. Gemini is close to ff-ing useless both with the text and the formatting.But I've seen enough technology demos of what is possible to know that this is mostly a UX and software development problem, not a model quality problem. It seems companies are holding back from fully integrating things mainly for liability reasons (I suspect). But unlocking AI value like that is where the money is. Something similarly useful as codex for business usage with full access to your mail, drive, spread sheets, slides, word processors, CRMs, and whatever other tools you use running in YOLO mode (which is how I use codex in a virtual machine currently, --yolo). That would replace a shit ton of manual drudgery for me. It would be valuable to me and lots of other users. Valuable as in \"please take my money\".Currently doing stuff like this is a very scary thing to do because it might make expensive/embarrassing mistakes. I do it for code because I can contain the risk to the vm. It actually seems to be pretty well behaved. The vm is just there to make me feel good. It could do all sorts of crazy shit. It mostly just does what I ask it to. Clearly the security model around this needs work and instrumentation. That's not a model training problem though.Something like this for business usage is going to be the next step in agent powered utility that people will pay for at MS office levels of numbers of users and revenue. Google and MS could do it technically but they have huge legal exposure via their existing SAAS contracts and they seem scared shitless of their own lawyers. OpenAI doing something aggressive in this space in the next year or so is what I'm expecting to happen.Anyway, the bubble predictors seem to be ignoring the revenue potential here. Could it go wrong for OpenAI? Sure. If somebody else shows up and takes most of the revenue. But I think we're past the point where that revenue is not looking very realistic. Five years is a long time for them to get to 130 billion per year in revenue. Chat GPT did not exist five years ago. OpenAI can mess this up by letting somebody else take most of that revenue. The question is who? Google, maybe but I'm underwhelmed so far. MS, seems to want to but unable to. Apple is flailing. Anthropic seems increasingly like an also ran.There is a hardware cost bubble though. I'm betting OpenAI will get a lot more bang for its buck in terms of hardware by 2030. It won't be NVidia taking most of that revenue. They'll have competition and enter a race to the bottom in terms of hardware cost. If OpenAI burning 130 billion per year, it will probably be getting a lot more compute for it than currently projected. IMHO that's a reasonable cost level given the total addressable market for them. They should be raking in hundreds of billions by then.",

In terms of competition, I don't think we've seen any groundbreaking new research or architecture since the introduction of inference time compute (\"thinking\") in late 2024/early 2025 circa GPT-o4.The majority of the cost/innovation now is training this 1-2 year old technology on increasingly large amounts of content, and developing more hardware capable of running these larger models at more scale. I think it's fair to say the majority of capital is now being dumped into hardware, whether that's HBM and research related to that, or increasingly powerful GPUs and TPUs.But these components are applicable to a lot of other places other than AI, and I think we'll probably stumble across some manufacturing techniques or physics discoveries that will have a positive impact on other industries.> that ends up in a race to the bottom competing on cost and efficiency of deliveringOne could say that the introduction of the personal computer became a \"race to the bottom.\" But it was only the start of the dot-com bubble era, a bubble that brought about a lot of beneficial market expansion.> models that have all reached the same asymptotic performance in the sense of intelligence, reasoning, etc.I definitely agree with the asymptotic performance. But I think the more exciting fact is that we can probably expect LLMs to get a LOT cheaper in the next few years as the current investments in hardware begin to pay off, and I think it's safe to assume that in 5-10 years, most entry-level laptops will be able to manage a local 30B sized model while still being capable of multitasking. As it gets cheaper, more applications for it become more practical.---Regarding OpenAI, I think it definitely stands in a somewhat precarious spot, since basically the majority of its valuation is justified by nothing less than expectations of future profit. Unlike Google, which was profitable before the introduction of Gemini, AI startups need to establish profitability still. I think although initial expectations were for B2C models for these AI companies, most of the ones that survive will do so by pivoting to a B2B structure.

Sanctions used to be targeted at people trying to blow up the rule of law, now they are being used at people trying to apply it in ways that are politically inconvenient to a superpower and its allies.This is why so many non-Western states call \"rules-based order\" a branding exercise: the same legal tool that hits warlords and cartel bosses is repurposed, with no structural checks, against judges whose decisions you dislike. And once you normalize that, you've handed every other great power a precedent: \"our courts, our sanctions list, our enemies.\" The short-term message is \"don't touch our friends\"; the long-term message is \"international law is just foreign policy with better stationery.\"",

Running `uv pip install dep-a` and then `... dep-b` isn't the same as `... dep-b` first and then `... dep-a`, or the same as `uv pip install dep-a dep-b` which coming from an environment that does proper dependency resolution and have workspaces, can be really confusing.This is more of a pip issue than uv though, and `uv pip` is still preferable in my mind, but seems Python package management will forever be a mess, not even the bandaid uv can fix things like these.",

Also, building the interpreter such that it would successfully run Rails wasn't trivial.  Not that hard, but enough that a convenience wrapper mattered.  So you had a whole generation of web devs coming up in an environment where the core language wasn't the first touchpoint, and there wasn't an assumption that you could (or should) rely on what you could apt-get install on the base OS.This is broadly an extremely good thing.But the critical thing that RVM did was that it broke the circular dependency at the core of the problem: it didn't itself depend on having a working ruby interpreter.  Prior to that you could observe a sort of sniffiness about tools for a language which weren't implemented in that language, but RVM solved enough of the pain that it barged straight past that.Then you had similar tools popping up in other languages - nvm and leiningen are the first that spring to mind, but I'd also throw (for instance) asdf into the mix here - where the executable that you call to set up your environment has a '#!/bin/bash' shebang line.Go has sidestepped most of this because of three things: 1) rigorous backwards compatibility; 2) the simplest possible installation onramp; 3) being timed with the above timeline so that having a pre-existing `go` binary provided by your OS is unlikely unless you install it yourself.  And none of those are true of Python.  The backwards compatibility breaks in this period are legendary, you almost always do have a pre-existing Python to confuse things, and installing a new python without breaking that pre-existing Python, which your OS itself depends on, is a risk.  Add to that the sniffiness I mentioned (which you can still see today on `uv` threads) and you've got a situation where Python is catching up to what other languages managed a decade ago.Again.",

The human eye is most sensitive to green light, so that channel effectively carries the majority of the luminance (brightness/detail) data.\nIn many advanced demosaicing algorithms, the pipeline actually reconstructs the green channel first to get a high-resolution luminance map, and then interpolates the red/blue signals—which act more like \"color difference\" layers—on top of it. We can get away with this because the human visual system is much more forgiving of low-resolution color data than it is of low-resolution brightness data. It’s the same psycho-visual principle that justifies 4:2:0 chroma subsampling in video compression.Also, for anyone interested in how deep the rabbit hole goes, looking at the source code for dcraw (or libraw) is a rite of passage.

Or rather, stripped down to the most fundamental level. Lots of ways to describe it.Generally we shoot “flat” (there are so many caveats to this but I don’t feel like getting bogged down in all of it. If you plan on getting down and dirty with colors and really grading, you generally shoot flat). The image that we handover to DIT/editing can be borderline grayscale in its appearance. The colors are so muted, the dynamic range is so wide, that you basically have a highly muted image. The reason for this is you then have the freedom to “push” the color and look and almost any direction, versus if you have a very saturated, high contrast image, you are more “locked” into that look. This matters more and more when you are using a compressed codec and not something with an incredibly high bitrate or raw codecs, which is a whole other world and I am also doing a bit of a disservice to by oversimplifying.Though this being HN it is incredibly likely I am telling few to no people anything new here lol",

In that case I think there’s a well defined concept of “unprocessed” as it is a physical object.For digital photo, you require at least a rescaling to turn it to grayscale as the author did. But even that, the values your monitor shows already is not linear. And I’m not sure pedagogically it should be started with that, as the authors mention later about the Bayer pattern. Shouldn’t “unprocessed” come with the color information? Because if you start from gray scale, the color information seems to be added from the processing itself (ie you’re not gradually adding only processing to your “unprocessed” photo).To be fair, representing “unprocessed” Bayer pattern is much harder as the color filter does not nicely maps to RGB. If I were to do it I might just map the sensor RGB to just RGB (with default color space sRGB) and make a footnote there.",

By that definition, even an image that came straight out of the camera can be \"fake\" if it's showing something other than what it's purported to (e.g. a real photo of police violence but with a label saying it's in a different country is a fake photo).What most people think when they say \"fake\", though, is a photo that has had filters applied, which makes zero sense.

My understanding is that gamma correction is effectively a optimization scheme during encoding to allocate bits in a perceptually uniform way across the dynamic range. But if you just have enough bits to work with and are not concerned with file sizes (and assuming all hardware could support these higher bit depths), then this shouldn't matter? IIRC unlike crts, LCDs don't have a power curve response in terms of the hardware anyway, and emulate the overall 2.2 trc via LUT. So you could certainly get monitors to accept linear input (assuming you manage to crank up the bit depth enough to the point where you're not losing perceptual fidelity), and just do everything in linear light.In fact if you just encoded the linear values as floats that would probably give you best of both worlds, since floating point is basically log-encoding where density of floats is lower at the higher end of the range.https://www.scantips.com/lights/gamma2.html (I don't agree with a lot of the claims there, but it has a nice calculator)",

So when editing a photo, you may apply some processing to different areas to nudge the colors closer to how you’d “see” them.Ditto for black and white photos.  Your visual perception has pretty high dynamic range.  Not least because your eyes move and your brain creates a representation that gives you the illusion of higher dynamic range than what your eyes can actually deliver.

Applying the same transfer function to all pixels corresponds pretty tightly to film & paper exposure in analog photography. So one reasonable followup question is: did we count manually over- or under-exposing an analog photo to be manipulation or “processing”? Like you can’t see an image without exposing it, so even though there are timing & brightness recommendations for any given film or paper, generally speaking it’s not considered manipulation to expose it until it’s visible. Sometimes if we pushed or pulled to change the way something looks such that you see things that weren’t visible to the naked eye, then we call it manipulation, but generally people aren’t accused of “photoshopping” something just by raising or lowering the brightness a little, right?When I started reading the article, my first thought was, ‘there’s no such thing as an unprocessed photo that you can see’. Sensor readings can’t be looked at without making choices about how to expose them, without choosing a mapping or transfer function. That’s not to mention that they come with physical response curves that the author went out of his way to sort-of remove. The first few dark images in there are a sort of unnatural way to view images, but in fact they are just as processed as the final image, they’re simply processed differently. You can’t avoid “processing” a digital image if you want to see it, right? Measuring light with sensors involves response curves, transcoding to an image format involves response curves, and displaying on monitor or paper involves response curves, so any image has been processed a bunch by the time we see it, right? Does that count as “processing”? Technically, I think exposure processing is always built-in, but that kinda means exposing an image is natural and not some type of manipulation that changes the image. Ultimately it depends on what we mean by “processing”.",

For example, you take a photo on a drab cloudy day, but then edit the white balance to make it seem like golden hour, or brighten a part to make it seems like a ray of light was hitting that spot. Adjusting the exposure, touching up slightly, that's all fine, depending on what you are trying to achieve of course.

Containers work, because they ultimately ground out in the same set of stable kernel ABI calls.(Which, now that I think of it, makes me wonder how exactly Windows containers work.

Devs hate middlemen who silently fuck up their software and leave upstream with the mess, users hate being restricted to whatever software was cool and current two years ago. If they use a rolling distro, they hate the constant brokenness that comes with it. Of the 1% of people who don't hate this situation 99% of those merely tolerate it, and the rest are Debian developers who are blinded by ideology and sunk costs.Good operating systems should:1. Allow users to obtain software from anywhere.2. Execute all programs that were written for previous versions reliably.3. Not insert themselves as middlemen into user/developer transactions.Judged from this perspective, Windows is a good OS. It doesn't nail all three all the time, but it gets the closest. Linux is a bad OS.The answers to your questions are:(1) It isn't backwards compatible for sophisticated GUI apps. Core APIs like the widget toolkits change their API all the time (GTK 1->2->3->4, Qt also does this). It's also not forwards compatible. Compiling the same program on a new release may yield binaries that don't run on an old release. Linux library authors don't consider this a problem, Microsoft/Apple/everyone else does. This is the origin of the glibc symbol versioning errors everyone experiences sometimes.(2) Maintaining a stable API/ABI is not fun and requires a capitalist who says \"keep app X working or else I'll fire you\". The capitalist Fights For The User. Linux is a socialist/collectivist project with nobody playing this role. Distros like Red Hat clone the software ecosystem into a private space that's semi-capitalist again, and do offer stable ABIs, but their releases are just ecosystem forks and the wider issue remains.(3) It hasn't change and it's still bad.(4) Docker: \"solves\" the problem on servers by shipping the entire userspace with every app, and being itself developed by a for-profit company. Only works because servers don't need any shared services from the computer beyond opening sockets and reading/writing files, so the kernel is good enough and the kernel does maintain a stable ABI. Docker obviously doesn't help the moment you move outside the server space and coordination requirements are larger.",

Then they need to diff the new UI state with the old state and do reconciliation. This works well enough for tiny examples, but it’s clunky at scale. And the code to do diffing and reconciliation is insanely complicated. Hello world in react is like 200kb of javascript or something like that. (Smaller gzipped, but the browser still needs to parse it all at startup). And all of that diffing is also pure overhead. It’s simply not needed.The solidjs / react model uses the compiler to figure out how variables changing results in changes to the rendered view tree. Those variables are wrapped up as “observed state”. As a result, you can just update those variables and exactly and only the parts of the UI that need to be changed will be redrawn. No overrendering. No diffing. No virtual Dom and no reconciliation. Hello world in solid or svelte is minuscule - 2kb or something.Unfortunately, swiftui has copied react. And not the superior approach of newer libraries.The rust “Leptos” library implements this same fine grained reactivity, but it’s still married to the web.

Until then we have to optimize with how agents work best and ephemeral context is a part of that (they weren’t RL’d/trained with memory abstractions so we shouldn’t use them at inference either). Constant rediscovery that is task specific has worked well for me, doesn’t suffer from context decay, though it does eat more tokens.Otherwise the ability to search back through history is a valuable simple git log/diff or (rip)grep/jq combo over the session directory.

But having to use a non-local/proprietary memory layer is not ideal.My own fully-local, minimalistic take on this problem of \"session continuation without compaction\" is to rely on the session JSONL files directly rather than create separate \"memory\" artifacts, and seamlessly index them to enable fast full-text search. This is the idea behind the \"aichat\" command-group + plugin I just added to my claude-code-tools [1] repo. You can quit your Claude-Code/Codex-CLI session S and type    aichat resume <id-of-session-S-you-just-quit>\n\nIt launches a TUI, offering a few ways to continue your work:- blind trim - clones the session, truncates large tool calls/results and older assistant messages, which can clear up as much as 50% of context depending of course on what's going on; this is a quick hack to continue your work a bit longer- smart trim - similar but uses headless agent to decide what to truncate- rollover: the one I use most frequently; it creates a new session S1 (which can optionally be a different CLI agent, allowing cross-agent work continuation), and injects back-pointers to the parent session JSONL file of S, the parent's parent , and so on (what I call session lineage) , into the first user message, and the user can then prompt the agent to use a sub-agent to extract arbitrary context from the ancestor sessions to continue the work.[1] https://github.com/pchalasani/claude-code-tools?tab=readme-o...",

We do that too.What we’re focused on is a different boundary: memory that isn’t owned by a specific agent or tool.Once you start switching between tools (Claude, Codex, Cursor, etc.), or running multiple agents in parallel, markdown stops being “the memory” and becomes a coordination mechanism you have to keep in sync manually. Context created in one place doesn’t naturally flow to another, and you end up re-establishing state rather than accumulating it.That’s why we're not thinking about this as \"improving Claude Code”. We’re interested in the layer above that: a shared, external memory that can be plugged into any other model and tools, that any agent can read from or write to, and that can be selectively shared with collaborators. Context created in Claude can be reused in Codex, Manus, Cursor, or other agents from collaborators - and vice versa.If one already built and is using one agent in one tool and is happy with markdown, they probably don’t need this.

Why would it be hard to share specific files with teammates or collaborators?Edit - I realize I could be more helpful if I actually shared how I manage project context:CLAUDE.md or Agents.md is not the only place to store context for agents in a project, you can just store docs at any layer of granularity you want. What's worked best for me is to:1. Have a standards doc(s) (you can point the agents to the same standards doc in their respective claude.md/agents.md)2. Before coding, have the agent create implementation plans that get stored in to tickets (markdown files) for each chunk of work that would take about a context window length (estimated).3. Work through the tickets and update them as completed. Easy to refer back to when needed.4. If you want you can ask the agent to contribute to an overall dev log as well, but this gets long fast. Is useful for agents to refer to the last 50 lines or so to immediately get up to speed on \"what just happened?\", but so could git history.5. Ultimately the code is going to be the real \"memory\" of the true state, so try to organize it in a way that's easy for agents to comb through (no 5000 lines files that agents have trouble trying to carefully jump around in to find what they need without eating up their entire context window immediately).",

      "abstract": "该帖子讨论了“一切皆代码”理念下用单一代码库管理公司的实践。核心争议在于这种模式的实际可行性与适用范围。有人认为这本质上仍是普通前后端项目，仅因公司规模极小（疑似单人公司）才显得可行，其经验价值有限。也有用户指出55个业务服务存在过度设计问题，应进行整合。\n\n支持者强调单一代码库能减少关联模块间的协作摩擦，实现原子化变更。但反对声音认为“一次变更全局生效”极易导致生产环境故障，特别是数据库模式变更时难以保证前后兼容性。讨论中还提到价格结构用JSON文件而非数据库等具体设计引发质疑，有用户预测这将导致“代码库噩梦”。此外，部分评论认为文章疑似AI生成，但认同其极端化基础设施即代码的思路具有启发性。\n\n整体而言，社区对单一代码库在复杂系统中的可靠性存在明显分歧，但普遍认同其在小规模或关联紧密场景中的简化优势。",

While more obvious with a db schema, it is true for any networked api.At some point, you will have many teams. And one of them _will not_ be able to validate and accept some upgrade. Maybe a regression causes something only they use to break. Now the entire org is held hostage by the version needs of one team. Yes, this happens at slightly larger orgs. I've seen it many times.And since you have to design your changes to be backwards compatible already, why not leverage a gradual roll out?Do you update your app lock-step when AWS updates something? Or when your email service provider expands their API? No, of course not.

Companies like this one (Kasava) can get away with it because, well, they likely don't have very many customers and it doesn't really matter. But when you're operating at a scale where you have international customers relying on your SaaS product 24/7, suddenly deploys having a few minutes of downtime matters.This isn't to say monorepo is bad, though, but they're clearly naive about some things;> No sync issues. No \"wait, which repo has the current pricing?\" No deploy coordination across three teams. Just one change, everywhere, instantly.It's literally impossible to deploy \"one change\" simultaneously, even with the simplest n-tier architecture. As you mention, a DB schema is a great example. You physically cannot change a database schema and application code at the exact same time. You either have to ensure backwards compatibility or accept that there will be an outage while old application code runs against a new database, or vice-versa. And the latter works exactly up until an incident where your automated DB migration fails due to unexpected data in production, breaking the deployed code and causing a panic as on-call engineers try to determine whether to fix the migration or roll back the application code to fix the site.To be a lot more cynical; this is clearly an AI-generated blog post by a fly-by-night OpenAI-wrapper company and I suspect they have few paying customers, if any, and they probably won't exist in 12 months. And when you have few paying customers, any engineering paradigm works, because it simply does not matter.",

Overall I think looking back on our journey I'd sign up for it again, but it's not a panacea.Here were the downsides we ran into- Getting buy in to do everything through the repo. We had our feature flags controlled via a yaml file in the repo as well, and pretty quickly people got mad at the time it took for us to update a feature flag (open MR -> merge MR -> have CI update feature flag in our envs), and optimizing that took quite a while. It then made branch invariants harder to reason about (everything in the production branch is what is in our live environments, but except for feature flags). So, we moved that out of the monorepo into an actual service.- CI time and complexity. When we started getting to around 20 services that deployed independently, GitLab started choking on the size of our CI configuration and we'd see a spinner for about 5 minutes before our pipeline even launched. Couple that with special snowflakes like the feature flag system I mentioned above, eventually it got to the point that only a few people knew exactly how rollouts edge cases worked. The juice was not worth the squeeze at that point (the juice being - \"the repo is the source of truth for everything\")- Test times. We ran some e2e UI tests with Cypress that required a lot of beefy instances, and for safety we'd run them every single time. Couple that with flakiness, and you'd have a lot of red pipelines when the goal was 100% green all the time.That being said, we got a ton of good stuff out of it too.

If you make a change where the frontend release that uses a new backend feature is released alongside the backend feature itself, you can get version drift issues unless everything happens in lock-step and you have strong regional isolation.

If in the decision making the idea of an offering is added in then it brings up the possibility of gauging trust and building trust so that future actions can capture more value until an optimal infinite policy is attained. So, for instance, I look at all my possible options and I choose one based on how much I trust the other party AND how much I want to increase that trust in the future. So I give them an offering, select an option that gives them a little more but at a cost to me, to prove that I am willing to increase trust. If they reciprocate then I loose nothing and the next offering can be bigger. If they don't then I gained knowledge and my next offering is smaller. Basically, this is like tit for tat but over time and intended to get to the optimal solution instead of the min max solution. Clearly I'm not a mathematician, but I bet this could be refined to exact equations and formalized so that exact offerings could be calculated.",

How forgiving people are and how tolerant they are to deception, abuse and immorality. I hate to say it but a lot of people are attracted to abusers. They keep going back to the same kinds of people who will abuse them over and over. These same people who tolerate abuse often seem to show disrespect and look down on good, honest people. I cannot overstate how powerful this effect is; and it seems to be getting worse over time! And these people keep coming up with narratives to gaslight themselves about their abusers \"they're not so bad\"... People will especially do this when their abuser has power over them (Stockholm Syndrome).Once you factor these two things, cheating is the clear winning strategy. By a mile... It's objectively a superior strategy. If we just follow game theory; it will take us somewhere really dark. Game theory isn't what's keeping the world civilized. Society literally all rests on people's irrational emotions and moral principles.The desire to do the right thing is completely irrational and is a net loss to the individual. If we continue with the current system and current assumptions, all moral individuals will be wiped out because they are at a HUGE disadvantage. To solve our social problems, we need to be more moral; we need to learn to judge ourselves and other people through the lens of morality and be very firm about it.",

Broad collaboration and institution building is always the only way out of the hole, although the hole can be very deep and collaboration can be very costly until you get out.You are right though, that for an individual living in a good collaborative system, often cheating is very effective, it's just that the system can only handle a certain amount of that behavior before it collapses.As is discussed in the first scene of Plato's The Republic (surprisingly entertaining to modern tastes), the best play tends to be \"to be unjust while seeming just\".

The professionals who succeed are those who understand what the AI is doing, validate the output rigorously, and maintain clear mental models of their system.This becomes especially important for code quality and technical debt.

I tell it to not deviate from the spec at all, and be as uncreative as possible.Since it sticks pretty close to the spec and since TLA+ is about modifying state, the code it generates is pretty ugly, but ugly-and-correct code beats beautiful code that's not verified.It's not perfect; something that naively adheres to a spec is rarely optimized, and I've had to go in and replace stuff with Tokio or Mio or optimize a loop because the resulting code is too slow to be useful, and sometimes the code is just too ugly for me to put up with so I need to rewrite it, but the amount of time to do that is generally considerably lower than if I were doing the translation myself entirely.The reason I started doing this: the stuff I've been experimenting with lately has been lock-free data structures, and I guess what I am doing is novel enough that Codex does not really appear to generate what I want; it will still use locks and lock files and when I complain it will do the traditional \"You're absolutely right\", and then proceed to do everything with locks anyway.In a sense, this is close to the ideal case that I actually wanted: I can focus on the high-level mathey logic while I let my metaphorical AI intern deal with the minutia of actually writing the code.  Not that I don't derive any enjoyment out of writing Rust or something, but the code is mostly an implementation detail to me.

Go, for example, requires explicit error handling, but the way errors are handled are usually plain and homogenous. Adding unit testing everywhere creates a phenomenal amount of test code that can become 3x the size of the source, and certain changes (like interface changes) can require updates to all tests, especially if mocking is used.Obviously with AI maybe those issues I have go away. But I really don’t like letting the AI modify tests without meticulously manually reviewing those changes, because in my experience the AI cares more about getting the tests passing than it does about ensuring semantic correctness. For as long as tests are manually maintained I will continue keeping them as few as necessary while maintaining what I view as an acceptable amount of coverage.",

An AI code review is not a substitute for a deterministic result in sub-100ms to guarantee consistency. The auto-formatter is set up as a post-tool use Claude hook.3. Side-effect free imports and construction. You should be able to load all the code files and construct an instance of every class in your app without a network connection spawning. This is harder than it sounds and without it you run into all sorts of trouble with the rest.3. Zero mocks and shared global state. By mocks, I mean mocking frameworks which override functions on existing types or global. These effectively are injecting lies into the type checker.Should put to tsgo which has dramatically lowered our type checking latency.

It's easier to do these via tool checks than trust skills files.

Others miss nuance like we have to work hard to prevent the AI from subverting the type checks, like by default it works around type errors by using getattr/cast/typeignore/Any everywhere.One item I'm hoping is AI coders get better at is using static analysis tools and verification tools. My experiments here have been lukewarm/bad, like adding an Alloy model checker for some parts of GFQL (GPU graph query language) took a lot of prodding and found no bugs, but straight up asking codex to do test amplification on our unit test suite based on our code and past bugs works great. Likewise, it's easy to make it port conformance tests from standards and help with making our docs executable to help prevent drift.A new area we are starting to look at is automatic bug patches based on production logs. This is practical for the areas we setup for vibe coding, which in turn are the areas we care about more and work most heavily on.

I'll ask it to do X, and then ask it to do Y, and then ask it to do Z, and it'll give you the most junior looking code ever. No real thought on abstractions, maybe you'll just get the logic split into different functions if you're lucky. But no big picture thinking, even if I prompt it well it'll then create bad abstractions that expose too much information.So eventually it gets to the point where I'm basically explaining to it what interfaces to abstract, what should be an implementation detail and what can be exposed to the wider system, what the method signatures should look like, etc.So I had a better experience when I just wrote the code myself at a very high level. I know what the big picture look of the software will be. What types I need, what interfaces I need, what different implementations of something I need. So I'll create them as stubs. The types will have no fields, the functions will have no body, and they'll just have simple comments explaining what they should do. Then I ask the LLM to write the implementation of the types and functions.And to be fair, this is the approach I have taken for a very long time now. But when a new more powerful model is released, I will try and get it to solve these types of day to day problems from just prompts alone and it still isn't there yet.It's one of the biggest issues with LLM first software development from what I've seen. LLMs will happily just build upon bad foundations and getting them to \"think\" about refactoring the code to add a new feature takes a lot of prompting effort that most people just don't have. So they will stack change upon change upon change and sure, it works. But the code becomes absolutely unmaintainable. LLM purists will argue that the code is fine because it's only going to be read by an LLM but I'm not convinced. Bad code definitely confuses the LLMs more.",

For context, pricing that volume on something like Sonnet 4.5 would come out to roughly $500M in API costs. They likely offset a chunk of that with open models, but for higher-quality outputs, they’re still paying meaningful amounts to Claude / OpenAI / Google.Hard to make those numbers work without a lot of capital or an exit.",

It is addictive by design, it worsens mental health especially for kids, and it rewards outrage and misinformation. In that way, social media looks a lot like smoking. It was widely adopted before we understood the risks, then aggressively pushed because it was profitable.Meta did more than just take part in this system. It perfected it, scaled it worldwide, and resisted meaningful change until public pressure or regulation forced its hand.That is why it is worrying to see Meta present itself as a trusted builder of the next major technology wave. When a company repeatedly puts growth ahead of social harm, skepticism is not bias. It is common sense. Giving that company even more powerful and less transparent tools should cause us alarm.",

But the Manus story is about as stereotypical as it gets.",

It was mostly an exercise to experiment with Rust and SQLite (HN's two favorite topics). If you don't build a FTS5 index and import without WAL (--unsafe-mode), import of every reddit comment and submission takes a bit over 24 hours and produces a ~10TB DB.SQLite offers a lot of cool json features that would let you store the raw json and operate on that, but I eschewed them in favor of parsing only once at load time. THat also lets me normalize the data a bit.I find that building the DB is pretty \"fast\", but queries run much faster if I immediately vacuum the DB after building it.

          "content": "Our studio, LucasFonts, designed Calibri. Here are our CEO Luc(as) de Groot’s thoughts on the matter:Back to bad...Deciding to ditch Calibri as a ‘wasteful diversity’ font is both hilarious and sad. I designed Calibri to make reading on modern computer screens easier, and in 2006 Microsoft chose it to replace Times New Roman as the default font in the Office suite. Microsoft moved away from Times for good reasons. Calibri performs exceptionally well at small sizes and on standard office monitors, whereas serif fonts like Times New Roman create more visual disturbance. Although serif fonts work well on high-resolution displays, such as those found on modern smartphones, the serifs can introduce unnecessary visual noise on typical office screens and be particularly problematic for users with impaired vision, such as older adults.Professional typography can be achieved with serif or sans serif fonts. However, that is not very easy with Times New Roman, a typeface older than the current president. Originally crafted in Great Britain for newspaper printing, Times was optimised for paper, with each letterform meticulously cut and tested for specific sizes. In the digital era, larger-size drawings were repurposed as models, resulting in a typeface that appears too thin and sharp when printed at a high quality.Depending on the situation, fonts with serifs are often considered more classic, but they take more work to get right. While a skilled typographer can produce excellent results with Times New Roman, using the digital default version is not considered professional practice. This font only offers two weights, Regular and Bold, and the Bold version has a very different design that does not fit well. There are many better serif typefaces available. The digital version of Times New Roman, developed in the early days of computing, includes only minimal adjustments to letter pairs. This is particularly noticeable in all-capital words such as ‘CHICAGO’, where the spacing is inconsistent: the letters ‘HIC’ are tightly packed, while ‘CAG’ are spaced too far apart. By contrast, Calibri incorporates extensive spacing adjustments and language-specific refinements.This decision takes the administration back to the past and back to bad.(Microsoft could not rectify spacing issues in Times New Roman without altering the appearance of existing documents.)",

I personally think Times isn't a great choice for the reasons articulated in that statement (something open and more legible seems better to me), but I don't think it's a horrible choice either (it's standard and efficient with space). If the State Department wants to use a certain font, it's their prerogative.What bothers me about the decision is their rationale. If they had just switched without any explanation, it would have seemed more judicious and politic, befitting a department of state. Even better would be to announce a thoughtful font choice with reasoning based on the font itself, without defaulting to some thoughtless option \"because that's the way it was done in the past\", and moving away from the existing choice \"because DEI\". As it is, in my opinion, they made themselves look like idiots by obsessing over fonts from the perspective of something like DEI, as if they are paranoid over any possible subatom of DEI infecting their presence. Rubio couldn't just make it about the font, so to speak, he had to get hung up on irrelevant details which makes him (in my opinion) look worse than anything he might be criticizing.If you read the original announcement, my impression was that the choice of Calibri was because it it made state department functions easier as Calibri was the default in commonly used software (which seems kind of a poor reason to me, but one I can respect on practicality grounds). Legibility was also a concern (as it should be in my opinion). So something functional about Calibri (legibility) becomes \"DEI\" which is almost like cooties for this administration. Even if you disagree about the legibility of Calibri, denouncing legibility as a criterion per se seems absurd to me.The whole decision seems like a joke to me and a lost opportunity to set a decent design standard.",

          "content": "As indicated in the article, serifs come from how original letters were carved into stones: they were an artifact of the tool in use.Calligraphy developed similar traits by virtue of using a tool that produced an oval shape, and that you had to take care not to leave marks when pen/feather leaves the paper.With the printing press, when we became able to put many books out, we did start also doing some research about what makes a book easy to read.  Not least of because we could now easily put many characters on a single line and print it in the thousands.Serif or cursive fonts were the default \"content\" type, and sans-serif was reserved for titles, shop names and other \"short texts\" as a more \"modern\", cleaner look: serifs do indeed allow one to more easily track a single long line of text, as you can more clearly see the \"baseline\" and not accidentally skip into the line above or below.The next challenge is switching to the next line once you are done with the one you are on: while serifs help there too, the more important thing is the line length.  Thus the famous (is it? :) 60-70 word limit for a line, and why you also see many web pages that only take like 20% of our modern 32\"+ screens when browsers are made full screen.Now, columnar layout as popularized by newspapers does not really come from the same desire: like TMR, it actually comes from the desire to fit more on one page to save on costs.  With a wider column of text, all the last lines of paragraphs would average out at being half-empty, which is quite a bit with a wide column.Sure, low resolution screens made sans-serif inevitable even for documents, but compare that with the earliest segmented LCD screens: font was what you could get rendered with as little electronics as possible :)But today, serif fonts on high resolution screens (though there are still 32\" Full HD screens which are not really high-resolution), or with the use of subpixel rendering (antialiasing is no match, as you can see by connecting a modern Mac to a non-high res screen) are a great choice if you want to limit the space you use and maintain great readability.However, sans-serif fonts can work as well, and you may only need to go with a larger line spacing or shorter lines.  The trick is to aim for a number of words/letters, and not \"pixels\", though modern CSS treats them as a scalable unit.(Sorry for all of this being a bit rambly, just wanted to share a bit of the history along with how we can best apply it today)",

      "abstract": "该讨论围绕Steam平台下架游戏列表展开，核心话题是探究游戏被下架的原因及其对玩家的影响。社区普遍认同，游戏下架主要源于授权到期或开发商关闭，如《Deus Ex: Human Revolution》原版因升级导演剪辑版而停售。有人认为下架导致优秀作品无法合法获取，例如《Prey (2006)》因版权问题自2009年起无法购买。也有用户指出，部分成人内容游戏因支付处理器压力或违反平台条款被移除，但列表可能不完整，有独立开发者表示自己下架的游戏未收录其中。讨论中提到玩家关注下架是否影响已购游戏的使用，多数情况仅禁止新购买，但存在例外。此外，用户对下架游戏存档和社区展示功能表示兴趣，并分享了相关追踪群组。分歧点在于下架具体原因和列表的全面性，部分用户认为授权问题是主因，另一些则强调内容审查或商业策略的影响。",

The game is fully playable offline (and online with a patch) but cannot legally be sold because of an arbitrary restriction limiting the use of likeness of virtual cars in the game.[1] https://delistedgames.com/blur/",

So it's not available for purchase anymore. It got ~75% on reviews on release but i like the board game and it was true to the board game so i personally loved it. Link on the steam store (the site should have these) https://store.steampowered.com/app/242570/Space_Hulk/Fwiw if you have one of these games they are still in your Steam library. I still get to play the above game. I just can't easily play with others anymore nor can i suggest they purchase that game. I'm a little surprised it still runs fine given no updates but yay for backwards compatibility.In general a theme for lists like these are licensing. If a developer has to pay a franchise licensing fee it's going to stop being worthwhile at some point. Take note if you're a developer. It's hard to get visibility without being tied to a franchise (Eg. Larian had to do it with Baldurs Gate 3) but it'll cut into profits massively. Even Larian are never doing it again.",

          "content": "Projects like this and Docker make me seriously wonder where software engineering is going. Don't get me wrong, I don't mean to criticize Docker or Toro in parcicular. It's the increasing dependency on such approaches that bothers me.Docker was conceived to solve the problem of things \"working on my machine\", and not anywhere else. This was generally caused by the differences in the configuration and versions of dependencies. Its approach was simple: bundle both of these together with the application in unified images, and deploy these images as atomic units.Somewhere along the lines however, the problem has mutated into \"works on my container host\". How is that possible? Turns out that with larger modular applications, the configuration and dependencies naturally demand separation. This results in them moving up a layer, in this case creating a network of inter-dependent containers that you now have to put together for the whole thing to start...  and we're back to square one, with way more bloat in between.Now hardware virtualization. I like how AArch64 generalizes this: there are 4 levels of privilege baked into the architecture. Each has control over the lower and can call up the one immediately above to request a service. Simple. Let's narrow our focus to the lowest three: EL0 (classically the user space), EL1 (the kernel), EL2 (the hypervisor). EL0, in most operating systems, isn't capable of doing much on its own; its sole purpose is to do raw computation and request I/O from EL1. EL1, on the other hand, has the powers to directly talk to the hardware.Everyone is happy, until the complexity of EL1 grows out of control and becomes a huge attack surface, difficult to secure and easy to exploit from EL0. Not good. The naive solution? Go a level above, and create a layer that will constrain EL1, or actually, run multiple, per-application EL1s, and punch some holes through for them to still be able to do the job—create a hypervisor. But then, as those vaguely defined \"holes\", also called system calls and hyper calls, grow, won't so the attack surface?Or in other words, with the user space shifting to EL1, will our hypervisor become the operating system, just like docker-compose became a dynamic linker?",

They grow from tools like chroot, BSD jails, and Solaris Zones. Containers allow to deploy dependencies that cannot be simultaneously installed on a traditional Unix host system. it's not a UNIX architecture limitation but rather a result of POSIX + tradition; e.g. Nix also solves this, but differently.Containers (like chroot and jail before them) also help ensure that a running service does not depend on the parts of the filesystem it wasn't given access to. Additionally, containers can limit network access, and process tree access.These limitations are not a proper security boundary, but definitely a dependency boundary, helping avoid spaghetti-style dependencies, and surprises like \"we never realized that our ${X} depends on ${Y}\".Then, there's the Fundamental Theorem of Software Engineering [1], which states:  \"We can solve any problem by introducing an extra level of indirection.\" So yes, expect the number of levels of indirection to grow everywhere in the stack. A wise engineer can expect to merge or remove a some levels here and there, when the need for them is gone, but they would never expect that new levels of indirection should stop emerging.[1]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fundamental_theorem_of_softwar...",

          "content": "At a practical level I think a thesis that \"good\" process isolation systems (aka, not hosted on Linux) build on years of development that unikernels will struggle to replace holds true.At a conceptual level I really disagree with this piece, though:> one cannot play up Linux kernel vulnerabilities as a silent menace while simultaneously dismissing hypervisor vulnerabilities as imaginary.One can reasonably recognize Linux kernel vulnerabilities as extant and pervasive while acknowledging that hypervisors can be vulnerable. One can also realize that the surface area exposed by Linux is fundamentally much larger than that exposed by most hypervisors, and that the Linux `unshare` mechanism is insecure by default. It's kind of funny - the invocation of Linux really undermines this argument; there's no _reason_ a process / container isolation based system should be completely broken, but Linux _is_, and so it becomes a very weak opponent.I really don't think I can agree with the debugging argument here at a conceptual level, either. Issues with debugging unikernels are caused by poor outside-in tooling, but with good outside-in tooling, a unikernel should be _easier_ to debug than a container or OS process, because the VM-owner / hypervisor will often already have a way to inspect the unikernel-machine's entire state from the outside, without additional struggle of trying to maintain, juggle, and restore multiple contexts within a running system. There is essentially an ISP/ICE debugging probe attached to the entire system end to end by default, in the form of the hypervisor.For example, there is no reason a hosting hypervisor could not provide DTrace in a way which is completely transparent to the unikernel guest, and this would be much easier to implement than DTrace self-hosted in a running kernel!If done properly, this way a uni-application basically becomes debugging-agnostic: it doesn't need cooperative tracepoints or self-modifying patches (and all of the state juggling that comes with that, think like Kprobe), because the hypervisor can do the tracing externally.

But in reality probably always in an incomplete or odd way, and now you're using someone's hand crafted set of compatibility libraries instead of a battle tested operating system.I just think we haven't seen the right system, yet, which would probably be some specific application development mostly from the ground up in the context of unikernel, not the other way around.

In that case, what difference does it make if your application makes I/O requests through paravirtualized interfaces of the hypervisor or talks directly to the host via system calls? Both ultimately lead to the host OS servicing the request. There isn't any notable difference between the kernel/hypervisor and the user/kernel boundary in modern processors either; most of the time, privilege escalations come from errors in the software running in the privileged modes of the processor.Technically, in the former case, besides exploiting the application, a hypothetical attacker will also have to exploit a flaw in QEMU to start processes or gain further privileges on the host, but that's just due to a layer of indirection. You can accomplish this without resorting to hardware virtualization. Once in QEMU, the entire assortment of your host's system calls and services is exposed, just as if you ran your code as a regular user space process.This is the level you want to block exec() and other functionality your application doesn't need at, so that neither QEMU nor your code ran directly can perform anything out of their scope.

It felt efficient, after all you only replace a i < len check with buf[i] != null inside your loop right?But of course it doesn't actually work that way, copying one byte at a time is inefficient so instead we copy as many as possible at once, which is easy to do with just a length check but not so easy if you need to find the null byte.

      "abstract": "该讨论围绕“当用户表达对产品的不满时如何应对”展开。核心话题是如何处理负面反馈，尤其是当反馈带有敌意时。有人认为，表达强烈不满的用户可能是潜在的支持者，只要积极回应并展现改进意愿，他们可能转化为产品倡导者。也有用户指出，应避免在公开场合与敌对用户争辩，让无意义的讨论自然消退。\n\n讨论中提到，部分用户批评某些公司的傲慢态度，例如CEO在道歉时仍指责用户言辞过激，这被视作缺乏诚意。分歧点在于对“仇恨者”的定义：有人认为真正的“仇恨者”会执着地挑刺并公开抨击，而普通用户的不满只是出于挫折感。此外，对于反馈处理方式，有用户强调应避免直接否定用户需求，即使无法满足也要给予尊重回应。\n\n共识在于，接受批评是困难但必要的，成熟的做法是冷静分析反馈价值。然而，在具体应对策略上，社区存在不同立场，部分人主张积极互动，另一部分则建议保持距离以避免事态升级。",

Usually, it's because they've managed to avoid an open market all-together, (e.g. through exploiting intelectual property protection, byzantine compliance requirements, exclusive contracts made without concern for end users, etc…) and there's no need to make the product good, making it far worse than all of the competition (combined).",

The wheels not squeaking aren't getting regular maintenance or care. No one is incentivized to ask nicely but people are strongly being incentivized to scream.

For C++, they’ll include detailed type information for every instantiation of every type everywhere in your program, including the types of every field (recursively), method signatures, etc. etc., along with the types and locations of local variables in every method (updated on every spill and move), line number data, etc. etc. for every specialization of every function. This produces a lot of data even for “moderate”-sized projects.Worse: for C++, you don’t win much through dynamic linking because dynamically linking C++ libraries sucks so hard. Templates defined in header files can’t easily be put in shared libraries; ABI variations mean that dynamic libraries generally have to be updated in sync; and duplication across modules is bound to happen (thanks to inlined functions and templates). A single “stuck” or outdated .so might completely break a deployment too, which is a much worse situation than deploying a single binary (either you get a new version or an old one, not a broken service).",

You might expect that the compiler would just leave out some initialization code and compile the remaining code in the expected way, causing the values to be “whatever was in memory previously”.  But no - the compiler can (and absolutely will) optimize by assuming the values are whatever would be most convenient for optimization reasons, even if it would be vanishingly unlikely or  even impossible.As an example, consider this code (godbolt: https://godbolt.org/z/TrMrYTKG9):    struct foo {\n        unsigned char a, b;\n    };\n\n    foo make(int x) {\n        foo result;\n        if (x) {\n            result.a = 13;\n        } else {\n            result.b = 37;\n        }\n        return result;\n    }\n\nAt high enough optimization levels, the function compiles to “mov eax, 9485; ret”, which sets both a=13 and b=37 without testing the condition at all - as if both branches of the test were executed. This is perfectly reasonable because the lack of initialization means the values could already have been set that way (even if unlikely), so the compiler just goes ahead and sets them that way.

We’ve become so accustomed to \"scaling by throwing more RAM and nodes at the problem\" that we've almost forgotten the sheer efficiency of a well-tuned OS.Seeing a global service run on a 512MB FreeBSD VPS using Jails is a masterclass in software craftsmanship. It’s a stark reminder that our modern \"cloud-native\" stack often masks inefficiency with complexity. It makes me rethink the infrastructure I build—do we really need a massive cluster for every service, or do we just need to understand our operating system better?The choice of FreeBSD here isn't just \"niche\"; it’s a pragmatic engineering decision that prioritizes stability and resource predictability. Truly inspiring work.",

The simplicity of 21 MB is mind boggling to me. Makes one really wonder what bloat really is I suppose, definitely a fun experience.Oh also I love alpine because I ran it in my phone using UserLand and I loved it although running python in alpine was a bit of mess on my phone and I think I ended up doing some wizard magic or something using g-compat in the end as well to run it.

It’s only when you’re trying to design fancier protocols on top of Curve25519 or Edwards25519 that you can run into subgroup issues.And for those use cases, I personally try my best to just reproject everything back into the prime order subgroup whenever possible.  Monocypher has a number of such fancy functions:  crypto_x25519_dirty_fast()\n  crypto_x25519_dirty_small()\n  crypto_elligator_map()\n  crypto_elligator_rev()\n  crypto_elligator_key_pair()\n\nThe dirty functions explicitly produce public keys that cover the entire curve, so that random such keys are truly indistinguishable from random when converted with `crypto_elligator_rev()`.  But instead of just removing the clamp operation, I instead add random low-order point, so that when we later use the point in an X25519 key exchange, the shared secret is exactly the same as it would have been for a genuine X255119 key.That’s where I thank DJB for designing a key exchange protocol that project the shared secret to the prime order subgroup, even when the public key it processes is not.  The original intent may have been to make checks easier (low order keys all end up yielding zero), but a nice side effect is how it enabled a nice API for Mike Hamburg’s Elligator2.> Accepting points outside the prime-order subgroup can quietly undermine higher-level assumptions, even if no immediate exploit is obvious.If on the other hand we can prove that all computed results are low-order-component-independent (as is the case for X25519), then we know for sure we’re safe.  In the end, Ristretto is only really needed when we can’t tweak the protocol to safely reproject to the prime order subgroup.Don’t get me wrong, having a prime order group abstraction does help.  But if someone is qualified to design a protocol that may require this, they’re qualified to try and make it work with a non-trivial cofactor as well — that, or prove it cannot be done.",

That might be true.\nBut ironically, the practice of \"building from scratch\" is the best antidote to AI dependency.Writing from Japan, we call this process \"Shugyo\" (austere training).\nA master carpenter spends years learning to sharpen tools, not because it's efficient, but to understand the nature of the steel.Building your own Redis or Git isn't about the result (which AI can give you instantly). It is about the friction. That friction builds a mental model that no LLM can simulate.Whether this post is marketing or not, the \"Shugyo\" itself is valid.",

Not that the games of the era stand up to modern stuff, even when upscaled and texture-packed etc. in an emulator, but how they did it with so little oomph still amazes me.",

There were several check moments and data validation after that, but sales numbers remained as they were.The conclusion was that affiliate marketing claimed a lot of sales in their reporting, but the brand was strong enough (this company was #2 by market share in the country and #1 on most brand metrics) to get those customers without affiliate links.",

While it's fine to feel guilty for your involvement in the scheme don't let that get in the way of placing the blame for it squarely on the people who set things up this way and put you in this position.When you can't escape an evil system you just have to do your best within it, while either working to get out of it or working to improve it however you can.

Capitalism is pretty much inescapable, but thankfully I'm not convinced that capitalism is an evil system inherently, it just needs strong constraints and regulations to keep it from being used to do evil things.",

I was once recruited to work on a software installer which could build and sign dynamic collections of software which was meant to be used to conveniently install several packages at once. Like, here's a set of handy tools for X task, here are the default apps we install on machines for QA people, here is our suite of apps for whatever. It seemed to have genuine utility because it could pull data in real time to ensure it was all patched and current and so on. That could be great for getting new machines up and running quickly. Several options exist for this use case today, but didn't then as far as I recall. This was on Windows.Ultimately it was only used to install malware in the form of browser extensions, typically disguised as an installer for some useful piece of software like Adobe Acrobat. It would guide you through installing some 500 year old version of Acrobat and sneakily unload the rest of the garbage for which we would be paid, I don't know, 25 cents to a couple dollars per install. Sneaking Chrome onto people's machines was great money for a while. At one point we were running numbers of around $150k CAD per day just dumping trash into unsuspecting people's computers.At no point in the development of that technology were we told it was going to ruin countless thousands of people's browsers or internet experiences in general. For quite a while the CEO played a game with me where I'd find bad actors on the network and report them to him. He'd thank me and assure me they were on top of figuring out who was behind it. Eventually I figured out that the accounts were in fact his. They let me go shortly after that with generous severance.I don't miss anything about ad tech. It was such a disheartening introduction to the software world. It's really the armpit and asshole of tech, all at once.",

There's an 1853 travelogue piece embedded here of an author visiting the factory, where he notes in the worst parts of the factory where boiling and heat are applied, it was staffed with boys who barely made more than a dollar a week. By boys I thought it was slang for young men then I realized 1850s England was heavily using child labor.Those cables are the product of child labor, like much of the Victorian age's industrial and textile output. Children often made up significant portions of factory workforces, sometimes 25-50% in certain textile sectors, with many under 14. I wish the stories of child labor were better told and more prominent.
