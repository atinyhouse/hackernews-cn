      "abstract": "Discord宣布下月起将要求用户通过人脸扫描或身份证验证来获取完整访问权限，声称此举旨在保护青少年安全。社区讨论围绕隐私风险、平台动机和替代方案展开激烈辩论。\n\n核心争议集中在隐私保护与年龄验证的必要性。许多用户强烈质疑Discord的数据安全能力，有人指出2025年10月的数据泄露事件已导致7万用户身份证照片外泄，这与平台“立即删除ID信息”的承诺相矛盾。也有用户认为真实动机是Discord为IPO做准备，通过严格验证提升投资者信心。讨论中提到，这种强制身份验证可能开启危险先例，未来或演变为所有在线服务都需要扫描证件的常态。\n\n在解决方案方面存在明显分歧。有人认为哈希链技术能在不泄露隐私的前提下验证年龄，批评Discord选择身份证和人脸扫描是别有用心。同时，不少用户呼吁立即取消Nitro订阅作为抗议手段。共识在于普遍对集中式身份数据库感到担忧，认为少数科技公司掌握大量生物识别数据存在巨大风险。\n\n关于替代方案，社区积极讨论开源替代品，包括Matrix、Stoat、IRC+Mumble组合及Signal等选项。有用户提出关键问题：当依赖的唯一平台变得不可接受时，如何迁移多个社区关系？这反映出用户对平台锁定的深层焦虑。整体而言，社区对Discord新政策持高度怀疑态度，普遍认为其牺牲用户隐私换取商业利益。",

But I think this is a reasonable place for me to post some thoughts.Given current events in the USA, I can't emphasize enough how worried one should be about the fact that a few companies like Discord, Google (Gmail), and Meta have databases with access to the private conversations of hundreds of millions of people with their closest friends and family members, linked up with their identity.Some of the big strengths of running a self-hosted Zulip server for your community are:- Zulip servers are operationally simple, highly stable and easy to upgrade.- Zulip is much better than Discord or Slack for managing the firehose of busy communities. Or at least, a lot of people tell us that they prefer the user experience to everything else they've tried, after a few weeks of getting used to it. :)- Your community leaders get to make the policy decisions about data protection, identity, etc.- It's 100% FOSS software, with an extremely readable and maintainable codebase that ~1500 people have successfully contributed code to. I don't think you'll find modern alternatives with a comparable featureset to Discord that are more resilient to the sponsoring company being acquired or going out of business.- We are a values-focused organization (https://zulip.com/values/) where providing a public service is important to us all.- Each server is completely self-contained and independent, with the only centralized services needed from us being desktop/mobile app publication and mobile push notifications delivery (which is free for community use and soon to be E2EE).I'm happy to answer any questions.",

          "content": "> There was an appeal button; she was asked to take a picture of her face from many angles and upload ID. She gave them everything they asked for, but when Facebook reviewed the appeal, they closed her account permanently.I can't speak for every company, but I know with Facebook and Paypal, these requests generally are from automated systems and the chances of successfully reopening the account is well under 1%. The info you submit is not viewed by a human and the systems are mostly treated as a way to lighten the load on human support staff. They don't care if your account is reopened, they just want you to feel like you had a chance, did all you could, and then just give up.I discovered this about 20 years ago dealing with Paypal. I happened to know someone who worked in Paypal engineering at the time. I had a well established account, a Paypal debit card, linked accounts, etc., everything you could need to feel good about an account.Out of the blue it was suspended and I was sent into this system to send in verification documents. I gave everything it wanted. First it was ID, then a \"utility bill\" so I sent over my phone bill. That wasn't acceptable because it didn't prove I lived at my address for some reason, so I sent a natural gas bill. Even though that did have to be tied to a physical address (you can't deliver gas wirelessly!) I was asked for an electric bill. Then the lease. Then a bank statement. Every time I gave it pretty quickly. Then I was asked for a passport. I didn't have one. Suddenly that was the only thing that could unlock my account and as soon as they had the passport my account would be reopened. Nothing further would be done without a passport, not even communication.I asked my friend to look into it. She said, \"that's on purpose, that's the NoBot. It gets people out of support's hair.\" Turns out if you let unhappy customers complain to humans on the phone they will, so some exec decided to improve call center metrics by forcing customers into a system designed to keep them occupied until they gave up. You funneled people into it, and it would continue to reject their submissions with new reasons infinitely. It just went through a list of things to ask for, and when it found one you couldn't provide, suddenly that was the key and without it you were screwed.Companies still do this today.",

I mean, it's just a matter of fact that everyone requires them, and it also has that weird status of \"semi-secret thing\" that you are somehow aren't supposed to give to anyone, and I still have close to zero understanding of how that works.So, I suppose you shouldn't give your fake id (digital or physical) to a government officials. It also seems \"obvious\" that it's similarly unwise to give it to a bank. But you can do that to a random guy on AirBnB? A hotel? To a delivery service (Uber/Wolt/whatever)? Dicsord?

          "content": "Some of the big weaknesses of running a self-hosted Zulip server for your community are:- Your server admin can see DMs (or at least metadata, not sure if Zulip does E2E for DMs). The same is true for centralized services in theory, but unless you're a terrorist or a person of interest to a major government, it's extremely unlikely that a Discord employee will have an incentive to spy on your messages specifically. Your admin is likely part of your community and may know you personally, so the temptation is much, much higher.- If the admin dies and nobody else has the keys to the kingdom, the server can go down at any point, and there's no way for users to reconstitute the network semi-automatically. Discord servers don't just go away unless somebody actively makes them to.- It's much less secure in practice, it relies on your admin to always be on guard and constantly update their server to prevent vulnerabilities, either in Zulip or in the myriad of other self-hosted services running on it. One guy in his basement that goes on vacation once a year and has family responsibilities is far more likely to make mistakes than a team of trained cybersecurity professionals.- Many Discord users are in 20+ servers. Anything that doesn't provide a one-click server joining experience (for users who already have an account on a different server) is nowhere near a Discord replacement.- People want bots (for things like high-fidelity Youtube music streaming on voice channels), and those are mostly Discord-only.- Anything open source will be worse at phishing and fraud / abuse prevention by definition, as many fraud-prevention approaches rely on the fraudster blindly guessing at what the code and ML models (do you even have ML models for this) are doing.",

Simply because it’s way too easy to lose access to my money in the account with them.

For example, I could imagine offering a paid add-on for encrypted backups.That said, I'd like to push back on the idea that charging businesses for a tool that's an important part of their daily work \"breaks the seal\". Organizations with a software budget should be happier to pay a fair price for ethical, user-first software from a friendly vendor than for a closed-source product from a megacorp.

So if you want your self-hosted Zulip server to work with the Zulip client apps in the App Store and Play Store, you have to use Zulip's push server, and there's nothing Zulip can do to fix that.Matrix works analogously; if you use the Element app from the App Store or Play Store, then you're using Element's push notification server, even if your Matrix homeserver is self-hosted. It's possible that Element allows their server to be used gratis in situations where Zulip charges a fee, I don't know their policies or anything, but in principle Matrix still leaves you exactly as dependent on a third party's goodwill unless you make your friends install a privately distributed mobile app.Zulip IIUC does not restrict self-hosting of any feature that's technically possible to self-host.",

I learn much better working with real code and this was a great experience. It was certainly a different experience than it would have been without an LLM teacher, reviewer, helper, assistant. The app was beautifully designed and very cleanly implemented back in Java 1.4 days of 2004 so it has been a joy to modernize it while attempting to preserve the clean design.  The OpenGL work and the necessary math was a lot different than what I have been doing for most of my career so it was a lot of fun. I will probably continue tinkering with Tribal Trouble occasionally as I still enjoy playing the game. I want to learn Blender to edit/improve the 3D models. (https://github.com/bondolo/tribaltrouble)For now I have mostly moved on from gaming and am instead working on improving the accessibility (#a11y) of the Wireshark network protocol capture/analysis tool. There are a lot of blind and low vision IT folks for whom this tool is a job requirement. The current accessibility is unfortunately poor. I've submitted my first PR and am relearning the Wireshark source after last contributing 20 years ago. It's also been 15 years since the last time I did anything with Qt so that has been a refresher as well. I don't enjoy working in C++ but the goal matters so I will suffer through. (https://wireshark.org)I plan to work on Wireshark for a couple of months at least and then look for something else to contribute to, probably also accessibility related. I have some ideas already about next apps. I'm currently tempted to build an NFC app for iOS in Swift but haven't decided yet. After having built in the last year both Kotlin Compose and TypeScript React apps, none of which I enjoyed very much, I am somewhat curious if Swift and SwiftUI will be more fun.",

It started as me scratching my own itch, and now it’s turning into a real platform.Each game adds more building blocks to the editor: multiplayer, event systems, NPC behaviors, pathfinding, etc. I build a system once, and then anyone using the editor can use it in a click.\nFor game logic, I recently added a visual event system I’m really excited about. It’s kind of like Unreal Blueprints, but focused on 2D. You pick a trigger, wire conditions, and chain actions in a node graph [1].Big challenge right now: most people who want to make games needs assets, and don't know how to get/make them. So I’m building a marketplace where pixel artists can upload tilesets/characters, and unlike itch.io, assets are usable directly inside the engine. No ZIP downloads or import setup, just browse and drop into your game. A preview here[2].Also, if you want to use the editor but ship elsewhere, you can export terrain, animations, and hitboxes to Godot 4. Nothing is locked in.The engine/editor is at https://craftmygame.com if anyone wants to poke around! And you can test a games here[3][4], and 1 multiplayer game I've tested IRL in a bar [4]![1] https://youtu.be/8fRzC2czGJc[2] https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hScOK_naYnk[3] https://craftmygame.com/game/e310c6fcd8f4448f9dc67aac/r/play[4] https://www.youtube.com/shorts/WOIUmOVvaZM",

In the same week I was explaining another aspect and got the same response.  I think management has been overcomplicated by people trying to codify it. I think MBAs and systems like EOS try to dumb everyone down to inhuman lowest-common-denominator robots. That is the main cause of the productivity crisis.That's why people leave their jobs, and magically find they are 100% more productive without a boss. No BS, and they are inspired.I think you could get further faster by being a human, being inspiring, being a leader. I think you could learn more from Nelson than whatever nasty dehumanising theory most bosses have been reading.I'm struggling to find the motivation to write up my notes (neurodiversity both helping me see the problem and stopping me do anything about it).  I'm struggling to name  the theory. I am struggling ( with some limited success) in noticing what I do differently. I'm also struggling with recovering from a major burnout from succeeding creating highly motivated teams in really tough organisations.I thought all along that I would be better with a collaborator watching me and noting the differences between what I do and what everyone else is doing, then interviewing me about it.Maybe I could publish bits of it, little tidbits of blogs (who would find them?) or social media videos (I really don't want to have to record and edit videos).

So there must be a shortcut, some more powerful intermediate representation than just text (text is too general and powerful, and you can’t compute over it… until now with LLMs?)That graph felt a lot like code to me: there’s no unique representation of knowledge in a graph, but there are some that are much more useful than others; building a well-factored graph takes time and taste; graphs are composable and reusable in a way that feels like it could help you discover layers of abstraction in your arguments.",

As the language is similar to python, hopefully it is able to work well syntactically. But of course, the correctness and accuracy of the circuit would be more challenging to get right. Your work at https://www.mikeayles.com/#tokn is very cool! This will be very useful when I try LLMs!I have seen both atopile and tscircuit too and they are really complete it terms of the entire PCB design flow compared to circuitscript, which is just focused on the schematic part.The ato language works well for specifying parts and parameters, but is very basic for defining connectivity. This means that the designer will have minimal control of how the final schematics will turn out. Of course, atopile focuses on the complete design flow, so having nice schematics could be a want rather than a need. For myself, especially in my professional job, clear and well-organized schematics are important not just for understanding and creation, but also troubleshooting the design and eventually improving the design.I did try some automatic layout features for the schematic that balances giving the user some control over the overall schematic, but this was really hard to get right. In the end, I went with the logo/turtle approach and give full layout control to the user.For tscircuit, I like typescript as a programming language and circuitscript itself is created in typescript. But typescript is really clunky to use for schematic design. Coupled with react, there is a lot of extra noise/symbols when looking at the code and for complex designs, it will be challenging to understand and troubleshoot. Moreover, I believe that typescript/javascript is less common among electronics engineers compared to python (which circuitscript is based on). The simplicity of python is one of the reasons it is popular and that is what I believe might help to lower the learning curve for circuitscript.",

Bad architecture early on will cost you weeks later.Start with a tiny scope (like a single-screen platformer), use Claude Code to move fast on the code side, but spend most of your energy on the parts AI can't help with — design and feel.Also, shameless plug,  if you want to skip the code entirely and just focus on making the game, that's what CraftMyGame is for.

Hopefully this might help others the way it did for our family. The app is built using flutter because im going to release it on Android too very soon, and I couldnt be bothered creating it twice. Initially the idea was more of a game-like-app, and then it made sense to use flutter. Now though, its not really game-like and couldve just as well been native (apart for me not bothering doing it twice). If i wouldve done it again from scratch, for this app, i would still have chosen flutter.",

Changing the schema to something else and back worked.- Limiting the free version on number of tabs feels... annoying. I appreciate that a lot of stuff out there doesn't even have a free version but the software automatically opened with a few tabs (or I accidentally clicked on it?) and then as soon as I clicked on my first table I was paywalled. I feel like I'll accidentally open more tabs (even though I really just wanna work on one at a time) and get frustrated, which is more likely to drive me away than to pay at this point.Note btw that ofc you have to make money and this is a product that I feel I'd be willing to pay for but I got frustrated within 2mins of using it so it wasn't like oh I've felt the value let me pay, it was more like I haven't even gotten to value yet.Great work anyway and I'll keep trying and provide feedback as it comes!

In Spain, for example, to use Bizum, you need either an Android/iOS smartphone (and for the Android case, as you use it from your bank's app, it would typically require some Google security assurances - so no Huawei phones allowed, for example) or logging into your bank's website and use Bizum from there, only if your bank allows you to use Bizum via web. And it's not very practical or convenient to do that when you're in a store and want to pay, in contrast to swiping your credit card.So while I see very convenient gaining some sovereignty from American companies for these payments, I think we're losing it when we will need devices controlled by other American companies in order to use the new system.",

The same devices that accept UPI (usually some android based POS) also accepted a plethora of cards. Previously merchants would be hesitant to take anything other than cash or charge 2% for visa/mastercard. But with wide adoption of digital payments they now just accept any payment with the goal that they don't want bad reviews and/or lose customers.Point being that with a cheap alternative, it's actually much more convenient now to use a Visa or Mastercard especially with tap to pay because with competition being so high, the diversity means people allow all payments.",

There is a premium for that flexibility that gets reflected in processing fees.- For both consumers and merchants, fraud risk is real and while it's the most solvable part of all this it's a real (and costly!) factor today. That risk for fraud gets moved upstream to the networks/acquirers/processors/issuers and that premium shows up in (you guessed it) processing fees.If you want to switch the world to a debit-based system where economic transactions are limited by cash on hand, I'd argue that's a poorer and less dynamic world than the one we're operating in today.",

But the ease of payment processing, and the number of people who just won't buy it if they can't use a card, outweighs dealing with fraud I guess.",

Each EU country developed its own domestic payment solution — Bizum in Spain, iDEAL in the Netherlands, Payconiq in Belgium, Girocard in Germany — but none could work across borders. A Belgian consumer buying from a Dutch retailer still needed Visa or Mastercard. National pride and competing banking interests repeatedly sabotaged attempts at unification.> The network effect compounds the challenge. Merchants accept Visa and Mastercard because consumers carry them. Consumers carry them because merchants accept them. Breaking that loop requires either regulatory force or a critical mass of users large enough to make merchants care — which is precisely what the EuroPA deal attempts to deliver by connecting existing national user bases rather than building from scratch.",

Sure they have your banks local branding but it's Visa anyway.This also applies to payment terminal, most (not all) go through the Visa payment network to process payments.And even in the same country a lot of online payment either goes through credit cards (again mostly Visa in EU) or PayPal. This isn't technically needed at all but due to fragmentation whatever alternative you want to use is just sometimes available.Which is where Wero comes in:- try to reduce fragmentation by making it a cooperation across many banks (of which most had their own failed PayPal alternative)- onboard people on (local) online banking and private Phone2Phone payment (e.g. bill sharing)- then (now) expand to pushing some payment terminal providers to support it with Phone based payment. There are multiple initiatives for it.The later part is possible due to 3 reasons:- payment apps on phone bypassing secure module monopoly nonsense related to EC/Credit cards and visa- a lot of the in-person checkout systems of small businesses are now a tablet + separate cash register + EC terminal. This means that even if the EC terminal doesn't support Wero the payment system can still do so through their tablet.- Also I think some of the wider used payment terminal in large EU specific chains can get Wero support with a software update.Still it's by far not a perfect situation:- still too much fragmentation/to little adoption by banks- \"old\" payment terminals and (physical) checkout systems which are bound to Visa and can't easily be updatedSo there most likely won't be a hard break anytime soon, and your EC card will likely continue using Visa secure module and network for a very very long time.But having a technical working alternative which can slowly start eating market share is already a huge step forward.",

It was then renamed Visa in 1976.The answer is:  \"Banks.\"",

If we go back to Buckminster Fuller identifying the the \"Knowledge Doubling Curve\", by observing that until 1900, human knowledge doubled approximately every century. By the end of World War II, it was doubling every 25 years.  In his 1981 book \"Critical Path\", he used a conceptual metric he called the \"Knowledge Unit.\"  To make his calculations work, he set a baseline:- He designated the total sum of all human knowledge accumulated from the beginning of recorded history up to the year 1 CE as one \"unit.\"- He then tracked how long it took for the world to reach two units (which he estimated took about 1,500 years, until the Renaissance).Ray Kurzweil took Fuller’s doubling concept and applied it to computer processing power via \"The Law of Accelerating Returns\".  The definition of the singularity in this approach is the limit in time where human knowledge doubles instantly.Why do present day ideas of the singularity not take this approach and instead say \"the singularity is a hypothetical event in which technological growth accelerates beyond human control, producing unpredictable changes in human civilization.\" - Wikipedia",

However, lets say you give it a Terabyte of assembly code - it won't be able to produce correct output as it will run out of context.You can get around that with agentic frameworks, but all of those right now are manually coded.So how do you train an LLM to correctly take any length of assembly code and produce the correct result? The only way is to essentially train the structure of the neurons inside of it behave like a computer, but the problem is that you can't do back-propagation with discrete zero and 1 values unless you explicitly code in the architecture for a cpu inside. So obviously, error correction with inputs/outputs is not the way we get to intelligence.It may be that the answer is pretty much a stochastic search where you spin up x instances of trillion parameter nets and make them operate in environments with some form of genetic algorithm, until you get something that behaves like a Human, and any shortcutting to this is not really possible because of essentially chaotic effects.,",

Maybe you're older and have had enough conversations about the concept of a singularity that the topic is already boring to you.Let them have their fun. Related, some adults are watching The Matrix, a 26 year old movie, for the first time today.For some proof that it's not some common idea, I was recently listening to a fairly technical interview with a top AI researcher, presenting the idea of the singularity in a very indirect way, never actually mentioning the word, as if he was the one that thought of it. I wanted to scream \"Just say it!\" halfway through. The ability to do that, without being laughed at, proves it's not some tired idea, for others.",

      "abstract": "这篇HackerNews帖子讨论了一位资深程序员对编程行业变迁的感慨。核心话题围绕“编程乐趣的消逝”，作者从7岁开始编程，如今50岁，感到热爱的领域已面目全非。\n\n社区观点多元。许多同龄用户深有共鸣，认为自2010年代初以来，技术带来的兴奋感急剧衰退，如今行业过度关注指标而非实际产出，充满无意义的管理流程。也有用户指出，当前讨论实质是对AI冲击的忧虑，而非单纯怀旧——AI工具正改变编程的本质，使亲手解决问题的乐趣减少。\n\n分歧明显。部分年轻开发者反驳悲观论调，表示自己仍在编程中找到巨大乐趣，认为技术演进自然如铁匠到工厂的转变，应拥抱变化。同时，有用户质疑原文由AI生成，引发对讨论真实性的关注。共识在于，多数人认同编程的核心价值在于创造与解决问题的过程，但对其未来走向看法不一：有人坚信优秀开发者能借助AI保持优势，也有人担忧技术工具化将侵蚀编程的艺术性。",

          "content": "I'm 61 (retired when I was 57).I too began with BASIC (but closer to 1980). Although I wrote and published games for the Macintosh for a number of years as I finished up college, my professional career (in the traditional sense) began when I was hired by Apple in 1995 and relocated to the Bay Area.Yeah, what started out as a great just got worse and worse as time went on.I suspect though that to a large degree this reflects both the growing complexity of the OS over that time as well as the importance of software in general as it became more critical to people's lives.Already, even in 1984 when it was first introduced, the Mac had a rich graphics library you would not want to have to implement yourself. (Although famously of course a few apps like Photoshop nonetheless did just that—leaning on the Mac simply for a final call to CopyBits() to display pixels from Adobe's buffer to the screen.)You kind of have to accept abstraction when networking, multiple cores, multiple processes become integral to the machine. I guess I always understood that and did not feel too put out by it. If anything a good framework was somewhat of a relief—someone else's problem, ha ha. (And truly a beautiful API is just that: a beautiful thing. I enjoy working well constructed frameworks.)But the latter issue, the increasing dominance of software on our lives is what I think contributed more to poisoning the well. Letting the inmates run the asylum more or less describes the way engineering worked when I began at Apple in 1995. We loved it that way. (Say what you want about that kind of bottom-up culture of that era, but our \"users\" were generally nerds just like us—we knew, or thought we knew anyway, better than marketing what the customer wanted and we pursued it.)Agile development, unit tests, code reviews… all these weird things began to creep in and get in the way of coding. Worse, they felt like busywork meant simply to give management a sense of control… or some metric for progress.\"What is our code coverage for unit test?\" a manager might ask. \"90%,\" comes the reply from engineering. \"I want to see 95% coverage by next month,\" comes the marching orders. Whatever.I confess I am happy to have now left that arena behind. I still code in my retirement but it's back to those cowboy-programmer days around this house.Yee haw!",

If you were a smart dev before AI, chances are you will remain a smart dev with AI.My experience so far is that to a first approximation, the quality of the code/software generated with AI corresponds to the quality of the developer using the AI tool surprisingly well. An inexperienced, bad dev will still generate a sub-par result while a great dev can produce great results.The choices involved in using these tools are also not as binary as they are often made out to be, especially since agents have taken off. You can very much still decide to dedicate part of your day to chiseling away at important code to make it just right and make sure your brain is engaged in the result and exploring and growing with the problem at hand, while feeding background queues of agents with other tasks.I would in fact say the biggest challenge of the AI tool revolution in terms of what to adapt to is just good ol' personal time management.",

When you become a lead you have to let go and get comfortable with the idea that the code is not going to be how you would do it. You can look at code produced by your team and attempt to replace it all with your craftsmanship but you're just setting yourself up to fail. The right approach is use your wisdom to make the team better, not the code. I think a lot of that applies to using AI when coding.I'm turning 50 in April and am pretty excited about AI coding assistants. They make a lot of personal projects I've wanted to do but never had the time feasible.",

I find this to be very much like using AI for coding.Which also makes me refute the idea that AI coding is just another rung up on the programming abstraction ladder. Depending on how much you delegate to AI, I don't think it's really programming at all. It's project management. That's not a bad thing! But it's not really still programming.Even just in the context of my human team, I feel less mentally engaged with the code. I don't know what everything does. (In principle, I could know, but I don't.) I see some code written in a way that differs from how I would have done it. But I'm not the one working day-in, day-out with the code. I'll ask questions, make suggestions, but I'm not going to force something unless I think it's really super important.That said, I don't 100% like this. I enjoy programming. I enjoy computer science. I especially enjoy things more down the paths of algorithm design, Lisp, and the intersection of programming with mathematics. On my team, I do still do some programming. I could delegate it entirely, but I indulge myself and do a little bit.I personally think that's a good path with AI too. I think we're at the point where, for many software application tasks, the programming could be entirely hands-off. Let AI do it all. But if I wish to, why not indulge in doing some myself also? Yeah, I know, I know, I'll get \"left behind in the dust\" and all of that. I'm not sure that I'm in that much of a hurry to churn out 50,000 lines of code a day; I'm cool with 45,100.",

It is still possible to build magical things. But agents aren't it, I don't think.It is honestly extremely depressing  to read this coming from a founder of Relic. Relic built magic. Dawn of War and Company of Heroes formed an important part of my teenage years. I formed connections, spent thousands of hours enjoying them together with other people, and pushed myself hard to become one of the top 100 players on the CoH leaderboards. Those competitive multiplayer games taught me everything there was to know about self-improvement, and formed the basis of my growth as an individual - learning that if I put my mind to it, I could be among the best at something, informed my worldview and led me to a life of perpetually pushing myself to further self-improvement, and from there I learned to code, draw, and play music. All of that while being part of amazing communities where I formed friendships that lasted decades.All of this to say, Relic was magic. The work Relic did profoundly impacted my life. I wonder if you really believe your current role, \"building trust infrastructure for AI agents\", is actually magic? That it's going to profoundly impact the lives of thousands or millions?I'm sorry for the jumbled nature of this post. I am on my phone, so I can't organize my thoughts as well as I would like. I am grateful to you for founding Relic, and this post probably comes off stupidly combative and ungrateful. But I would simply like to pose to you, to have a long think if what you're doing now is really where the magic is.Edit: On further consideration, it's not clear the newly-created account I'm responding to is actually Alex Garden. The idea of potentially relating this personal anecdote to an impersonator is rather embarrassing, but I will nonetheless leave this up in the hope that if there are people who built magical things reading this, regardless of whether they're Alex Garden or someone else, that it might just inspire them to introspection about what building magic means, about the impact software can have on people's lives even if you don't see it, and whether this \"agent\" stuff is really it.",

And now there's an AI that can solve the puzzle -- it defeats the purpose.However, if your point was to \"make more widgets faster\" and only saw programming as a means to an end (make money, increase SaaS features), then I see why people are super excited about it.I see it the same way as cooking.  If your goal is \"sell as many hamburgers as possible\" then the McD / factory farm is the way to go.  If your idea is \"I enjoy the personal feeling of preparing the food, smelling the ingredients, feeling like I'm developing my craft of cooking, and love watching someone eat my hand-prepared meal\", then having \"make fast food machine\" actually makes things worse.I think a lot of people in this forum are at odds because some of the people enjoy cooking for the experience, and the other half are just trying to make food startups.  Now they can create and throw away menu items at record pace until they find the one that maximizes return.  They never wanted to cook, they just wanted to have a successful restaurant.  Nothing wrong with either approach, but the 2nd half (the software is just a product half) were hamstrung before, so now they are having a moment of excitement as they realize they don't have to care about coding anymore.I 100% guarantee that most of the MBA / startup founder types who didn't love coding for its own sake kind of felt a huge pain that they had to \"play along\" with devs talking about frameworks, optimal algos, and \"code quality\" and the like, all while paying them massive salaries and equity stakes for what they saw as disposable item to increase revenue.  Meanwhile the devs want another 2-weeks and 6 figures of salaries so they can \"refactor\" for no visible difference, but you can't complain because they'll leave.Now that the code factory is in place, they can focus on what they really want, finding customers for an item.  Its the drop-shipping of code and software.  The people using drop-shipping don't care what the product is. Production and fulfillment are just impediments to the real goal -- selling a product.The actual revelation of AI, if one can call it that, is how few people care about craft, quality, or enjoying work.  Watching AI slop videos, ads, and music makes one realize that true artists and craftspeople are still incredibly rare.  Most people are mediocre, unimaginative, disinterested, and just want the shortest path to easy riches.  While it sounds negative, its more like realizing most people aren't athletes or interested in very difficult physical exertion -- its just a fact of human nature.  True athletes who love sport for its own sake are rare and in a way nonsensical on their face.In the end, we will probably lament something we lose in the process.  The same way we've hollowed out culture, local businesses, family / relationships, the middle class, etc all in the name of progress before.

          "content": "If we've arrived at the point where bots are impersonating me (instead of the billions of other choices), I'm probably at peak Alex.  I'll light a candle.  So... easy to disambiguate this one.I got the idea for Homeworld one night when I was about 21.  At the time, I was working at EA as a programmer on Triple Play 98 (building FE gfx - not glamorous).  In an RTS-ironic twist of fate, my boss and mentor at the time was Chris Taylor - go figure.Friends of mine had their own game company and had boxed themselves into a technical corner they couldn't get out of, so I agreed to write a bunch of sprite conversion code for them after hours.  That night, we were all working in a room, talking about the reasons X-Wing vs. Tie Fighter didn't work on a 2D screen (hold up and left till you turn inside and shoot) and how Battlestar Galactica didn't get the cred it deserved, and BOOM - in my mind I saw ships in 3D with trails behind them.  Inside a crystal sphere like Ptolomy's theory of the universe (man inside - god outside), and I saw that the surface of a sphere is 2D, so you could orbit OUTSIDE with a mouse... it looked like spaghetti floating in zero g... that's why Homeworld's working title was \"Spaghetti Ball\" for months.Fortunately for me, in this ambiguous thread, I can give you all the proof of life you want.  Try me.Now... is transparent and trustworthy casting spells?  Yeah... it is, but not by itself.  It's a primitive - a building block.  My personal projects (that I do think are magical) kept running into the same problems.  Effectively, \"how do I give up the keys if I don't really know what the driver is going to do?\"  I tried coming at this problem 10 different ways, and they all ended up in the same place.So I decided to go back to the basics - the putpixel(x,y) of agentic workflows, and that led me to transparency and trust.  And now, the things I'm building feel magical AND sustainable. Fun.  Fast... and getting faster.  I love that.At Relic, our internal design philosophy was \"One Revolutionary and Multiple Evolutionary\". The idea was that if you tried to do more than one mind-blowing new thing at a time, the game started feeling like work.  You can see this in the evolution of design from Homeworld to DoW to CoH (and in IC too, but let's face it, that game had issues <-- my fault).Now... on the topic of \"Is agentic coding better or worse\", I feel like that's asking \"is coding in assembler better or worse\".  The answer (at least used to be) \"it depends\"... You're on a continuum, deciding between traditional engineering (tightly controlled and 100% knowable) and multi-agentic coding (1,000x more productive but taking a lot for granted).  I've found meaning here by accepting that full-power multi-agentic harnesses (I rolled my own - it's fucking awesome) turn software engineering into Socratic debate and philosophy.I don't think it's better.  It's just different, and it lets you do different things.",

          "content": "Hey, Boris from the Claude Code team here. I wanted to take a sec to explain the context for this change.One of the hard things about building a product on an LLM is that the model frequently changes underneath you. Since we introduced Claude Code almost a year ago, Claude has gotten more intelligent, it runs for longer periods of time, and it is able to more agentically use more tools. This is one of the magical things about building on models, and also one of the things that makes it very hard. There's always a feeling that the model is outpacing what any given product is able to offer (ie. product overhang). We try very hard to keep up, and to deliver a UX that lets people experience the model in a way that is raw and low level, and maximally useful at the same time.In particular, as agent trajectories get longer, the average conversation has more and more tool calls. When we released Claude Code, Sonnet 3.5 was able to run unattended for less than 30 seconds at a time before going off the rails; now, Opus 4.6 1-shots much of my code, often running for minutes, hours, and days at a time.The amount of output this generates can quickly become overwhelming in a terminal, and is something we hear often from users. Terminals give us relatively few pixels to play with; they have a single font size; colors are not uniformly supported; in some terminal emulators, rendering is extremely slow. We want to make sure every user has a good experience, no matter what terminal they are using. This is important to us, because we want Claude Code to work everywhere, on any terminal, any OS, any environment.Users give the model a prompt, and don't want to drown in a sea of log output in order to pick out what matters: specific tool calls, file edits, and so on, depending on the use case. From a design POV, this is a balance: we want to show you the most relevant information, while giving you a way to see more details when useful (ie. progressive disclosure). Over time, as the model continues to get more capable -- so trajectories become more correct on average -- and as conversations become even longer, we need to manage the amount of information we present in the default view to keep it from feeling overwhelming.When we started Claude Code, it was just a few of us using it. Now, a large number of engineers rely on Claude Code to get their work done every day. We can no longer design for ourselves, and we rely heavily on community feedback to co-design the right experience. We cannot build the right things without that feedback. Yoshi rightly called out that often this iteration happens in the open. In this case in particular, we approached it intentionally, and dogfooded it internally for over a month to get the UX just right before releasing it; this resulted in an experience that most users preferred.But we missed the mark for a subset of our users. To improve it, I went back and forth in the issue to understand what issues people were hitting with the new design, and shipped multiple rounds of changes to arrive at a good UX. We've built in the open in this way before, eg. when we iterated on the spinner UX, the todos tool UX, and for many other areas. We always want to hear from users so that we can make the product better.The specific remaining issue Yoshi called out is reasonable. PR incoming in the next release to improve subagent output (I should have responded to the issue earlier, that's my miss).Yoshi and others -- please keep the feedback coming. We want to hear it, and we genuinely want to improve the product in a way that gives great defaults for the majority of users, while being extremely hackable and customizable for everyone else.",

          "content_cn": "大家好，我是Claude Code团队的Boris。我想花点时间解释一下这次改动的背景。基于大语言模型开发产品的一个难点在于，底层模型经常发生变化。自从我们近一年前推出Claude Code以来，Claude变得更智能了，能够持续运行更长时间，并且能更自主地使用更多工具。这是基于模型构建产品的奇妙之处，同时也是使其非常困难的因素之一。总有一种感觉，模型的进步速度超过了任何特定产品所能提供的功能（即产品滞后）。我们努力跟上步伐，提供一种用户体验，让人们既能以原始、底层的方式接触模型，同时又能获得最大化的实用性。\n\n特别是随着智能体运行轨迹变长，平均对话中工具调用的次数越来越多。当我们发布Claude Code时，Sonnet 3.5模型每次只能无人值守运行不到30秒就会出错；而现在，Opus 4.6模型常常能一次性完成我的大部分代码任务，持续运行时间可达数分钟、数小时甚至数天。\n\n在终端中，这种输出量很快就会变得难以应对，这也是我们经常从用户那里听到的反馈。终端给我们提供的像素空间相对有限；它们只有单一的字体大小；颜色支持并不统一；在某些终端模拟器中，渲染速度极慢。我们希望确保每位用户都能获得良好的体验，无论他们使用的是什么终端……"

While refactoring my code it noticed that it needs to see what this command is which it is invoking, so it even went so far as to search through vs code's user data to find the recent files history if it can find out more about that command... I stopped it and told it that if it has problems, it should tell me. It explained it can't find that file, i gave it the paths and tokens were saved.

It's giving the operator enough visibility into what the agent is actually doing without drowning them in noise. There's a narrow band between \"Read 3 files\" (useless) and a full thinking trace dump (unusable), and finding it requires treating observability as a first-class design problem, not a verbosity slider.The frustrating part is that Anthropic clearly understands this in other contexts. Their own research on agent safety talks extensively about the need for human oversight of autonomous actions. But the moment it's their own product, the instinct is to simplify away the exact information that makes oversight possible.The people pinning to 2.1.19 aren't being difficult. They're telling you that when an agent touches my codebase, I need to know which files it read and what it searched for — not because I want to micromanage, but because that's literally the minimum viable audit trail.

Voila: you've re-invented product management.But I actually think it's good to source PM's from people who've been engineers for a few years.

The company needed to sell the product to pay us, and sales talked with potential buyers about what might swing their purchase decision and what they would pay extra for. Since the PM only talked to users and ignored sales when doing product design and product roadmaps, the way sales input got integrated into product development is that we frequently got top-down directives from management to prioritize one-off requests from sales over the roadmap.

Now this is a solved problemI wish…Detecting text encoding is only easy if all you need to contend with is UTF16-with-BOM, UTF8-with-BOM, UTF8-without-BOM, and plain ASCII (which is effectively also UTF8). As soon as you might see UTF16 or UCS without a BOM, or 8-bit codepages other than plain ASCII (many apps/libs assume that these are always CP1252, a superset of the printable characters of ISO-8859-1, which may not be the case), things are not fully deterministic.Thankfully UTF8 has largely won out over the many 8-bit encodings, but that leaves the interesting case of UTF8-with-BOM. The standard recommends against using it, that plain UTF8 is the way to go, but to get Excel to correctly load a UTF8 encoded CSV or similar you must include the BOM (otherwise it assumes CP 1252 and characters above 127 are corrupted). But… some apps/libs are completely unaware that UTF8-with-BOM is a thing at all so they load such files with the first column header corrupted.Source: we have clients pushing & pulling (or having us push/pull) data back & forth in various CSV formats, and we see some oddities in what we receive and what we are expected to send more regularly than you might think. The real fun comes when something at the client's end processes text badly (multiple steps with more than one of them incorrectly reading UTF8 as CP1252, for example) before we get hold of it, and we have to convince them that what they have sent is non-deterministically corrupt and we can't reliably fix it on the receiving end…",

The code stays exactly the same, we just add context as first-class metadata. When you push your commit, Checkpoints also pushes this metadata to a separate branch (entire/checkpoints/v1), giving you a complete, append-only audit log inside your repository. As a result, every change can now be traced back not only to a diff, but to the reasoning that produced it.The context for every single turn could in theory be nearly 1MB.  Since this context is being stored in the repo and constantly changing, after a thousand turns, won't it make just doing a \"git checkout\" start to be really heavy?For example, codex-cli stores every single context for a given session in a jsonl file (in .codex).  I've easily got that file to hit 4 GB in size, just working for a few days; amusingly, codex-cli would then take many GB of RAM at startup.   I ended up writing a script that trims the jsonl history automatically periodically.   The latest codex-cli has an optional sqlite store for context state.My guess is that by \"context\", Checkpoints doesn't actually mean the contents of the context window, but just distilled reasoning traces, which are more manageable... but still can be pretty large.",

The laziness shows in the output matching the letter of the prompt but with as high \"code entropy\" as possible.What I mean by \"code entropy\" is, for example, copy-paste-tweak (high entropy) is always easier (on the short term) for LLMs (and humans) to output than defining a function to hold concepts common across the pastes with the \"tweak\" represented by function arguments.LLMs will produce high entropy output unless constrained to produce lower entropy (\"better\") code.Until/unless LLMs are trained to actually apply craft learned by experienced humans, we must be explicit in our prompts.For example, I get good results from say Claude Sonnnet when my instruction include:- Statements of specific file, class, function names to use.- Explicit design patterns to apply.  (\"loop over the outer product of lists of choices for each category\")- Implementation hints (\"use itertools.product() to iterate over the combinations\")- And, \"ask questions if you are uncertain\" helps trigger an iteration to quickly clarify something instead of fixing the resulting code.This specificity makes prompting a lot more work but it pays off.  I only go this far when I care about the resulting code.  And, I still often \"retouch\" as you also describe.OTOH, when I'm vibing I'll just give end goals and let the slop flow.",

I want to get my car washed, should I drive there or walk?\"Here is Claude's answer just right now:\"Walk! At only 50 meters (about 150 feet), it would take you less than a minute to walk there. Driving such a short distance would actually be less convenient - by the time you get in the car, start it, drive, and park, you could already be there on foot.\nPlus, you'd save fuel and your car would be right there waiting for you after the wash is done.\"Here is ChatGPT, also right now:\"Since it’s only *50 meters* (about 160 feet), walking makes a lot more sense.Here’s why:*  *It’s extremely close* — you’ll get there in under a minute.\n*  *Driving would actually be less efficient* — by the time you start the car, move it, and park, you’re already there.\n*  *Cold starts aren’t great for your engine* — very short drives don’t let the engine warm up properly.\n*  *It saves fuel and emissions*, even if it’s a tiny amount.\n*  You avoid the hassle of maneuvering such a short distance.The only time driving might make sense is if:* The weather is terrible (heavy rain, snow, extreme cold).\n* You have mobility issues.\n* The car wash requires you to stay in the vehicle and you don’t want to leave it there.Otherwise, this is a perfect “walk it over” situation. \n\"Please save us all that talk about frontier and SOTA and that only the closedAI models are any good and the others are all so bad and benchmaxxed.

And even if a superintelligence uses these resources more effectively than humans to improve itself, it is still bound by the scaling of improvements I mentioned before — linear improvements need exponential resources. Diminishing returns can be avoided by switching to more independent problems – like adding one-off features to GPUs – but these quickly hit their own diminishing returns.Literally everyone already knows the problems with scaling compute and data.

      "abstract": "该讨论围绕“温室地球轨迹风险”展开，核心关注气候变化是否已进入不可逆的加速阶段。有人认为气候变化是真实危机，个人选择能影响其进程，但也用户指出将责任归咎于消费者是转移焦点，真正问题在于化石燃料行业的外部成本未被承担。讨论中提到，部分用户质疑气候变化的特殊性，指出地球历史上存在周期性变暖，甚至有人认为应加速变暖以推迟冰川期来临。分歧明显体现在对现状的评估：一方认为升温已触发水蒸气反馈的恶性循环，另一方则相信通过技术手段（如平流层气溶胶注入）总能逆转变暖。共识在于多数用户认同政策与公众认知不足，低估了地球系统状态转换的风险。同时，可再生能源的发展被视作积极信号，有望加速能源转型。此外，有用户提及气候变化已影响生育决策，体现了问题的社会深度。",

It is a problem that requires solutions, but implementing these solutions involves so much inertia that it can sometimes be painful.And let's contrast that with the AI hype. It's more the opposite, a kind of solution to problems we didn't really have, but are now being persuaded we do. It would be sensible to invest an equal share of the resources currently being pumped into AI with uncertain outcomes into the complex issue of climate change. And, no, AI won't solve it; unfortunately, it only makes it worse.",

It's transparent blame-shifting.The fossil energy industry pulls the carbon out of the ground and distributes it globally.

There is little reason to think its stable. One could argue that we should push warming to prevent the coming glaciation. I rather suspect that would hasten it instead, but the runaway hot house thing is not supported by the historic record. Perhaps the collapse of the AMOC is what tips it. Either way, saying its the most whatever in 125K years is irrelevant since we should be aiming for conditions from before the ice age.

Naturally this is because culturally, we have defined our life in this way, and those who value money benefit from the existing culture.People who treat money as the only resource they need to navigate life stand to lose when things get expensive, but stand to lose even more when other forms of resource (energy, family connections, community) are needed.As an extension of this I think extreme wealth inequality won’t ever be solved by a more equal distribution of money, and only can be solved by a devaluing of money as compared to other resources and thus a reduction in the power that money has. It’s not surprising then that billionaires end up spending their money on what gives them more control rather than what is a sensible monetary decision, like Musk purchasing Twitter.",

People love to wax poetic on human adaptability, but we were effectively playing on \"easy\" mode.While the other side of climate change might be a more hostile earth, the transition period will be worse because you can't adapt. In our lifetimes we may live to see a period of record heat waves in Europe, followed by a transition of Europe to that is dramatically colder (and who knows, maybe back again).The other major problem is as stability decreases so does our ability to predict the future.

Where are you getting this information?Most MUDs implement RFC 854, and a number of non-standard Telnet option subnegotiation protocols have been adopted for compression (MCCP2), transmission of unrendered data (ATCP, GMCP, ZMP), and even a mechanism for enabling marking up the normal content using XML-style tags (MXP). These telopts build on the subnegotiation facility in standard Telnet, whose designers knew that the base protocol would be insufficient for many needs; there are a great number of IANA-controlled and standardized telopt codes that demonstrate this, and the MUD community has developed extensions using that same mechanism.> You can usually connect to a MUD using a Telnet client, but most players hate the experience and often deride this method in favor of a dedicated, programmable client.I think you are confusing \"telnet\" the program with \"telnet\" the protocol. I am speaking here of the protocol, defined at base in RFC 854, for which \"telnet\" the program is but one particularly common implementation. You look at any of those \"dedicated, programmable clients\" and they will contain an implementation of RFC 854, probably also an implementation of RFC 1143 (which nails down the rules of subnegotiation in order to prevent negotiation loops), and an implementation of the RFCs for several standard telopts as well as non-standardized MUD community telopts. I can speak for the behavior of MUSHclient in especial regard here, though I am also familiar with the underlying Telnet nature of Mudlet, ZMud, and CMUD, not to mention my very own custom-made prototype client for which I very much needed to implement Telnet as described above.",

Nobody verifies host keys, and with automation where hosts cycle, you basically have to disable verification as there's no easy way around the host keys constantly changing. Without host key verification, there's kinda no point to the rest.Even assuming the host keys were verified, the popular ssh conventions are to use either long-lived static keys (and almost nobody puts a password on theirs), or a password. Very few people use SSH with 2FA, and almost no-one uses ephemeral keys (OIDC) or certificates (which many people screw up).So in terms of how people actually use it, SSH is one of the least secure transport methods.

          "content": "I worked for an ISP in the mid-90s and had been on the Internet since 1989 or so. I recall the progression for me was something like this:We used telnet in college no problem. It was a fairly well-accepted method of remote access. The heterogeneous network had many different modes, but a major dialup point was the Annex box, which supported telnet into the Unix or VMS machines.Between Unix machines, we would often prefer \"rlogin\" instead. There were several horrific iterations of other remote-access protocols such as \"remsh\". rlogin was notorious for its \"/etc/hosts.equiv\" authorization method which trusted DNS and should've been perceived as Swiss Cheese from the outset. rlogin was, IIRC, directly related to rsh and rcp and used the same frameworks. rlogin was no more secure than telnet, but probably less secure because of its conveniences.We also used port 23/tcp for remote management, for example Cisco routers. They weren't running telnetd, but it was the port where you connected remotely and logged in with or without credentials.rlogin persisted alongside telnet, until encryption came into fashion and ssh was distributed. Once ssh was available and working well, everyone knew that telnetd and rlogind were on borrowed time. The services were shut down and disabled in inetd. The ports were sometimes blocked. Security advisories went out.I suppose it took a long, long time for ssh to finally dominate, and for people to abandon telnetd mostly, but it was fairly thorough. We all recognized the superiority of sshd's authentication and encrypted channels.There were mitigations for people to extend their legacy use of telnetd and rlogind. For example, tcp wrappers and fail2ban could be implemented. Firewall filters could select only authorized networks. VPNs could tunnel through an Intranet that still used them. So, the services lived on wherever they didn't need to be exposed on the public Internet. But I think most Unix admins got the picture by the end of the dot-com bubble.",

Electric charge is a kind of \"defect\" or \"kink\" in the photonic field, while color charge (quarks) are defects in the strong-force field, etc.When an electron-positron pair is formed from a vacuum, we get all sorts of interesting geometry which I struggle to grasp or picture clearly.

People are chipping away at it, and there's been slow but steady progress.One of the \"best\" approaches I've seen is \"The Harari-Shupe preon model and nonrelativistic quantum phase space\"[1] by Piotr Zenczykowski which makes the claim that just like how Schrodinger \"solved\" the quantum wave equation in 3D space by using complex numbers, it's possible to solve a slightly extended version of the same equation in 6D phase space, yielding matrices that have properties that match the Harari-Shupe preon model. The preon model claims that fundamental particles are further subdivided into preons, the \"charges\" of which neatly add up to the observed zoo of particle charges, and a simple additive algebra over these charges match Feyman diagrams. The preon model has issues with particle masses and binding energies, but Piotr's work neatly sidesteps that issue by claiming that the preons aren't \"particles\" as such, but just mathematical properties of these matrices.I put \"best\" in quotes above because there isn't anything remotely like a widely accepted theory for this yet, just a few clever people throwing ideas at the wall to see what sticks.[1] https://arxiv.org/abs/0803.0223",

If these conditions aren't satisfied, the mathematical model will fail pretty spectacularly.   It won't be unitary, can't couple consistently to gravity, won't allow high and low energy behavior to decouple,..For the Standard Model, the anomaly cancellation conditions imply that the sum of electric charges within a generation must vanish, which they do:3 colors of quark * ( up charge 2/3 - down charge 1/3) + electron charge -1 + neutrino charge 0 = 0.So, there's something quite special about the charge assignments in the Standard Model.  They're nowhere near as arbitrary as they could be a priori.Historically, this has been taken as a hint that the standard model should come from a simpler \"grand unified\" model.

I wonder if the results would be comparable if we replace ehtics+KPIs by any comparable pair and create a pressure on the model.In practical real-life scenarios this study is very interesting and applicable!

The architecture we experimented with ended up being how Grok works, and the mixed feedback it gets (both the power of it and the remarkable secret immorality of it) I think are expected outcomes.I think it will be really powerful once we figure out how to align AI to human goals in support of decisions, for people, businesses, governments, etc. but LLMs are far from being able to do this inherently and when you string them together in an agentic loop, even less so.

Ultimately \"judgement,\" however you wish to quantify that fuzzy concept, is not purely an optimization exercise. It's far more a probabilistic information function from incomplete or conflicting data.In product management (my domain), decisions are made under conflicting constraints: a big customer or account manager pushing hard, a CEO/board priority, tech debt, team capacity, reputational risk and market opportunity. PMs have tried with varied success to make decisions more transparent with scoring matrices and OKRs, but at some point someone has to make an imperfect judgment call that’s not reducible to a single metric. It's only defensible through narrative, which includes data.Also, progressive elaboration or iterations or build-measure-learn are inherently fuzzy. Reinertsen compared this to maximizing the value of an option. Maybe in modern terms a prediction market is a better metaphor. That's what we're doing in sprints, maximizing our ability to deliver value in short increments.I do get nervous about pushing agentic systems into roadmap planning, ticket writing, or KPI-driven execution loops. Once you collapse a messy web of tradeoffs into a single success signal, you’ve already lost a lot of the context.There’s a parallel here for development too. LLMs are strongest at greenfield generation and weakest at surgical edits and refactoring. Early-stage startups survive by iterative design and feedback. Automating that with agents hooked into web analytics may compound errors and adverse outcomes.So even if you strip out “ethics” and replace it with any pair of competing objectives, the failure mode remains.",

But I agree completely at being awful at decisions.I’ve been building a data-agent tool (similar to [1][2]). Gemini 3’s main failure cases are that it makes up metrics that really are not appropriate, and it will use inappropriate data and force it into a conclusion. When a task is clear + possible then it’s amazing. When a task is hard with multiple failure paths then you run into Gemini powering through to get an answer.Temperature seems to play a huge role in Gemini’s decision quality from what I see in my evals, so you can probably tune it to get better answers but I don’t have the recipe yet.Claude 4+ (Opus & Sonnet) family have been much more honest, but the short context windows really hurt on these analytical use cases, plus it can over-focus on minutia and needs to be course corrected.

          "content": "One way to sharpen the question is to stop asking whether C is \"fundamental\" and instead ask whether it is forced by mild structural constraints. From that angle, its status looks closer to inevitability than convenience.Take R as an ordered field with its usual topology and ask for a finite-dimensional, commutative, unital R-algebra that is algebraically closed and admits a compatible notion of differentiation with reasonable spectral behavior. You essentially land in C, up to isomorphism. This is not an accident, but a consequence of how algebraic closure, local analyticity, and linearization interact. Attempts to remain over R tend to externalize the complexity rather than eliminate it, for example by passing to real Jordan forms, doubling dimensions, or encoding rotations as special cases rather than generic elements.More telling is the rigidity of holomorphicity. The Cauchy-Riemann equations are not a decorative constraint; they encode the compatibility between the algebra structure and the underlying real geometry. The result is that analyticity becomes a global condition rather than a local one, with consequences like identity theorems and strong maximum principles that have no honest analogue over R.I’m also skeptical of treating the reals as categorically more natural. R is already a completion, already non-algebraic, already defined via exclusion of infinitesimals. In practice, many constructions over R that are taken to be primitive become functorial or even canonical only after base change to C.So while one can certainly regard C as a technical device, it behaves like a fixed point: impose enough regularity, closure, and stability requirements, and the theory reconstructs it whether you intend to or not. That does not make it metaphysically fundamental, but it does make it mathematically hard to avoid without paying a real structural cost.",

With other free variables, because the field's algebraically closed, you can fix π to whatever transcendental you like and still solve for the remaining variables. So it's something like, the rationals plus a continuum's worth of arbitrary field extensions? Not terribly surprising that all instances of this are isomorphic as fields but it's starting to feel about as useful as claiming the real numbers are \"up to set isomorphism, the unique set whose cardinality matches the power set of the natural numbers\", like, of course it's got automorphisms, you didn't finish defining it.",

No one ever saw \"two\", for example.Another thing to think about is the very nature of mathematical existence. In a certain perspective, no objects cannot exist in math. If you can think if an object with certain rules constraining it, voila, it exists, independent of whether a certain rule system prohibit its. All that matters is that we adhere to the rule system we have imagined into being. It does not exist in a certain mathematical axiomatic system, but then again axioms are by their very nature chosen.Now in that vein here is a deep thought: I think free will exists just because we can imagine a math object into being that is neither caused nor random.

Remember that historically, not every civilization even had a number for zero. Likewise, mathematicians struggled with a generalized solution to the Quadratic. The problem was that there were at least 6 possible equations to solve a quadratic without using negative numbers. Back then, its application was limited to area and negative numbers seemed irrelevant based on the absolute value nature of distance. It was only by abandoning our simplistic application rooted in reality that we could develop a single Quadratic Equation and with it open a new world of possibilities.",

I can only imagine world_state(t + ε) = f(world_state(t), true_random_number_source). And even in that case we do not know if such a thing as true_random_number_source exists. The future state is either a deterministic function of the current state or it is independent of it, of which we can think as being a deterministic function of the world state and some random numbers from a true random number source. Or a mixture of the two, some things are deterministic, some things are random.But neither being deterministic nor being random qualifies as free will for me. I get the point of compatibilists, we can define free will as doing what I want, even if that is just a deterministic function of my brain state and the environment, and sure, that kind of free will we have. But that is not the kind of free will that many people imagine, being able to make different decisions in the exact same situation, i.e. make a decision, then rewind the entire universe a bit, and make the decision again. With a different outcome this time but also not being a random outcome. I can not even tell what that would mean. If the choice is not random and also does not depend on the prior state, on what does it depend?The closest thing I can imagine is your brain deterministically picking two possible meals from the menu based on your preferences and the environment respectively circumstances, and then flipping a coin to make the final decision. The outcome is deterministically constraint by your preferences but ultimately a random choice within those constraints. But is that what you think of as free will? The decision result depends on you, which option you even consider, but the final choice within those acceptable options does not depend on you in any way and you therefore have no control over it.",

I’ve had cheap store brand models and cheaper Amazon MYSSNGVWL type stuff as well.  Knowing they would probably break didn’t make it feel better when they eventually broke.Anyway the new salad spinner is large, heavy, with a steel pin into a brass bushing, has a metal handle and nylon gears in a sealed gearbox with exposed stainless screws for servicing.  I opened it up and greased it on first use, mostly just to pretend to be servicing it, just to see what that felt like.  It felt good!The best part is it came with a catalogue that had order codes for spare parts.  They wanted to help you maintain it.  It was built to last and the manufacturer was on your side.https://www.dynamicmixers.com/en/our-products/salad-spinner/...I’m starting to feel silly writing all this about a salad spinner, but where is my car version of this?",

That $45,000 price they are throwing around could very well be for a trim that isn't even available at launch.And anyway if I were going to buy a new compact crossover today, I'd probably lean more toward the RAV4 PHEV.

I have often thought, that Europe will have a problem in the future with roads, as they are just too small, and expanding and making them more safe, is unlikely to ever happen and often times impossible. Not everyone can get by with a small little hatchback, some of us need a big pickup (I own a building company). And for the people that do not need it from a commercial point of view, have you ever considered that people have hobbies and some hobbies needs a fair amount of space in a car? Or families with multiple kids doing sport need the space for all the gear? \nI am worried that in the future, more and more european cities will just address the problem with a disguised \"we are making the cities car free, and thus greener and safer\". What that means for the average citizen out there is, that any building related work, will just become more expensive, as people will just charge more to get over the hassle of getting into the cities then.",

A 90s Honda Civic has a worse drag coefficient but a vastly smaller cross section than the Rivian, so it needs to move less air out of the way to drive forward. Smaller EVs can go farther with smaller batteries, but the American consumer has decided for one reason or another that cars must be tall, and therefore less aerodynamically efficient.",

      "abstract": "该帖子讨论了Oxide公司成功融资2亿美元的消息。核心话题围绕其高端硬件产品的市场定位和实际应用展开。\n\n社区普遍对Oxide团队表示祝贺，并认可其技术创新。有人认为其产品理念先进，但价格过高，不适合内部服务器需求或现有数据中心合作伙伴。也有用户指出，其商业模式类似云服务商按配置销售的方式，但在实际数据中心运营中，机柜的功率密度限制可能成为瓶颈。\n\n讨论中提到明显的分歧点：一方面，许多用户表达了对更小规格、适合家庭实验室或个人工作站的产品的强烈渴望，并表示如果推出此类产品会积极购买；另一方面，有用户对其市场定位感到困惑，询问如何理解“拥有自己付费的云服务”，并直接询问产品的实际定价和用户经验。\n\n共识在于，社区欣赏Oxide的技术成就，但对其当前产品是否能在更广阔市场获得成功持观望态度，主要疑虑集中在成本、适用场景和市场匹配度上。",

          "content": "Congratulations to the Oxide team! It's a tough market out there :)! I'm still personally frustrated that I don't get to play with the hardware (too expensive for our internal server needs; not the right fit for our datacenter partners/customers), but I'm excited to see that they're successful and hopefully they'll come around to my use case eventually :). In the meantime, I appreciate that they're building largely in the open - every once in a while I'll glance at their issue tracker for light bedtime reading. Just recently we had some fun internally throwing our controls software at their thermal loop as a usage example - it's often hard to find compelling real-world systems to use as openly sharable examples (of course we have interesting customer problems, but that's all NDA'd), so having companies build real stuff in the open is fantastic. Great company, wish them the best.",

          "content": "I get the whole x CPUs y RAM story (it's akin to how clouds sell) and that often makes sense in the cloud, but when managing my datacenter operations a big constraining point is compute / kW. At 30 A / 208 V at 85% efficiency I've got 5 kW to work with per cabinet. If I'm putting in low core density slow machines I've got to do a lot more management than if I'm using my Epyc 9755 based servers. This is a practical constraint not just a theoretical \"oh I want the latest and greatest\". It's just that I can't really justify using up 4U and a kW on an Epyc 7003 series. The compute density just isn't there for the power use. The old chips are practically deadweight.Anyway, I'm glad to hear of the raise because the team seems exceptional (judging by the posts you guys write and they have written prior to the company) and I love work in this area that simplifies hardware management. Good stuff, good luck, and congratulations!",

          "content_cn": "我完全理解那种“x核CPU加y内存”的配置逻辑（这和云服务的销售模式类似），在云端环境中这通常说得通。但在管理数据中心运营时，一个重要的制约因素是每千瓦电力对应的计算能力。以30安培、208伏特、85%的能效计算，每个机柜只有5千瓦的可用电力。如果我部署低核心密度、性能较慢的机器，就需要投入比使用基于Epyc 9755的服务器更多的管理精力。这是实际存在的限制，并非单纯追求“最新最强”的理论空谈。问题在于，我实在无法合理化用4U空间和一千瓦电力去部署Epyc 7003系列服务器——其计算密度与功耗完全不成正比，老款芯片几乎成了无效负载。\n\n无论如何，听到融资消息我很高兴，因为团队看起来非常出色（从你们以及公司成立前成员发布的文章可见一斑），而且我向来欣赏能简化硬件管理领域的创新工作。这是很棒的发展，祝你们顺利，恭喜成功！"

The CEO went out of his way to tell me he didn't like my resume since I've had to hop around a little bit to stay employed.Concerns that should have been handled in the initial call, somehow get pushed back till after I've wasted monumental amount of time.Things are looking up though, I'm starting a job soon and the entire interview process was more or less a 30 minute phone call with the technical manager. That's it, two days later or so I had a verbal offer. I don't need to change the world, I need to pay my rent.",

I ask because those are found in most engineering companies as far as I know (that do serious numerical work) as well as labs or universities (that can't afford the engineers and technicians companies can).Also, what is the meaning of calling an on-prem machine \"cloud\" anymore? I thought the whole point of the cloud was that the hardware had been abstracted (and moved) away and you just got resources on demand over the network. Basically I don't understand what they're selling if it's not what people already call clusters.

Second, it was nearly a three hour conversation -- I don't think I can be accused of not letting him talk?  Third, I definitely remember that I felt I had to interrupt him to move the conversation along.  Fourth, I had to pee really badly, I was absolutely freezing, and I was quite concerned about missing my flight to New Zealand that evening with my family for Christmas (which I damned near did) -- and I have no doubt that I was not at my best!I do try to get better at this stuff, and I re-listen to our episodes to improve as an interviewer.  If it's been \"a few years\", maybe you haven't listen too much to Oxide and Friends?  I think we've had some wonderful guests and great conversations over the span of the podcast -- though I also have no doubt that it's imperfect, for which you have my profound apologies![0] https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZkdpLSXUXHY",

That said, the way Google has factored the back-end of the renderer, it won't take a PhD to target one of those GPU APIs.Aside: GL is still a good practical choice for games built by small teams.",

          "content": "The author is correct in that agents are becoming more and more capable and that you don't need the IDE to the same extent, but I don't see that as good. I find that IDE-based agentic programming actually encourages you to read and understand your codebase as opposed to CLI-based workflows. It's so much easier to flip through files, review the changes it made, or highlight a specific function and give it to the agent, as opposed to through the CLI where you usually just give it an entire file by typing the name, and often you just pray that it manages to find the context by itself. My prompts in Cursor are generally a lot more specific and I get more surgical results than with Claude Code in the terminal purely because of the convenience of the UX.But secondly, there's an entire field of LLM-assisted coding that's being almost entirely neglected and that's code autocomplete models. Fundamentally they're the same technology as agents and should be doing the same thing: indexing your code in the background, filtering the context, etc, but there's much less attention and it does feel like the models are stagnating.I find that very unfortunate. Compare the two workflows:With a normal coding agent, you write your prompt, then you have to at least a full minute for the result (generally more, depending on the task), breaking your flow and forcing you to task-switch. Then it gives you a giant mass of code and of course 99% of the time you just approve and test it because it's a slog to read through what it did. If it doesn't work as intended, you get angry at the model, retry your prompt, spending a larger amount of tokens the longer your chat history.But with LLM-powered auto-complete, when you want, say, a function to do X, you write your comment describing it first, just like you should if you were writing it yourself. You instantly see a small section of code and if it's not what you want, you can alter your comment. Even if it's not 100% correct, multi-line autocomplete is great because you approve it line by line and can stop when it gets to the incorrect parts, and you're not forced to task switch and you don't lose your concentration, that great sense of \"flow\".Fundamentally it's not that different from agentic coding - except instead of prompting in a chatbox, you write comments in the files directly. But I much prefer the quick feedback loop, the ability to ignore outputs you don't want, and the fact that I don't feel like I'm losing track of what my code is doing.",

So I wanted to build a tool to dump info out of a PDB. But I have been diagnosed with extreme case of Rustophobiatis so I just can't touch rust code. Hence, the port to typescript.With my assistance it did the work in an afternoon and did it well. The code worked. I ran it against large PDB from SumatraPDF and it matched the output of other tools.In a way porting from one language to another is extreme case of refactoring and Claude did it very well.I think that in general (your experience notwithstanding) Claude Caude is excellent at refactorings.Here are 3 refactorings from SumatraPDF where I asked claude code to simplify code written by a human:https://github.com/sumatrapdfreader/sumatrapdf/commit/a472d3...\nhttps://github.com/sumatrapdfreader/sumatrapdf/commit/5624aa...\nhttps://github.com/sumatrapdfreader/sumatrapdf/commit/a40bc9...I hope you agree the code written by Claude is better than the code written by a human.Granted, those are small changes but I think it generalizes into bigger changes. I have few refactorings in mind I wanted to do for a long time and maybe with Claude they will finally be feasible (they were not feasible before only because I don't have infinite amount of time to do everything I want to do).",

What does the CEO do?a) Change the workweek to 4 hours a day so that all the engineers have better work/life balance since the same amount of work is being done.b) Fire half the engineers, make the 4 remaining guys pick up the slack, rinse and repeat until there's one guy left?Like, come on.

The project I’m on has had more rework than I care to contemplate and most of it stems from everyone’s coding agents failing to stay synced up with each other on the details and their human handlers not noticing the discrepancies until we’re well into systems integration work.If I may hijack your analogy, it would be like if all the construction crews got really fast at their work,  so much so that the city decided to go for an “iterative construction” strategy because, in isolation, the cost of one team trying different designs on-site until they hit on one they liked became very small compared to the cost of getting city planners and civil engineers involved up-front. But what wasn’t considered was the rework multiplier effect that comes into play when the people building the water, sewage, electricity, telephones, roads, etc. are all repeatedly tweaking designs with minimal coordination amongst each other. So then those tweaks keep inducing additional design tweaks and rework on adjacent contractors because none of these design changes happen in a vacuum. Next thing you know all the houses are built but now need to be rewired because the electricity panel is designed for a different mains voltage from the drop and also it’s in the wrong part of the house because of a late change from overhead lines in the alleys to underground lines below the street.Many have observed that coding agents lack object permanence so keeping them on a coherent plan requires giving them such a thoroughly documented plan up front. It actually has me wondering if optimal coding agent usage at scale resembles something of a return to waterfall (probably in more of a Royce sense than the bogeyman agile evangelists derived from the original idea) where the humans on the team mostly spend their time banging out systems specifications and testing protocols, and iteration on the spec becomes somewhat more removed from implementing it than it is in typical practice nowadays.",

I want to say \"obviously\", which means that maybe I am misunderstanding you. Below are some examples of negative sentiments programmers have - can you explain why you are not counting these?NOTE: I am not presenting these as an \"LLMs are bad\" argument. My own feelings go both ways. There is a lot that's great about LLMs, and I don't necessarily agree with every word I've written below - some of it is just my paraphrasing of what other people say. I'm only listing examples of what drives existing anti-LLM sentiment in programmers.1. Job loss, loss of income, or threat thereofThese two are exacerbated by the pace of change, since so many people already spent their lives and money establishing themselves in the career and can't realistically pivot without becoming miserable - this is the same story for every large, fast change - though arguably this one is very large and very fast even by those standards. Lots of tech leadership is focusing even more than they already were on cheap contractors, and/or pushing employees for unrealistic productivity increases. I.e. it's exacerbating the \"fast > good\" problem, and a lot of leadership is also overestimating how far it reduces the barrier to creating things, as opposed to mostly just speeding up a person's existing capabilities. Some leadership is also using the apparent loss of job security as leverage beyond salary suppression (even less proportion of remote work allowed, more surveillance, worse office conditions, etc).2. Happiness loss (in regards to the job itself, not all the other stuff in this list)This is regarding people who enjoy writing/designing programs but don't enjoy directing LLMs; or who don't enjoy debugging the types of mistakes LLMs tend to make, as opposed to the types of mistakes that human devs tend to make. For these people, it's like their job was forcibly changed to a different, almost unrelated job, which can be miserable depending on why you were good at - or why you enjoyed - the old job.3. Uncertainty/skepticismI'm pushing back on your dismissal of this one as \"not anti-LLM sentiment\" - the comparison doesn't make sense. If I was forced to only review junior dev code instead of ever writing my own code or reviewing experienced dev code, I would be unhappy. And I love teaching juniors! And even if we ignore the subset of cases where it doesn't do a good job or assume it will soon be senior-level for every use case, this still overlaps with the above problem: The mistakes it makes are not like the mistakes a human makes. For some people, it's more unnatural/stressful to keep your eyes peeled for the kinds of mistakes it makes. For these people, it's a shift away from objective, detail-oriented, controlled, concrete thinking; away from the feeling of making something with your hands; and toward a more wishy-washy creation experience that can create a feeling of lack of control.4. Expertise lossA lot of positive outcomes with LLMs come from being already experienced. Some argue this will be eroded - both for new devs and existing experienced devs.5.

Art from comic book artists, art from manga-style creators, \"weird art\", even a make-up artist who painted a scene from Where the Wild Things Are on her face.I like this. What's more, while AI-generated art has a characteristic sameyness to it, the human-produced art stands out in its originality. It has character and soul. Even if it's bad! AI slop has made the human-created stuff seem even more striking by comparison. The market for human art isn't going anywhere, just like the audience for human-played chess went nowhere after Deep Blue. I think people will pay a premium for it, just to distinguish themselves from the slop. The same is true of writing and especially music. I know of no one who likes listening to AI-generated music. Even Sabrina Carpenter would raise less objection.The same, I'm afraid, cannot be said for software—because there is little value for human expression in the code itself. Code is—almost entirely—strictly utilitarian. So we are now at an inflection point where LLMs can generate and validate code that's nearly as good, if not better, than what we can produce on our own. And to not make use of them is about as silly as Mel Kaye still punching in instruction opcodes in hex into the RPC-4000, while his colleagues make use of these fancy new things called \"compilers\". They're off building unimaginably more complex software than they could before, but hey, he gets his pick of locations on the rotating memory drum!I'm one of the nonexistent anti-LLMers when it comes to software. I hate talking to a clanker, whose training data set I don't even have access to let alone the ability to understand how my input affects its output, just to do what I do normally with the neural net I've carried around in my skull and trained extensively for this very purpose. I like working directly with code. Code is not just a product for me; it is a medium of thought and expression. It is a formalized notation of a process that I can use to understand and shape that process.But with the right agentic loops, LLMs can just do more, faster. There's really no point in resisting. The marginal value of what I do has just dropped to zero.",

There's several reasons for this. 1) a smaller model doesn't have as good deep reasoning, so it works okay for a simple ask. 2) small context, small task, small model can produce better results than big context, big task, big model. The lost-in-the-middle problem is still unsolved, leading to mistakes that get worse with big context, and longer runs exacerbate issues. So small context/task that ends and starts a new loop (with planning & learning) ends up working really well and quickly.There's a difference between tasks and problem-solving, though.

Then I have one that puts the RSS icon back in the address bar, because Mozilla feels that RSS is less important than having the address bar show me special dates, and two that removes very specific things: One for cookie popups and one for removing sign in with Google.The only one of these I feel should actually be a plugin is my password manager. Privacy management (including cookies), RSS and containers could just be baked into Firefox. All of those seems more relevant to me than AI.Maybe adding a GreaseMonkey lite could fix the rest of my problem, using code I write and control.",

          "content": "Think about the Industrial Age transition from individual craftspeople working on small shops using hand tools to make things into working in factories on large-scale assembly lines. The latter is wildly more productive than the former. If you owned a business that employed a bunch of cobblers, then moving them all out of their little shops into one big factory where they can produce 100x as many shoes means you just got yourself 100x richer.But for an individual cobbler, you basically got fired at one job and hired at another. This may come as a surprise to those who view work as simply an abstract concept that produces value units, but people actually have preferences about how they spend their time. If you're a cobbler, you might enjoy your little workshop, slicing off the edge of leather around the heel, hammering in the pegs, sitting at your workbench.The nature of the work and your enjoyment of it is a fundamental part of the compensation package of a job.You might not want to quit that job and get a different job running a shoe assembly line in a factory. Now, if the boss said \"hey, since you're all going to be so much more productive working in the factory, we'll give you all 10x raises\" then perhaps you might be more excited about putting down your hammer. But the boss isn't saying that. He's saying \"all of the cobblers at the other companies are doing this to, so where are you gonna go?\".Of course AI is a top-down mandate. For people who enjoy reading and writing code themselves and find spending their day corralling AI agents to be a less enjoyable job, then the CEO has basically given them a giant benefits cut with zero compensation in return.",

The closest was the early 00s offshoring boom before it peaked and was rationalized/rolled back to some degree.

As it currently exists, AI adoption is a bottom-up decision at the individual level, not a total corporate reorganization. Continuing your analogy, it's more akin to letting craftspeople bring whatever tools they want to work, whether those be hand tools or power tools.

          "content": "I feel like the lag-time of communication was an important component of older forms of communication that has been lost. That's not to say that fast communication isn't a boon to society, of course. Only that slower communication gives you more flexibility in how you respond, and more time to think about what your response should be.When the main form of long distance communication was the postal system, and letters took days to travel from sender to receiver, you could easily wait days, if not weeks, to draft up your reply and mail it out. The recipient on the other end wouldn't even be able to discern the difference between your delay and the delay from the postal network itself. It had some in-built slack.When the only phones were landlines, if someone called you and you knew you were in a bad mood, the kind of bad mood that would invariably make you say something stupid, you could just not pick up! There were plenty of common, understandable reasons someone wouldn't be available to answer their landline. Then they could leave you a message, and you could call back when you mood improved again. Again, there was slack built into the system.Now there's this cultural expectation that puts far more attention on your reaction speed. A text message with no immediate response could just be them not seeing it immediately... But actually no! Now we have read receipts too! You can't even pretend to have not seen it yet while you think of your reply. Some platforms even have the little \"currently typing\" indicator tell them how long you've spent drafting and re-drafting whatever message you ended up sending. A panopticon of communication. Now there's no slack. Any person anywhere in the world could try and get a hold of you with the same expectation of immediacy that a face-to-face conversation would supply.Now of course, not every single person I might text, call, or send an email to, will have the same expectations for what is an appropriate degree of responsiveness. But, (speaking from my personal experience) I am absolutely miserable at reading that from social clues. I am left having to assume that, in the absence of some clear indicator to the contrary, whoever I am writing to will actually have rather strict expectations, and that allowing myself to be lax may very well give them a terrible opinion of me. (Though, the degree to which their opinion of me actually matters is a different question entirely!)",

Discord seems to have intentionally softened its age-verification steps so it can tell regulators, “we’re doing something to protect children,” while still leaving enough wiggle room that technically savvy users can work around it.But in practice, this only holds if regulators are either inattentive or satisfied with checkbox compliance. If a government is competent and motivated, this approach won’t hold up—and it may even antagonize regulators by looking like bad-faith compliance.I’ve also heard that some governments are already pushing for much stricter age-verification protocols, precisely because people can bypass weaker checks—for example, by using a webcam with partial face covering to confuse ID/face matching. I can’t name specific vendors, but some providers are responding by deploying stronger liveness checks that are significantly harder to game. And many services are moving age verification into mobile apps, where simple JavaScript-based tricks are less likely to work.",

          "content": "The comments so far assume that Discord / Twitch / Snapchat don't care as entities that people will start bypassing their age verification systems. I believe the rank-and-file think that's the case. I think even the engineers and PMs think that's the case. But that's not the game.There are many ways in which such a system could be implemented. They could have asked people to use a credit card. Adult entertainment services have been using this as a way to do tacit age verification for a very long time now. Or, they could have made a new zero-knowledge proof system. Or, ideally, they could have told the authorities to get bent.Tech is hardly the first industry to face significant (justifiable or unjustifiable) government backlash. I am hesitant to use them as examples as they're a net harm, whereas this is about preventing a societal net harm, but the fossil fuel and tobacco industries fought their governments for decades and straight up changed the political system to suit them.FAANG are richer than they ever were. Even Discord can raise more and deploy more capital than most of the tobacco industry at the time. It's also a righteous cause. A cause most people can get behind (see: privacy as a selling point for Apple and the backlash to Ring). But they're not fighting this. They're leaning into it.Let's take a look at what they're asking from people for a second, the face scan,    If you choose Facial Age Estimation, you’ll be prompted to record a short video selfie of your face. The Facial Age Estimation technology runs entirely on your device in real time when you are performing the verification. That means that facial scans never leave your device, and Discord and vendors never receive it. We only get your age group.\n\n\nTheir specific ask is to try and get depth data by moving the phone back and forth. This is not just \"take a selfie\" – they're getting the user to move the device laterally to extract facial structure. The \"face scan\" (how is that defined??) never leaves the device, but that doesn't mean the biometric data isn't extracted and sent to their third-party supplier, k-Id. From the article,    k-id, the age verification provider discord uses doesn't store or send your face to the server. instead, it sends a bunch of metadata about your face and general process details.\n\nThe author assumes that \"this [approach] is good for your privacy.\" It's not. If you give me the depth data for a face, you've given me the fingerprint for that face. A machine doesn't need pictures; \"a bunch of metadata\" will do just fine.Discord is also doing profiling along vectors (presumably behavioral and demographic features) which the author describes as,    after some trial and error, we narrowed the checked part to the prediction arrays, which are outputs, primaryOutputs and raws.\n\n    turns out, both outputs and primaryOutputs are generated from raws. basically, the raw numbers are mapped to age outputs, and then the outliers get removed with z-score (once for primaryOutputs and twice for outputs).\n\nDiscord plugs into games and allows people to share what they're doing with their friends. For example, Discord can automatically share which song a user is listening on Spotify with their friends (who can join in), the game they're playing, whether they're streaming on Twitch etc. In general, Discord seems to have fairly reliable data about the other applications the user is running. Discord also has data about your voice (which they say they may store) and now your face.Is some or all of this data being turned into features that are being fed to this third-party k-ID? https://www.k-id.com/https://www.forbes.com/sites/mattgardner1/2024/06/25/k-id-cl...https://www.techinasia.com/a16z-lightspeed-bet-singapore-par...k-ID is (at first glance) extracting fairly similar data from Snapchat, Twitch etc. With ID documents added into the mix, this certainly seems like a very interesting global profiling dataset backstopped with government documentation as ground truth. :)",

And once the mechanism is dead, no matter how clean and whole it is, no matter how much you try to warm it up, blow on it—if the spiral spring is missing—the man is gone.Yet I can do something to live longer. Thoughts have a definite length. I can unwind them very fast—then the end comes quickly, or I may unwind them slowly, and the end will come more slowly. When we live as we do we think mechanically and quite unnecessarily. We very seldom think when necessary. So we could be much more economical.The secret is very simple. If any man really succeeds in understanding and learning to spend only as much as is necessary he will be able to economize a great deal of energy.Now look inwards at your thinking. You will see that you think all the time, associations flow on unceasingly. Now if you begin to think intentionally, you will find that you think very slowly, whereas when thoughts run on by themselves they flow very fast.Compare the two states: one, when our thoughts flow fast and the other when they flow slowly. For example, we are impatiently waiting for someone. We are all the time occupied with the thought—when will the person we are waiting for come? What happened to him, why isn’t he here? Has he had an accident? It seems to us we have been waiting an hour at least. We look at the watch and find it has been only five minutes.Another example. You sit in a comfortable chair. You are resting, nothing worries you. For the moment you do not want to think of anything important. Your thoughts flow slowly. It seems to you that you have been sitting thus for five minutes, whereas you sat for a whole hour.Time is our thoughts. We can measure time by our thinking. If we spend many thoughts, time seems long to us. If we spend few thoughts—time seems short. Time stands in direct ratio to the flow of associations.Just as in the thinking center, associations go on in other centers also.\nThe secret of prolonging life depends on the ability to spend the energy of our centers slowly and only intentionally. Learn to think consciously. This produces economy in the expenditure of energy. Don’t dream.Gurdjieff's Early Talks 1914-1931",

It's a novella plus a handful of short stories set before and after the novel (all available for free on Peter Watts' website).

The \"horse riding man\" is a Chinese internet meme originating from an entertainment awards ceremony, when the renowned host Tsai Kang-yong wore an elaborate outfit featuring a horse riding on his back[1]. At the time, he was embroiled in a rumor about his unpublicized homosexual partner, whose name sounded \"Ma Qi Ren\" which coincidentally translates to \"horse riding man\" in Mandarin. This incident spread widely across Chinese internet and turned into a meme. So they used \"horse riding man\" as an example isn't entirely nonsensical, though the image per se is undeniably bizarre and carries an unsettling vibe.[1] The photo of the outfit: https://share.google/mHJbchlsTNJ771yBa",

Fine dust is kicked up by vigorous activity, forming a faint grayish-brown mist in the low sky. Mid-ground, eye-level composition: A muscular, robust adult brown horse stands proudly, its forelegs heavily pressing between the shoulder blades and spine of a reclining man. Its hind legs are taut, its neck held high, its mane flying against the wind, its nostrils flared, and its eyes sharp and focused, exuding a primal sense of power. The subdued man is a white male, 30-40 years old, his face covered in dust and sweat, his short, messy dark brown hair plastered to his forehead, his thick beard slightly damp; he wears a badly worn, grey-green medieval-style robe, the fabric torn and stained with mud in several places, a thick hemp rope tied around his waist, and scratched ankle-high leather boots; his body is in a push-up position—his palms are pressed hard against the cracked, dry earth, his knuckles white, the veins in his arms bulging, his legs stretched straight back and taut, his toes digging into the ground, his entire torso trembling slightly from the weight. The background is a range of undulating grey-blue mountains, their outlines stark, their peaks hidden beneath a low-hanging, leaden-grey, cloudy sky. The thick clouds diffuse a soft, diffused light, which pours down naturally from the left front at a 45-degree angle, casting clear and voluminous shadows on the horse's belly, the back of the man's hands, and the cracked ground. The overall color scheme is strictly controlled within the earth tones: the horsehair is warm brown, the robe is a gradient of gray-green-brown, the soil is a mixture of ochre, dry yellow earth, and charcoal gray, the dust is light brownish-gray, and the sky is a transition from matte lead gray to cool gray with a faint glow at the bottom of the clouds. The image has a realistic, high-definition photographic quality, with extremely fine textures—you can see the sweat on the horse's neck, the wear and tear on the robe's warp and weft threads, the skin pores and stubble, the edges of the cracked soil, and the dust particles. The atmosphere is tense, primitive, and full of suffocating tension from a struggle of biological forces.\"\"\"",

Fine dust is kicked up by vigorous activity, forming a faint grayish-brown mist in the low sky. Mid-ground, eye-level composition: A muscular, robust adult brown horse stands proudly, its forelegs heavily pressing between the shoulder blades and spine of a reclining man. Its hind legs are taut, its neck held high, its mane flying against the wind, its nostrils flared, and its eyes sharp and focused, exuding a primal sense of power. The subdued man is a white male, 30-40 years old, his face covered in dust and sweat, his short, messy dark brown hair plastered to his forehead, his thick beard slightly damp; he wears a badly worn, grey-green medieval-style robe, the fabric torn and stained with mud in several places, a thick hemp rope tied around his waist, and scratched ankle-high leather boots; his body is in a push-up position—his palms are pressed hard against the cracked, dry earth, his knuckles white, the veins in his arms bulging, his legs stretched straight back and taut, his toes digging into the ground, his entire torso trembling slightly from the weight. The background is a range of undulating grey-blue mountains, their outlines stark, their peaks hidden beneath a low-hanging, leaden-grey, cloudy sky. The thick clouds diffuse a soft, diffused light, which pours down naturally from the left front at a 45-degree angle, casting clear and voluminous shadows on the horse's belly, the back of the man's hands, and the cracked ground. The overall color scheme is strictly controlled within the earth tones: the horsehair is warm brown, the robe is a gradient of gray-green-brown, the soil is a mixture of ochre, dry yellow earth, and charcoal gray, the dust is light brownish-gray, and the sky is a transition from matte lead gray to cool gray with a faint glow at the bottom of the clouds. The image has a realistic, high-definition photographic quality, with extremely fine textures—you can see the sweat on the horse's neck, the wear and tear on the robe's warp and weft threads, the skin pores and stubble, the edges of the cracked soil, and the dust particles.

Z-Image has been disappointing to see how it just refuses to adhere to multiple new training concepts. Maybe they tried to pack it too tightly.Open weights for this will be amazing.

For instance, an nVidia GPU is focused on providing the hardware optimizations necessary to do either LLM compute or graphics acceleration, both essentially proprietary technologies.The proprietariness isn't why it's obtuse though, you can make a chip go super-duper fast for specific tasks, or more general for all kinds of tasks. Somewhere, folks are making a tradeoff of backwards compatibility and supporting new hardware accelerated tasks.Neither of these are \"general purpose compute and data flow\" focuses.

One of my dislikes was pipelines, which is something that other people also discuss in this comment thread. Pipeline state objects are awkward to use without an extension like dynamic rendering. You get a combinatorial explosion of pipelines and usually end up storing them in a hash map.In my opinion, pipelines state objects are a leaky abstraction that exposes the way that GPUs work: namely that some state changes may require some GPUs to recompile the shader, so all of the state should be bundled together. In my opinion, an API for the web should be concerned with abstractions from the point of view of the programmer designing the application: which state logically acts as a single unit, and which state may change frequently?It seems that many modern APIs have gone with the pipeline abstraction; for example, SDL_GPU also has pipelines. I'm still not sure what the \"best practices\" are supposed to be for modern graphics programming regarding how to structure your program around pipelines.I also wish that WebGPU had push constants, so that I do not have to use a bind group for certain data such as transformation matrices.Because WebGPU is design-by-committee and must support the lowest common denominator hardware, I'm worried whether it will evolve too slowly to reflect whatever the best practices are in \"modern\" Vulkan. I hope that WebGPU could be a cross-platform API similar to Vulkan, but less verbose. However, it seems to me that by using WebGPU instead of Vulkan, you currently lose out on a lot of features.

I feel like this should be the next thing which the \"Eye of Khronos\" should focus on.All official tutorial/example code I've tried doesn't run without swapchain-sync-related validation errors on one or another configuration. Even this 'best practices' example code which demonstrates how to do the frame-loop scaffolding correctly produces valiation layer errors, so it's also quite useless:https://docs.vulkan.org/guide/latest/swapchain_semaphore_reu...What's worse: different hardware/driver combos produce different validation layer errors (even in the swapchain-code which really shouldn't have different implementations across GPU vendors - e.g. shouldn't Khronos provide common reference code for those GPU-independent parts of drivers?). I wonder if there is actually any Vulkan code out there which is completely validation-layer-clean across all possible configs (I seriously doubt it).Also the VK_[EXT/KHR]_swapchain_maintenance1 extension which is supposed to fix all those little warts has such a low coverage that it's not worth supporting (but it should really be part of the core API by now - the extension is from 2019).Anyway... baby steps into the right direction, only a shame that it took a decade ;)",

Furthermore, GPUs clearly have a hidden scheduler and this is not fully exposed by vendors. In other words we have no control over what is being run on a GPU at any given instant, we simply queue work for it.Given all these contrivances, why should not the interface exposed to the user be absolutely simple. It should then be up to vendors to produce hardware (and co-designed compilers) to run our software as fast as possible.Graphics developers need to develop a narrow-waist abstraction for wide, latency-hiding, SIMD compute. On top of this Vulkan, or OpenGL, or ML inference, or whatever can be done. The memory space should also be fully unified.This is what needs to be worked on. If you don’t agree, that’s fine, but don’t pretend that you’re not protecting entrenched interests from the likes of Microsoft, Nvidia, Epic Games, Valve and others.Telling people to just use Unreal engine, or Unity, or even Godot, it just like telling people to just use Python, or Typescript, or Go to get their sequential compute done.Expose the compute!",

It follows Vulkan 1.0, and while Vulkan is finally getting rid of most of the mess like pipelines, WebGPU went all in. It's surprisingly cumbersome to bind stuff to shaders, and everything is static and has to be hashed&cached, which sucks for streaming/LOD systems. Nowadays you can easily pass arbitrary amounts of buffers and entire scene descriptions via GPU memory pointers to OpenGL, Vulkan, CUDA, etc. with BDA and change them dynamically each frame. But not in WebGPU which does not support BDA und is unlikely to support it anytime soon.It's also disappointing that OpenGL 4.6, released in 2017, is a decade ahead of WebGPU.",

In my experience, \"text\" or \"string\" is not a type. Technically it is one, of course, but I seldom see good use of it for when a more apt type would do better -- in short, it's a last resort thing, and it fares badly there too. Ironically, the only good use for it is as input to a... parser.I see a lot of URLs being passed around as strings within a system perfectly capable of leveraging typing theory and offering user defined types, if not at least through OOP goodness a lot of people would furiously defend. The URL, in this case, would often have _already_ been parsed once, but effectively \"unparsed\" and keeps being sent around as text in need of parsing at every \"junction\" of the system that requires to meaningfully access it, except that parsing is approached like some ungodly litany best avoided and thus foregone or lazily implemented with a regex where a regex isn't nearly sufficient. Perhaps it's because we lack parsers, by and large, or in the very least parser generators that are readily available, understandable (to your average developer), and simple enough to use without requiring to understand formal language theory with Chomsky hierarchy, context sensitivity, grammar ambiguity and parse forests, to say the least.Same with [file] paths, HTTP header values, and other things that seem alluring to dismiss as only being text.It wouldn't be a problem, had I not seen time and again how the \"text\" breaks -- URLs with malformed query parameters because why not just do `+ '?' + entries.map(([ name, value ]) => name + \"=\" + value).join(\"&\")`, how hard can it be? Paths that assume leading slash or lack there of etc.I believe the article was born precisely of the same class of frustrations. So I am now bringing the same mantra everywhere with me: \"There is no such type as string\". Parse at earliest opportunity, lazily if the language allows it (most languages do) -- breadth first so as to not pay upfront, just don't let the text slip through.I am talking from experience, really, your mileage may vary.",

So you had these very convenient, very frameworky solutions that maybe looked like you were leaning on the type system but really it was all just reflection. That became the standard in every language, and nobody needed to remember “parse don’t validate” because heavy frameworks did the work. And why not? Very few error or result types in fancy typed languages are actually suited for showing multiple (internationalised) validation errors on a web page.The bitter lesson of programming languages is that whatever clever, fast, safe, low-level features a language has, someone will come along and create a more productive framework in a much worse language.Note, this framework - perhaps the very last one - is now ‘AI’.",

If you put json bytes into your parser and get back a User, then put your User through validation, that means you know there are both 'valid' Users and 'invalid' Users.Instead, there should simply be no way to construct an invalid User.  But this article pushes a little harder than that:Does your business logic require a User to have exactly one last name, and one-or-more first names?  Some people might go as far as having a private-constructor + static-factory-method create(..), which does the validation, e.g.  class User {\n    private List<String> names;\n    private User(List<String> names) {..}\n    public static User create(List<String> names) throws ValidationException {\n       // Check for name rules here\n    }\n  }\n\nEven though the create(..) method above validates the name rules, you're still left holding a plain old List-of-Strings deeper in the program when it comes time to use them.  The name rules were validated and then thrown away!  Now do you check them when you go to use them?  Maybe?If you encode your rules into your data-structure, it might look more like:  class User {\n      String lastName;\n      NeList<String> firstNames;\n      private User(List<String> names) throws ValidationException {..}\n  }\n\nIf I were doing this for real, I'd probably have some Name rules too (as opposed to a raw String).  E.g. only some non-empty collection of utf8 characters which were successfully case-folded or something.Is this overkill?  Do I wind up with too much code by being so pedantic?  Well no!  If I'm building valid types out of valid types, perhaps the overall validation logic just shrinks.  The above class could be demoted to some kind of struct/record, e.g.  record User(Name lastName, NeList<Name> firstNames);\n\nBefore I was validating Names inside User, but now I can validate Names inside Name, which seems like a win:  class Name {\n      private String value;\n      private Name (String name) throws ValidationException {..}\n  }",

Every function that takes the parsed data as an argument can ignore the possibility that the data is invalid.

The validate approach does not provide this guarantee, because you cannot guarantee that `use` is never called without first running the validation.

It is one of the better reductions of the problem: it really is “specifying behavior that should be allowed (and rejecting everything else)” vs “manually checking that everything is fine in a thousand tiny steps”, which inevitably results in missed combinations because the human brain is not designed to hold graphs that big.https://fasterthanli.me/articles/i-want-off-mr-golangs-wild-...Basically, if you do not want it to be wrapped in Option then you should either:1. explicitly specify a default—which can, but doesn't have to be 0.2. fail immediately (as this article explains) when trying to parse some data that does not have that field set.and if you do want an Option, you just need to be explicit about that.",

Anything that can be abused for DOS purposes might get abused for exactly that. If you don't like that, don't run stuff on public servers or protect them properly. Yes this is annoying and not necessarily easy. Cloud based services exist that take some of that pain away.Logs filling up with 404, 401, or 400 responses should not kill your server.

Though this is all somewhat muddied by companies that ran the former \"good\" crawlers all also being in the AI business and sometimes trying to piggyback on people having allowed or whitelisted their search crawling User-Agent, mostly this has settled a little where they're separating Googlebot from GoogleOther, facebookexternalhit from meta-externalagent, etc. This was an earlier \"wave\" of increased crawling that was obviously attributable to AI development. In some cases it's still problematic but this is generally more manageable.The other stuff, the ones that are using every User-Agent under the sun and a zillion datacenter IPs and residential IPs and rotate their requests constantly so all your naive and formerly-ok rate-based blocking is useless... that stuff is definitely being tagged as \"for AI\" on the basis of circumstantial evidence. But from the timing of when it seemed to start, the amount of traffic and addresses, I don't have any problem guessing with pretty high confidence that this is AI. To your question of \"who are the customers\"... who's got all the money in the world sloshing around at their fingertips and could use a whole bunch of scraped pages about ~everything? Call it lazy reasoning if you'd like.How much this traces back ultimately to the big familiar brand names vs. would-be upstarts, I don't know. But a lot of sites are blocking their crawlers that admit who they are, so would I be surprised to see that they're also paying some shady subcontractors for scrapes and don't particularly care about the methods?

Jerks.The hype was real though. I can still remember installing the floppy version on one of my first PCs. The first start up was like Star Trek level awe. It was so radically different and cool. Imho, Windows 95 is probably one of, if not, the most important software release of all time. Shaped how PC technology was used for the next 4 decades and still going strong.I miss the 90s where every next iteration or release of hardware/software was generally a huge improvement. Like going from a 120mb hard drive to 1.6gb disk. Or getting your first CD-ROM after only having floppies, or CD-Writer (parents bought a 1x SCSI CDR the first year consumer ones came out -- made lots of coasters). Dial up to cable internet. The feeling of experiencing those new technologies was unmatched. It created such a since of awe, inspiration and wild imagination of possibilities. I don't get that feeling much these days.",

Sometimes they don't say yes, or they aren't findable, or just aren't alive, and it's not clear who owns the rights anymore.This isn't as much of a problem with newer media, because contracts now specify what happens with new technologies, but old contracts were often limited to specific technologies.",

          "content": "It is very interesting to see completely different impressions of Feynman from comments here. As a physicist, I first got introduced to Feynman from his popular QED book as a freshman in college. Over the years, I came to admire his contributions and way of thinking but could also see the cult of personality that has formed.Feynman is definitely not like Neil deGrasse Tyson or Kaku. He was a very creative and technically sophisticated physicist. All his popular books are based on lectures he wrote and gave but they were mostly \"side projects\" e.g. computation, lectures on gravitation, six easy pieces etc.To get a better sense of his work, I would highly recommend:- The Beat of a Different Drum by Jagdish Mehra- Genius: The Life and Science of Richard Feynman by James Gleick- Selected Papers - https://www.worldscientific.com/worldscibooks/10.1142/4270 (expensive and technical)- QED and the men who made it by SchweberThere are also many historical physicists who are surprisingly unknown outside the field - Schwinger, Tomonaga, Landau, Sidney Coleman, Murray Gell-mann, Nambu, Steven Weinberg, Ken Wilson, Curtis Callan etc. I just randomly picked a few names before the 90s but these are all scientific giants. For example, Schwinger's papers are notoriously hard to read but his books are great after a first course. Sidney Coleman gave beautiful lectures on QFT. Landau is extremely famous for his 9 books with Lifshitz. It definitely is very surprising that Feynman has such an outsized share of interest. Maybe because he was a gregarious outgoing character?Another interesting aspect is how a person is often viewed as an authority or even a genius because their work introduces an audience to the subject. Feynman with his lectures. To a far lesser extent (in my opinion), one sees this with Andrej Karpathy and Jeremy Howard. This is not to take away from their wonderful teaching work. I know how hard it is to distill material and convey it. But, there's a whole web of contributions that leads to a subject maturing enough to be taught clearly.As I get older, I find it less useful to assign labels (names) to discoveries and contributions. As Feynman himself said in a lecture after drawing a Feynman diagram, \"this is THE diagram\" (and not the Feynman diagram).",

Collier doesn't claim he is. She talks about the very real contributions he made. Her criticism is largely about the way people scraped together any scrap of paper he had jotted down a note on and turned it into a thin book, \"Feynman on XYZ topic\".But yes, he does catch criticism for his very real character flaws, his grandiosity, his philandering and inappropriate workplace behavior, and his physical abuse of his wife.He was a complicated person. Much of the work discussing him is hagiography. This essay is even keeled but does not gloss over his flaws. Again, she discusses his very real contributions and legacy. It's a long essay; she makes time for the complexity of Feynman as a person.If all you want to hear about Feynman is charming stories about Tuvan throat singing, you won't enjoy this essay. That's okay; it's not for everyone. There's an instinct to reject a critical work like this on it's face. I think that does a disservice, not only to Collier, but to us as students of history.Collier is a working astrophysicist who spent months on this project. It is not a low effort hit piece. It's a critical but fair portrait from someone qualified to engage with the subject matter. I encourage everyone to withhold judgement until watching the entire essay.

The idea that nebulae are in fact whole independent collections of stars, and that the observable universe is large enough to accomodate all of that, is younger than quantum mechanics and relativity both, and only got acceptance after a huge fight. The name “Big Bang” was originally a pejorative used in a similar, later fight. And so on.

To try to find, for a given special time t, the Hamiltonian which will produce M = eⁱᴴᵗ when M is such a product of non-commuting matrices, from some simple property of the matrices themselves, appears to be very difficult.We realize, however, that at any particular time, if we expand eⁱᴴᵗ out (as 1 + iHt − H²t²⁄2 + …) we'll find the operator H operating an innumerable arbitrary number of times — once, twice, three times, and so forth — and the total state is generated by a superposition of these possibilities.

I am also a friend of Feynman's children, and several of Feynman's friends and colleagues. Now I will tell you this: Collier is a liar. The books \"Surely You're Joking, Mr. Feynman\" and \"What Do You Care What Other People Think\" were made the same way that The Feynman Lectures on Physics was made: Feynman was recorded, and the recordings were transcribed and (lightly) edited for readability. It is true for ALL of Feynman's books (also Stephen Hawking's many books, and those of some other authors) that he did not put pen to paper himself, but what is written came from him, and are not the inventions of Ralph Leighton, nor does Leighton claim authorship to them. It is another lie of Collier that the stories in Feynman's autobiographical books are \"either made up or greatly exaggerated,\" for which Collier provides no evidence whatsoever, and for which there are witnesses who claim the contrary - this is something Collier just \"made up\", because, apparently her goal in making several pejorative videos about Feynman is to defame him, for her own personal reasons. Yes it is true that Ralph Leighton is Robert Leighton's son, and Robert Leighton, who is one of Feynman's coauthors in The Feynman Lectures on Physics, was a great physicist, best known for establishing the field of microwave astronomy. But why would Ralph mention his father in Feynman's autobiographical books, when Robert Leighton is not a character in any of the stories Feynman tells in those books? What kind of criticism is that to make of Ralph? This is another example of how Collier is merely trying to smear the names of Feynman and the people associated with him. Note that Collier also says in her videos that The Feynman Lectures on Physics (the subject of this discussion) is \"not worth reading,\" which puts her at odds with almost everyone who reads it - it is, in fact, one of the most (if not THE most) popular physics books ever written, and many great physicists sing its praises. Once again, this is Collier just dissing Feynman and his works. Collier is a Feynman-hating liar who fully deserves to be ignored.",

          "content": "Feynman is indeed often quoted among the first people to propose the idea of a quantum computer! This talk he gave in ‘81 is among the earliest discussion of why a quantum universe requires a quantum computer to be simulated [1]:> Can a quantum system be probabilisticaUy simulated by a classical (probabilistic, I'd assume) universal computer? In other words, a computer which will give the same probabilities as the quantum system\ndoes. If you take the computer to be the classical kind I've described so far, (not the quantum kind described in the last section) and there're no changes in any laws, and there's no hocus-pocus, the answer is certainly, No! This is called the hidden-variable problem: it is impossible to represent the results of quantum mechanics with a classical universal device.Another unique  lecture is a 1959 one [2] about the potential of nanotechnology (not even a real thing back then). He speaks of directly manipulating atoms and building angstrom-scale engines and microscope with a highly unusual perspective, extremely fascinating for anyone curious about these things and the historical perspective. Even for Feynman’s standards, this was a unique mix of topics and terminology. For context, the structure of DNA has been discovered about 5 years prior, and the first instruments capable of atomic imaging and manipulation are from at least the 80’s.If you’re captivated by this last one as I was, I can also recommend Greg Bear’s novel “Blood Music”. It doesn’t explore the nanotechnology side much, but the main hook is biological cells as computers.

But... It's time for me to check the new Qwen 0.6 transcription model. If it works as well as their benchmarks claim, that could be the target for very serious optimizations and a no deps inference chain conceived since the start for CPU execution, not just for MPS. Since, many times, you want to install such transcription systems on server rent online via Hetzner and other similar vendors.

Well, your neighbor could probably record this information and tell how many and which people are in your home, assuming that there is enough walking to do a gait analysis. They might be able to say with some certainty if someone new comes home.That same neighbor could hide a camera and photograph your door, or sniff your WiFi and see what devices are active or run an IMSI catcher and surveil the entire neighborhood or join a corporate surveillance outfit like Ring.

For this you need to generate traffic and measure for instance RSSI or CSI (basically, signal strength) of the packets. If you increase frequency you can detect smaller movements such as arms moving vs. a body, or exclude pets if you reduce sensitivity. It works well for detecting presence and movement in a defined space, but ideally requires you to cross the path between two mains-powered devices, such as light bulbs or wifi mesh points. Passing a cafe doesn't seem too likely.If you want to do advanced sensing, trying to identify a person, I would postulate you need to saturate a space with high frequency wifi traffic, ideally placed mesh points, and let the algo train on identifying people first by a certain signature (combination of size/weight, movement/gait, breath / chest movements).Source: I worked on such technologies while at Signify (variants of this power Philips/Wiz \"SpaceSense\" feature).More here: https://www.theverge.com/2022/9/16/23355255/signify-wiz-spac...",

I am decidedly not writing this on a WiGig docking station.I dont see telcos wanting to constantly broadcast extra mmWave for little to no added benefit, especially not in all directions. Likewise, regulators are going to choke on that. And the class/band license schemes would have to be updated, to remove interference from devices already using those bands as they are about to have a constant background level of interference. E-Band PTP users, of which there are many, wont give up their high capacity links to weird 6G omni broadcasts without a fight.I tell you what however, having a button you can press that would map the environment for alignment sounds like a maybe use case here.

          "content": "> UI and user ergonomics continues to be Zulip's biggest blocker to wider adoption [...] many people who got turned away by its design or uses it in a Slack/Discord way by posting everything into \"general chat\"Having thought about this a bit, I propose there is an underlying dichotomy between \"completers\" and \"cultivators\"## CompletersPrioritize \"velocity\" and closing open loops. Limiting context means that they can act with focus. Close tabs often. Communication appends to the task queue; each conversation is an open ticket to be closed. Anything that scrolls off screen is implicitly marked as done. The ephemerality of the stream allows them to \"process\" a conversation and move on. Zulip might cause anxiety because threads/discussions linger without closure.## CultivatorsCommunication as externalized cognition. Messages are nuggets to be filed / incorporated into a larger schema. Wants a \"dashboard\" to maintain sense of control; fears something falling through the cracks more than they fear clutter. Don't care to \"finish\" a chat; want to keep the context organized and accessible for deep work / future decisions.## ProblemsZulip defaults to assuming that all chat is valuable and taxes every interaction with a little bit of up front effort. Slack assumes most chat is of ephemeral value and doesn't see the point of taxing 90% of the interactions for the 10% that might be valuable. Slack forces cultivators to become completers and Zulip nudges completors to act as cultivators.Completers preferring who prefers Slack/Discord/etc are implicitly adopting the the fragmentation of multi-system setup -- chat for ephemeral communication, and anything longer term must move to docs/wikis/Jira/whatever (which now begs for dozens of \"integrations\"). Understanding the state of anything now requires forensic archeology. (cue [Charlie Pepe Silvia meme]) Complicated acrobatics in channel names such as `#team-proj-blah` are attempts at combating the fundamental entropy of treating everything ephemeral.The challenge is that, ultimately organizing is also real work and ignoring it in a short-sighted drive for efficiency hinders longer term effectiveness.## Potential solutions?1. The chat platform could offer two different views: a triage flavored mode for completers, and a dashboard flavored mode for cultivators. Even one person could toggle back-and-forth between the two as necessary.2. Better UX for organizing incrementally, eg. UX improvements for manual clustering, and AI-assisted clustering / topic naming. Wouldn't it be great if people could continue chatting in the stream but the same message would simultaneously get filed under a topic? Technology might now enable such a product experience.3. Slack needs to stop pretending that search is an effective replacement for organization (esp when search is crappy). I haven't used Slack in a while (preferring Zulip with catchall topics as a good balance) but I get the impression that Slack [Canvas](https://slack.com/intl/en-in/features/canvas) is an attempt to combat this problem.----[Charlie Pepe Silvia meme] https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/pepe-silvia",

The basic problem is that the mobile app is, like it or not, the way most people will use the product, and it needs to be designed by an opinionated person who actually will say no to things.In my view, the home page should be just like a proper messaging app: show every recent thread (\"topic\" in Zulip nomenclature) that I'm involved in, across all my channels, with unread ones indicated using a 'dot'. Or, if you really want to be like Slack, just copy Slack more directly. In either case, the other views (Inbox, Combined Feed, DMs, etc) should be under menus, not primary actions.The other thing is that it's often hard to figure out how to reply to a topic. In the Combined Feed, which is my preferred view for consuming updates, the UX for replying sucks -- first you have to figure out to tap the headers; and even then, you can accidentally tap into a channel instead of a topic. It's extremely non obvious when you've done this and constantly causes people to reply in the wrong topic.I vibecoded some improved Inbox UX using Claude Code and I think it would be a big step up, but it's hard to know what the steps would be to get it shipped, since I don't have time to spin up properly on the codebase and I doubt my changes are acceptable as-is.

The whole thing is a security nightmare.People are setting agents up, giving them access to secrets, payment details, keys to the kingdom. Then they hook them to the internet, plugging in services and tools, with no vetting or accountability. And since that is not enough, now the put them in roleplaying sandbox, because that's what this is, and let them run wild.Prompt injections are hilariously simple. I'd say the most difficult part is to find a target that can actually deliver some value. Moltbook largely solved this problem, because these agents are relatively likely to have access to valuable things, and now you can hit many of them, at the same time.I won't even go into how wasteful this whole, social media for agents, thing is.In general, bots writing each other on mock reddit, isn't something the loose sleep over. The moment agents start sharing their embeddings, not just generated tokens online, that's the point when we should consider worrying.",

Most of the supporting evidence is quotes from various people working at AI agent companies, explaining that AI agents are not something we need to worry about.  Of course, cigarette companies told us we didn't need to worry about cigarettes either.My view is that this entire discussion around \"pattern-matching\", \"mimicking\", \"emergence\", \"hallucination\", etc. is essentially a red herring.  If I \"mimic\" a racecar driver, \"hallucinate\" a racetrack, and \"pattern-match\" to an actual race by flooring the gas on my car and zooming along at 200mph... the outcome will still be the same if my vehicle crashes.For these AIs, the \"motivation\" or \"intent\" doesn't matter.  They can engage in a roleplay and it can still cause a catastrophe.  They're just picking the next token... but the roleplay will affect which token gets picked.  Given their ability to call external tools etc., this could be a very big problem.",

I'm currently finding it works best in apps that have established patterns but aren't enormous. If you lay some groundwork (as I did, because the AI didn't exist when I started), it's quite lovely for migrating heaps of old code and just doing all those annoying little things which were never very high priority but needed fixing.If you're just starting, AI will do what you ask but it just doesn't know how to structure things in a maintainable way. So I'd argue it's still not particularly great if you \"lack coding skills\" but it might trick you into thinking so.My customers (B2B) were generally older folks. They never once asked about AI. I don't see it being a serious threat yet. People are still afraid of spreadsheets and other things I would consider quite basic, the fact that coding is more accessible than ever... I don't think that's really enticing many people. Some, sure, but why would they want to mess around with that if your product is fairly priced, does what they need, and you will maintain it for them?It's the same as us software engineers when we're deciding whether to pay for a 'managed' platform (SQL, Cloud, k8s) etc or roll our own. Sure, we can do it ourselves and for cheaper, but it just doesn't always make sense due to time and maintenance.Anyway, I'm excited for the doors this opens up for me. I was looking to hire someone a few years back the guys I brought on briefly were very mediocre and required a lot of ramp up time. And also hiring is really hard. I can get away with not hiring for much longer now because the AIs understand the project and are productive instantly. Going from zero to one employee is hard.

I continued writing about my homelab because readers who were interested in learning about homelab were also people who had a use for TinyPilot.I did the same thing when making my blogging course a few years ago.

I don't think it's the most in terms of conversion percentage, but it's the most in absolute terms because HN is so big. And then there are secondary effects of something doing well on HN because people share the link on other, smaller sites and social media.> how did you promote or otherwise let folks know about your book?The thing that's always worked best for me is writing blog posts that I hope my target audience will find interesting. So the thing that's worked for the book is adapting parts of the book to standalone blog posts and sharing those online.[0] A few of those posts did well on HN because I tried to make them interesting to developers interested in writing/blogging.[1]> What was the compelling ask to pre-order a book?Haha, maybe I should craft that more. It's mainly that they get to read more of whatever samples they've already hopefully found useful.My pitch for early access is that early readers get to read it and ask me questions and help shape the book.> And, how do you plan to publish the book?I'm already publishing it as a PDF/epub that I sell through Stripe.I might eventually do a print run or sell Amazon, but I hate dealing with Amazon and physical products, so I'd have to be really confident it would have a big impact on sales.[0] https://refactoringenglish.com/chapters/[1] https://refactoringenglish.com/tools/hn-popularity/domain/?d...",

I pay authors more, readers pay less, the ebooks are compatible with every device, and it's easier for both authors and readers to use my site than Amazon. I still probably couldn't survive against Amazon because they'd tell their authors that if they sell with me, they can't sell on Amazon.[0] They have such a market dominance that authors would lose money by using my platform, even if it's a demonstrably better product in every way with better pricing.But it goes beyond that. Big businesses have all these other huge advantages so that they can succeed not because they're offering the most value but because they have a pre-existing advantageous market position:- It's a small percentage of their costs to hire attorneys to look for tax loopholes- They can manage the overhead of abusing the H1B visa system to hire workers at below-market rates- They can sue people and get sued and still have 98% of their employees not paying attention to any lawsuits- They can afford to sell things at a loss just to choke out smaller competitorsLook at trillion dollar industries where 95% of money goes to just 2-3 companies.

It depends which models you’re looking at and what their purpose is.\nThere is substantial economic research on:\nSocial capital (e.g., Putnam, though he’s political science adjacent; economists like Glaeser formalize it)\nNetwork effects and network structure\nRepeated games and reputation\nReligious participation and club goods (Iannaccone’s work is central here)\nIdentity economics (Akerlof & Kranton)\nTrust and informal institutions\nHousehold bargaining models\nMatching theory, where who you match with specifically mattersI think the fact that communities are not fungible is frankly obvious. Fact is communities do die, and sometimes there are long run benefits to consider.The challenge is actually nurturing and valuing community which this post doesn't actually grapple with.E.g. the problem with Robert Moses wasn't just development. It was the style of development which was inherently anti-community. Nurturing a community requires common space where people bump into each other harmlessly. Highways dividing neighbourhoods, for people in their private cars to get to neighbourhoods with no commercial life and large setbacks between homes.It's not that Robert Moses didn't realize community isn't fungible. It's either that he didn't realize how bad it would be for community or that he just didn't value community in the first place.",

No wonder why so many people are befriending AIs and there's a \"loneliness epidemic\" going around.When it comes to physical communities (e.g. neighborhoods), I think about some neighborhoods in São Paulo that are being destroyed by buildings and construction sites everywhere [1]. So many neighborhoods full of stories and friendships and people who took care of each other, now becoming part of this massive verticalization, speculation and isolation. Neighbors have to leave due to construction companies' harassment. The ones that decide to stay have to live without their friends around, in neighborhoods that grow more dangerous, with worse traffic, with less small businesses and without knowing who are their new neighbors (which aren't even long term living). Their houses look exactly like Carl Fredricksen's house from Pixar's Up.When it comes to digital communities, I can only be reminded of how Orkut and MSN defined lots of adolescences in Latin America. Orkut literally had the concept of communities, where people gathered around similar interests (just as the early web's forums). I made a lot of friends in Orkut and MSN Messenger, some of them are still my friends after more than a decade. Facebook tried to recreate the idea of communities (with their groups), but Facebook is pretty much dead for younger people. And Instagram is just so isolating. It has a whole lot of standardized and algorithmically curated content that alienates you from other human beings.I believe the reason why Orkut (owned by Google) was killed was that they wanted more users, maybe to compete with Facebook. But Orkut was too localized, it basically talked to Brazil and some other countries in Latin America, and India, where it was created.

So if conservation is fundamentally impossible, what's the real goal of conservation ecology? Is it doomed to simply create \"theme parks\"? Or can we be said to meaningfully preserve something (even if it's a changed or debased form of the original). Conservation ecology is what happens when these stupid philosophical musings bump into actual engineers willing to try to do it.Human communities (even digital ones) ultimately have the character of an ecological system IMO (albeit in a more allegorical sense). What the author calls fungibility I might call conservation; weird Twitter accounts \"migrating\" to Bluesky is sort of like pandas surviving primarily in zoos. Some element of the original system is kept, but ultimately the \"conservation\" is more like \"recreation\" or \"homage\" rather than truly freezing the system in amber. Does that mean that it's futile to try? Or is there some sense in which we can have meaningful translation of the relationship web from one medium to the next? Maybe we don't even care about maintaining the system; if it's just the biodiversity we prize then maybe pandas in zoos forever is enough.I don't think this is adding anything new to what the author is saying per se, but I find the parallels interesting to muse about.",

In \"Twitter And Teargas\", Zeynep Tufecki argued that the community afforded by Twitter was unable to effect long term, substantial change and therefore Arab Spring is now a footnote. Twitter affords flash mobs.That concept - affordance - provides a hint for a model of communities. The obvious question to a hacker is \"what kind of social system would afford long term substantial change?\".Another insight is that the afforded mechanisms determine the community. This is really a restatement of the Sapir-Whorf hyptothesis. From \"your language determines what you can think\" to \"your social mechanisms determine your community\". Roughly.Another insight (corollary?) for  Sapir-Whorf is that your language prevents you from thinking some things. So one could try to understand what \"following\" as a social mechanism prevents prevents?Out of this kind of analysis emerges a different take on communities all together. For the hacker in us, John Holland's \"Hidden Order\" provides a generalized model that can be used to at least create a pseudo model for creating a simulation of the community mechanism.Although John Holland talks about Complex Adaptive Systems, I personally find \"Gestalt\" a less cumbersome and effective term. A gestalt is something greater than the sum of it's parts and that can only be true(ish) when the parts interact. So entities + rules + message bus => Gestalt. For ants this is {ants + ant behavior + pheromone trails } => ant colonies. One could conjecture that for humans this could be {people + behavior + money } => economies. Or more cynically => corporations.The complexity and emergent behavior of the {rules + message/bus part} part is probably best revealed by Wolfram's \"A New Kind of Science\".This is an incredibly important talking for our time. What is the most effective way to get rid of ants? To destroy their ability to use a pheromone trail. Perhaps we could just put advertising in it?[edit: forgot the Wolfram reference.

Maybe we should be exempting ourselves from the natural order of things and working to allow the natural course of an ecosystem to die out on its own. Then we have the ability to inhabit and change without having destroyed in the process.Idk, additional things to muse on.",

Perhaps we could just put advertising in it?I'm taking this analogy for myself :)> what kind of social system would afford long term substantial change?In my experience over the last year, these things are true...First, in-person interaction is strictly better than digital. You can meet lots of people digitally and talk to them in bed, but _interacting_ with a given person face-to-face means you can do any digital interaction, plus have very high-bandwidth communication, and also share papers. (I love paper. It's not obsolete if you know what a Pareto frontier is.) This is something that many people understand intuitively but it took me a while to quantify it.Second, digital (text) communication affords bickering. In the best case, if I'm DMing a friend and we disagree about some political point, it will make the conversation awkward. If I'm in a big group chat, it can drag people into a dogpile. It's an emotional drain and nobody really likes it. And it doesn't happen nearly as much in person. Even with the exact same people. Even I am nicer and more patient in person. And being able to physically leave and see someone later is a nice option that digital spaces (even Signal) don't afford. They only understand permanent blocks and not just \"Tell me your dumb take another time.\"Third, you can just say \"I'm trying to build community and make friends, can I introduce you to some people you might like?\" and in the right context and framing, it can sort of work. I am still learning this skill.Fourth, and I almost forgot - A _huge_ amount of nonverbal communication comes down to trust and respect, especially respecting other people's time. Did you call a 50-person meeting where 1 person is yammering about some bikeshed bullshit? Everyone hates that. Are you talking to someone one-on-one but they still won't give you a turn or ask you anything about yourself? They might be a good person but they're gonna be hard to get along with if they keep that up. Did you send someone a blog post that takes 5 minutes to read? And they didn't ask for it? They aren't gonna read it. I wouldn't read it. You would have more luck reading it out loud to them in person because it shows that you are both respecting each other's time. Otherwise you are assigning homework and asking their attention without paying your attention to them. I can't name a person who likes that.",

This was a claim by some earlier linguists pre-World War II since then it has fallen out of acceptance by contemporary linguists.

I can't think of anybody that got lost, and it was actually an improvement because the new discussion infrastructure was better than it had been before. The community didn't scatter to the winds, far from it; it consolidated and grew.Of course, such a situation is probably rarer with the enshittification these days, but it would be worth it to figure out when it works, too.And history is replete with stories of groups who became most successful AFTER a migration, or at least were not so negatively affected by one.",

I find it ironic that online communities thrived on the detachment between the virtual persona that posts are associated to and the real persona that is writing the posts, but for one reason or another some people insist in connecting both.It's a \"need to know\" basis, and I don't need to know your face, I don't need to know your gender, your age, where you are from, what job you have, I don't need to know your political affiliation, your religion, your other hobbies, what movies you watched, games you played, books you read, whom you follow, what communities you have joined. I don't need to know anything more than what the words in the post say.When you \"need\" to know what is real you end up with social media like \"BeReal\" which is just an enormous privacy nightmare (requiring you to take photos at random times) just to make sure that people aren't editing photos or showing only the good aspects of their lives to the internet.
