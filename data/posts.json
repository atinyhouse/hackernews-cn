      "abstract": "该讨论围绕用户因创建Claude.md文件被Anthropic封禁的事件展开，核心争议在于AI公司封禁政策的透明度与合理性。多数用户对Anthropic缺乏人工支持、封禁理由模糊表示不满，有人认为封禁可能源于自动化系统误判正常使用行为（如调用API或工具集成），也有用户指出类似情况在OpenAI等平台同样存在，体现AI服务商对用户行为的监控边界问题。讨论中提到，部分用户尝试通过欧洲数据保护法规争取申诉权，但普遍共识认为当前AI公司的封禁机制缺乏有效沟通渠道，容易损害付费用户权益。分歧点在于是否应接受AI公司为维护系统稳定性采取严格管控，但整体情绪倾向于批评企业单方面执行封禁且不提供明确解释的做法。",

          "content": "I've been doing something a lot like this, using a claude-desktop instance attached to my personal mcp server to spawn claude-code worker nodes for things, and for a month or two now it's been working great using the main desktop chat as a project manager of sorts. I even started paying for MAX plan as I've been using it effectively to write software now (I am NOT a developer).Lately it's gotten entirely flaky, where chat's will just stop working, simply ignoring new prompots, and otherwise go unresponsive. I wondered if maybe I'm pissing them off somehow like the author of this article did.Now even worse is Claude seemingly has no real support channel. You get their AI bot, and that's about it. Eventually it will offer to put you through to a human, and then tell you that don't wait for them, they'll contact you via email. That email never comes after several attempts.I'm assuming at this point any real support is all smoke and mirrors, meaning I'm paying for a service now that has become almost unusable, with absolutely NO means of support to fix it. I guess for all the cool tech, customer support is something they have not figured out.I love Claude as it's an amazing tool, but when it starts to implode on itself that you actually require some out-of-box support, there is NONE to be had. Grok seems the only real alternative, and over my dead body would I use anything from \"him\".",

And that made me sad, but not for reasons that you expect.Out of all of the tech organizations, frontier labs are the one org you'd expect to be trying out cutting edge forms of support. Out of all of the different things these agents can do, surely most forms of \"routine\" customer support are the lowest hanging fruit?I think it's possible for Anthropic to make the kind of experience that delights customers. Service that feels magical. Claude is such an incredible breakthrough, and I would be very interested in seeing what Anthropic can do with Claude let loose.I also think it's essential for the anthropic platform in the long-run. And not just in the obvious ways (customer loyalty etc). I don't know if anyone has brought this up at Anthropic, but it's such a huge risk for Anthropic's long-term strategic position. They're begging corporate decision makers to ask  the question, \"If Anthropic doesn't trust Claude to run its support, then why should we?\"",

Similar to the OP I don't find I am doing anything particularly weird, but if their use case wasn't looked upon favorably by Anthropic, mine probably won't be either.After the OpenCode drama where some people got banned for using it I saw some people from Anthropic on Twitter asking folks to DM them if they got banned and they'd get unbanned.

I find I get good answers from it when it does work, but it's getting very annoying to use.(on the flip side, Codex seems like it's being SO efficient with the tokens it can be hard to understand its answers sometimes, it rarely includes files without you doing it manually, and often takes quite a few attempts to get the right answer because it's so strict what it's doing each iteration. But I never run out of quota!)",

Tried general software design questions, asking about problems he solved, his preferences on the way of working, consistently felt like he didn't have much to argue, if he did at all.Long story short, I sent a feedback email the day later saying that we had issues evaluating him properly, suggested to trim his CV with topics he liked more to talk about instead of risking being asked about stuff he no longer remembered much. And finally I suggested to always come prepared with insights of software or human problems he solved as they can tell a lot about how he works because it's a very common question in pretty much all interview processes.God forbid, he threw the biggest tantrum on a career subreddit and linkedin, cherrypicking some of my sentences and accusing my company and me to be looking for the impossible candidate, that we were looking for a team and not a developer, and yada yada yada.

The new phone now seems to think it has two physical SIM slots: it shows an IMEI2 in About, but any attempt to use the eSIM functionality just fails (scanning a code does \"nothing\"; no \"add\" button is visible, etc.).If this was an Android phone, I'd root it and just fix the offending network configuration file.

A button you press that gives money to apple, in response you receive some sort of lovely bauble with no actual functionality.  The cost to apple to maintain this would be quite small (they could probably survive with 10 engineers focused mainly on site reliability) and given the historical pattern of Apple customers (I am one), would be highly profitable.",

Fortunately, radio & media do work. But product managers wouldn't have been product managers without spoiling something. Somebody decided the alarm and night mode must work together in unison, and also they dropped the turn-off-for-30-min feature, and they decided to make night mode smart, that it doesn't turn on if the phone was active at the time. So, now you can get spam calls or sms make it ring loudly at night, because night mode didn't turn on, because you used the phone. Next time when you notice night mode should be on, but isn't, you turn it on. But now it's permanent -- till the end of the universe, unless you turn it off.

It never came. There was an email alternative, but that also didn't work properly (maybe only on certain devices, IIRC?). Apparently in the settings you can request a 2FA code, though, so I did that... but that only had five digits, whereas I needed to give six for the code to work. Eventually I figured out that Apple had just forgotten to zero-pad the 2FA code out to six digits, so I needed to add a leading zero to make things work.The worst part of this is that now my Apple TV account is linked to a laptop that I don't always have on me. And even if I did have it on me, I don't want to get a laptop out and turn it on just to do 2FA. I already have a TOTP app on my phone, just let me put everything in there and leave me be.My experience with MacOS is generally that it's about as buggy as my home Linux setup.

But in practice, Android doesn't need to upgrade the OS to access recent apps and ship security updates for old versions of Android. You just lose access to new OS functionalities, but it has been a while since there was much to care about.",

He bungled his last case so badly it made national news. In an American police procedural, we would either have some mitigating explanation for his failure, or at least some gritty vice or personal demon that was the real reason he got demoted.In Broadchurch, Tennant's character just sucks at his job. Every episode of the show conforms to a formula where he gets suspicious of one of the other characters in the show and we spend the episode wasting time while it's finally determined that the suspect of the week is actually innocent. I have to say, it makes for entertaining television. It also resulted in my wife and I chorusing aloud, every episode, \"he's SO BAD at his job!!\"(Minor Broadchurch spoilers) At the end when he finally catches the big bad, it's not because of anything he did. A coincidence and some carelessness on the part of the big bad lead to the mystery being solved. Also, every other character on the show had already been ruled out.Since watching it we've kept a lookout for protagonists who embody the \"everyman in way over his head who accomplished virtually nothing himself\" archetype.

I recall Tennant arguing at various points that it's probably the more obvious suspect/explanation. It's the whole you're probably hearing horses not zebras thing. Which in reality is the more competent approach. Crimes usually are committed by the most obvious suspect and pursuing more obscure theories is a worse approach.But of course in a TV universe that's completely flipped on its head, nobody makes shows about normal straightforward cases.This same conflict bugged me about the movie Zero Dark Thirty. The main analyst is 1000% sure that her hunch is correct and is constantly aggressively adamant about it, despite a lack of hard evidence. The others analysts are shown being much more rational, giving probabilities to their assessments and grounding conclusions in evidence. But since it's a movie of course you know the heroine is going to be correct and all of the other people seems like indecisive fools. But in reality someone who acted like her would be an absolute train wreck and the sober rational ones would be getting things done consistently with far fewer screw ups.",

This makes them lovable: we appreciate them for this quality that we (most of the audience) do not have.[1]: (or lack of self-awareness, in some other cases mentioned here like Homer Simpson or Peter Griffin)Arthur Dent, on the other hand, is not gifted with undying optimism. He's constantly moaning about things, starting with his house and his planet being destroyed. This makes him relatable more than lovable: he's not a “lovable loser” (and for the right audience, does not seem a “loser” at all), he is just us, “my kind of guy” — we feel kinship rather than appreciation. We relate to the moaning (if Arthur Dent were to remain unfailingly optimistic, he'd be… different), whereas if Charlie Brown were to lose his optimism or if Homer were to say \"D'oh!\" to complain about big things in life rather than hurting his thumb or whatever, they would become less of the endearing American institutions they are IMO.",

Superman could do literally anything and instead chooses to save lives. Saitama is basically bored and saves lives sort of by accident.It's hard to write good superman stories because there's only so many times you can have lois lane tied to some railroad tracks or kryptonite show up again, but the good stories have superman struggling with moral choices and unknown consequences.Now that I type this out, it seems like most superman movies are pretty constrained by their budget from being able to focus on smaller scale stuff. Basically, if you're making a superman movie, you've gotta have skyscrapers falling over at somepoint.Anyways, in conclusion: everyone should watch Superman: The Animated Series (and related spinoffs).

The difference in sales success is down to the fact that JKR got a better US publisher. Scholastic has an unfair advantage in the young adult and graded reader markets called the \"Scholastic Book Fair\". Basically, it's a travelling bookstore event set up in US schools where they sell kids books. If you wanted to start a YA phenomenon in the US, especially back in the 2000s, that was the perfect way to do it.For similar reasons, Bone outsold a good chunk of other western comics purely because of the fact that Scholastic was the only company willing to touch it.Another factor is that its obvious Britishisms come across as fantastical to American audiences. I mean, who in America even knows what a boarding school is? This is the same reason why Naruto did so well in America, even though most of the things that seem unique about its world are just fantastic versions of bog-standard ninja tropes.[0] This is the same reason why Naruto arguably did better in America than in its native Japan.",

I had a very difficult time finding most British humor funny when I was younger, but my personality combination of loving humor and comedy and also being incredibly interested in people, drove me to want to understand why British humor was funny when most of the time it just seemed so absurd.It was a multi-decade path so it's very difficult to identify progression points, but slowly through exposure I began to \"get it\" and now I adore British comedy and humor. I still adore American comedy and humor as well, but the more exposure to the culture I got, the more I understood it.Obviously that's just anecdotal, but I personally find it strong evidence that the humor divide is indeed cultural. The more similar cultures are to begin with, the easier the leap is.To me the most exciting part of this is that it means there are thousands of other cultures on this planet that have humor that I have not unlocked yet. Someday I hope to!Edit: for a very fascinating example of differences, I love comparing the UK version of the office to the US version of the office. To many Americans, David Brent mostly just came off mean and an asshole, even a poisonous one, whereas Michael Scott comes off as eccentric and clueless and unable to read the room, but overall a mostly good guy. That perception makes David Brent kind of hateable whereas Michael Scott kind of lovable.Another fascinating point of comparison is the UK version of ghosts, versus the US version of ghosts.

Versus the focus on escapism in even the most grim US television - i.e.: Tony Soprano is a monster, but he also has charisma and glamour. Walter White is dying and becoming more and more amoral, but he also goes from being a dork to a badass. Both characters are utter glamorisations of what their real life counterparts would be like. Along with the surrealism there's a genuine existentialism to the darkest of UK comedy - from early Alan Partridge to Nighty Night. An actual interest in examining the nature of cruelty and suffering.",

No-one is sad when they're gone, life moves on.I would also say that the Always Sunny gang really aren't sympathetic either, but it's a para-social trick of having spent so much time \"together\" with them over so many episodes.I suspect a new viewer coming to watch the latest series of IASIP would not see them as sympathetic. That's quite different to The Office (US), where a new viewer skipping to later seasons would not have the same opinions as a new viewer watching season 1, where Scott was much closer to a Brent type character, before he was redeemed and made more pitiable than awful over the seasons.",

At the beginning of the series the concept for all male and female characters started out really interesting. But the female characters barely got any development compared to the male ones, and it got worse as the series went on. Partially because it ended up focusing more and more on Naruto and Sasuke, partially because the majority of the female character development was reduced to how they relate to the male characters.I don't think it's intentional or that Kishi has any malice towards women or anything - if that was the case I doubt he would have been able to come up with interesting character concepts for women in the first place.

Journalists love the \"Microsoft gave\" framing because it makes Microsoft sound like they're handing these out because they like the cops, but that's not how it works. If your company has data that the police want and they can get a warrant, you have no choice but to give it to them.This makes the privacy purists angry, but in my opinion it's the reasonable default for the average computer user.

The sanctions were introduced after the court issued an arrest warrant for Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu.The concrete consequences of the sanctions extend far beyond a travel ban to the US. \"The sanctions affect all aspects of my daily life. They prohibit all US individuals or legal entities, all persons or companies, including their foreign subsidiaries, from providing me with services\", Guillou explains.All his accounts with US companies such as Amazon, Airbnb, PayPal, and others have been closed. \"For example, I booked a hotel in France through Expedia, and a few hours later, the company sent an email canceling the reservation citing the sanctions. In practice, you can no longer shop online because you don't know if the packaging your product comes in is American. Being under sanctions is like being sent back to the 1990s\", he says.\"Overnight, you find yourself without a bank card, and these companies have an almost complete monopoly, at least in Europe. US companies are actively involved in intimidating sanctioned individuals – in this case, the judges and prosecutors who administer justice in contemporary armed conflicts\", he notes.He emphasizes that sanctions can last for more than a decade or even longer.https://nordictimes.com/world/how-french-icc-judge-faces-us-...",

In practice though, software is distributed outside of the EU and while GPL relies on local laws to \"maximize\" its copyleftness, EUPL specifically refers to either the EU country of the developer or Belgium if the developers from outside the EU, where the laws do not distinguish between static or dynamic linking (check \"More details on the case of linking\" from [0] about license compatibility). Also FWIW while FSF suggests that \"license hopping\" (i.e. changing to some compatible licenses from EUPL to something else) weakens the copyleft, a European Commision lawyer who worked on EUPL has commented doing so would be copyright infringement because the purpose of the compatibility list in EUPL is for interoperability (so that multiple projects with different licenses can coexist) and the purpose would matter in court.Though in practice since software is often distributed outside of EU, e.g. to US where (it seems) such distinction does exist, people do respect (L)GPL's dynamic vs static linking requirements and from a worldwide perspective EUPL is something like LGPL with a dash of AGPL (making some program functionality available even remotely is considered as distribution).

I use a custom domain.Turns out that there are two competing features, not-at-all documented. If you use a catch-all, like I do, AND use specific addresses for sending, the two are incompatible to some degree. Which is bonkers.Example: with a catchall I can create any address I want (and I do). Some store wants an email for a big discount, cool, here's a throwaway. Buying something online, here's a throwaway.Now sometimes, I need to reply using that throwaway. Turns out in Proton, this triggers a gotcha. As soon as I add the throwaway email to my list of email addresses for sending, I enter a world with a limit of 10 max.That's fine, I can disable them right?Nope, it turns out if I disable them in order to add aothers, Proton blocks those addresses *even though I have a catch-all*. WHAT?? Worse, if I try to delete the addresses, Proton will also delete the associated messages in my Inbox/folders. Excuse me?2. What really pushed me away: Search.Whatever proton is using under the hood is easily the worst search experience I've ever had from a mail product, and I use Thunderbird on my work machine.Notable: Proton Bridge. I get why, but it's just terrible.So many rough edges. Just not worth it.",

          "content": "It's a desperate attempt at staying relevant, even if most of those companies don't realize it yet. Because of its general-purpose nature, AI subsumes products. Most software products that try to \"implement AI in every corner\" would, from the user's POV, be more useful if they became tools for ChatGPT/Claude/Gemini.People's goals are rarely limited to just one software product, and products are basically defined as a bag of tools glued with UI, that work together but don't interoperate much with anything else. That boundary drawn around a bunch of software utilities, is given a name and a fancy logo, and sold or used to charge people rent. That's software products. But LLMs want to flip that around - they're good at gluing things, so embedding one within a product is just a waste of model capabilities, and actually makes the product boundary more apparent and annoying.Or in short: consider Copilot in Microsoft Word, vs. \"Generate Word Document\" plugin/tool for a general LLM interface (whether Gemini webapp or Claude Code or something like TypingMind). The former is just an LLM locked in a box, barely able to output some text without refusing or claiming it can't do it. The latter is a general-purpose tool that can search the web for you, scrap some sites and run data analysis on results (writing its own code for this), talk results over with you, cross-reference with other sources, and then generate you a pretty Word document with formatting and images.This is, btw., a real example. I used a Word document generator with TypingMind and GPT-4 via API, and it was more usable over a year ago than Copilot is even now. Partly because Copilot is just broken, but mostly because the LLM can do lots of things other than writing text in Word.Point being, AI is eroding the notion of software product as something you sell/rent, which threatens just about the entire software industry :).",

These small unix tools allowed the greater ecosystem to just cobble together what they wanted without too much hassle. I've done exactly this!This is the exact mindset that keeps people away. They'd prefer to NOT maintain their own video recording software THANK YOU VERY MUCH. So you get people who go to Mac OS because there's always a slick solution for a couple bucks and you never have to be TOO fiddly.This doesn't destroy the market for people in the latter camp, but it DOES open up the market for people in the former.",

Their biggest advantage is that people don't like change, and thus having to e.g. export data from some tools etc. seems to be a hassle not worth $5 a month.\nBut as the models get better and the quality of the output will match the quality of the established SaaS but tailor the whole thing to a single user with the ability to make any change they can imagine within minutes, and perhaps deploy to Hetzner and whatnot where they could host all of those apps for a single $5 instead, the exodus will accelerate.On the other hand, new products will have a much harder time to gather a big userbase. Whenever I'll see a launch of a SaaS asking for $$$, the first question I'll ask myself will be how long it will take LLM to recreate it. And for most cases, I imagine that the time it will take to get 80% of what they have is a few vibe coding sessions (as most newcomers will probably have used LLM themselves to code it up).",

The average computer user does not even use a computer as their primary computing device, they use a phone. The barrier to going from idea to phone app on iPhone or Android is relatively high.Todo list apps, habit trackers, and the like are almost a special snowflake breed. Almost everyone has some different cross-section of needs they care about, and no app is perfect for each individual. So it's natural to say \"is there something that matches what I want?\" and then reach for tools to make that. The world is your oyster for todo list apps. Of course, the real issue comes from data sovereignty, trust, quality, things like that. When Apple launches a new device or a new iOS feature people want, you get to see which apps will actually implement the new features or which stagnate.

They can stop making feature updates, but if they turn off the servers, the service ends. They still have costs even if you use the software less. You can argue about the profit margins, but that's not the point here. As most SaaS companies don't start with on-premises, they can't ever get their software working there for many reasons.

I wonder if this has to do with eBay's search ranking algorithm or some other irrational behavior that I don't understand. At any rate, bidding with 5 or less seconds left to go seems to defeat the above behaviors. I find it distasteful and irrational but it works so I put up with it.eBay's reputation and trust network is really what makes it a viable product at this point.

This is a marked difference from the expectation that, like a real-world in-person auction, the extending deadline might encourage further spur-of-the-moment bidding.Whether it makes much difference to the final price or not is immaterial though if the buyers believe that it does. This is one of the (several) reasons why eBay won out against similar competition in the early days: buyers felt they were getting a better deal by being able to snipe so favoured eBay with more of their attention and this brought more sellers to the platform (which attracted more buyers, and so on round the loop). It is telling that to deal with the extra load imposed on the system by external bots refreshing pages and putting in automated bids, instead of switching to an extending auction model they implemented what is almost a built-in sniping feature.Auction sites have to be very careful (or just very lucky) in their messaging, to convince both sellers and buyers that they are getting a good deal - any major change to how eBay works could upset the balance that they currently have in that regard and start a flood in the other direction (the more people leave, the more other people will think about leaving) to the building toward critical mass that was how they won out in those early days.",

Then, you would enable automatic mode, and it would automatically bid/buy any item that someone put up for sale if the price was much lower than normal.You would leave it running overnight, or whatever, then come back to go pick up all the items it bought, and then you would go back to the auction house and sell all your items you bought at the correct price.Basically, you would see buy auctions created by people who didn’t realize what the correct price should be and sold too cheaply. Since this was an automated system, you could beat any human to take advantage of the deal.I made a ton of in game currency doing this.After a few months they changed the auction rules to prevent this… add-ons could no longer directly bid on items, and you had to sit there and click “buy” whenever the script found a good deal.

It does, in fact, work much better. There is still an advantage to bidding very late: there is no disadvantage, and it lowers bids in cases of irrational or imperfect opposing bidders.

Timing attacks are (in part) a privacy concern, and privacy is a security concern, yes, but security is not just privacy concern, and privacy concerns are not just about timing attacks; these groups are not equal. For example, they might very well want the transmitted keypresses themselves to remain confidential, or they might very well want to retain cryptographic assurance of their integrity. These are security features they can continue to utilize by sticking with SSH.All of this is to say, it's not even necessarily them using SSH for a hypothetical #2 or #3 (...etc...) reason, but likely because they still very much want to make use of large chunks of #1, which disabling keypress obfuscation does not actually rid SSH of, only at most weakens it in ways they clearly seem to be okay with.(*) although if I zoom out enough, this is once again just \"a primary is not a totality\", just implicitly",

Wasn't sure if I could do this with ssh\n  * When I started investigating this, I didn't remotely think that ssh was the root cause.

The time at which I would have read the SSH spec was after I captured traffic from a regular SSH session and observed the same pattern; before that I was thinking about the problem wrong.I don't think that this is unfortunate. In fact, I think I got what I wanted here (a better sense of Claude Code's strengths and weaknesses). You're right that an alternative approach would have taught me different things, and that's a worthy goal too.[1] I suspect this is because I was doing it for an old job and I had to figure out how to run some application with keys I controlled?

I have heard modern cores can do ~40-50 Gbps, but I have not been able to find any independent benchmarks of that. Even the Intel i5-2500, a CPU from 2011, averages ~10 Gbps which is ~20x that rate. Even unaccelerated encryption can do ~2-5 Gbps in pure software which is 4-10x the SSH rate.And in this situation, the amount of encrypted payload in each packet is 36 bytes which is ~40x less than a full packet of ~1500 bytes. You would almost surely hit packet per second limits before you hit payload throughput limits at these small sizes.Encryption is slow when compared to data throughput you can get with a properly designed transport stack, but that is because it is in comparison to 100 Gbps per core even with no hardware offload. Anything less than ~10 Gbps/1 million packets per second (ignoring other bottlenecks, so only the software transport is the limit) is not merely unoptimized, it is pessimized.[1] https://calomel.org/aesni_ssl_performance.html",

The amount of data sent on each clock pulse also tells you something about what was sent.The Chaff packets already fire on a timer. They inject random extra fake keystrokes so you can't tell how many keystrokes were actually made. The only other way I can think of to solve that is by using a step function: Send one larger packet (fragmented or the same number of individual packets) on each clock pulse if the actual data is less than some N where N is the maximum keystrokes ever recorded with some margin. Effectively almost every clock pulse will be one packet (or set of packets) of identical size.

      "abstract": "该讨论围绕Capital One以51.5亿美元收购金融科技公司Brex的新闻展开。核心话题是此次收购对Brex及其用户、投资者和市场竞争格局的影响。\n\n社区观点呈现多元。有用户指出Brex在2022年曾突然终止对中小企业的服务，转向企业市场，引发对其客户策略的批评。关于收购价格，讨论中提到Brex估值从2021年的123亿美元峰值大幅下降，但仍有用户认为在当前市场环境下，这已是相当不错的交易结果，早期投资者和创始人获利颇丰。对于行业影响，有人认为这为过度炒作的金融科技估值提供了现实基准，并以竞争对手Ramp的高估值作对比，质疑其实际价值。同时，也有用户关注收购方Capital One通过连续收购正成为金融巨头，而Brex则因面临Mercury和Ramp的竞争压力，此次出售被视为一个良好出路。\n\n共识在于多数用户认为Brex出售价格虽低于峰值，但仍属成功退出。主要分歧体现在对Brex过往客户策略的评价，以及对金融科技公司真实价值的判断上。",

The guy who literally told us this framed it as a good thing for us like it was some sort of weird break up.At the time we had signed a large enterprise agreement not long before that, and we even were advertised as a enterprise customer testimonial. When we mentioned that he said it was final. They ghosted us apparently and from what i heard a bunch of companies were the same somehow no longer acceptable for their services.

Even with auto balance shifting rules, I've had a few transactions fail because of bad timing.

Sounds like a win.The liquidation waterfall:Venture capitalists get their liquidation preference first: $10 million.Legal fees and transaction costs: $2 million.Retention bonuses for engineers: $2.5 million.Founder compensation: $500,000 vesting over 3 years.Early employees who built everything: $0.The $15 million exit becomes:Investors made whole.Lawyers paid.The acquirer got talent locked for 4 years.The founder got $500K spread over 3 years.Employees got nothing.In a real exit, liquidation preferences get worse with multiple rounds.Series A investors: 1 times preference on $5 million.Series B investors: 1.5 times preference on $15 million.Series C investors: 2 times participating preferred on $40 million.The company sells for $100 million.Series C gets $80 million for their preference. Plus 30% of the remaining $20 million. Total: $86 million.Series B wants $22.5 million. But only $14 million remains after Series C.Series A gets $0.Founders get $0.Employees get $0.The company sold for $100 million.Late investors took it all.That’s liquidation preferences.The structure venture capitalists use to ensure they extract regardless of the outcome.Build a $50 million company?Liquidation preferences eat it.Build a $100 million company?Liquidation preferences eat it.Build a $500 million company?Finally, maybe founders see something.But most companies never reach $500 million.So most founders never see anything.The preference isn’t protection.It’s extraction by design.Real-world example: Brex.On January 22, 2026, Capital One announced the acquisition of Brex for $5.15 billion.Brex was last valued at $12.3 billion in 2022.58% down round.$7.15 billion vanished.But the real damage happens in distribution.Brex raised hundreds of millions across multiple rounds.Late-stage investors who invested at the peak $12.3 billion valuation have senior liquidation preferences.The waterfall likely looks like:Series D/E investors: 1 to 2 times preference on $300+ million.Series C investors: 1 times preference on prior rounds.Series A/B investors: 1 times preference on early rounds.Total preferences could easily exceed $3 to 4 billion.Leaving $1 to 2 billion for common stockholders.Founders and employees hold common stock.After 8 years building a company “worth” $12.3 billion that sold for $5.15 billion, the founders might walk away with a fraction of what they expected.Or nothing at all.Meanwhile:Pedro Franceschi, co-founder and CEO, gets to keep working... for Capital One now.Venture capitalists get their preferences paid.Capital One gets the business.Build a $12 billion company. Sell for $5 billion. Watch preferences eat everything.The founders who built it get whatever’s left after investors take their cut.That’s liquidation preferences in the real world.Not hypothetical.Happening right now.But wait...Won’t founder Pedro be fine?Probably better than employees, yes.Here’s the extraction hierarchy:Capital One negotiates a management retention pool.Pedro gets carved out before liquidation preferences hit.Part of his payout comes as a retention bonus, not equity distribution.He likely sold shares during secondary markets at peak valuation.Translation: Pedro probably walks away with low 8-figures plus a retention package.Not zero.But nowhere near “co-founder of $12 billion company” money.Who gets destroyed:Early employees with common stock options: $0.Mid-stage employees who joined at $5 to 8 billion valuation: $0.Late employees who joined at $12.3 billion valuation: negative. Underwater options.Engineers who turned down Google... $300K salary plus $500K stock.For Brex... $180K plus equity “worth millions”.Just lost everything.The real extraction:Pedro built an independent fintech company.Raised billions.Hired hundreds.Served thousands of customers.Now he’s a Capital One employee for the next 3 to 5 years.Can’t leave. Retention package clawback.Can’t compete. Non-compete clause.Can’t build independently. Golden handcuffs locked.He traded “founder of Brex” for “division president at Capital One.”The money he gets is real. The freedom he loses is worth more.The pyramid:Top: Late-stage investors. Get preferences, exit clean.Middle: Founder/CEO. Gets some payout, loses independence.Bottom: Employees. Get nothing, lose jobs, or become Capital One workers.Liquidation preferences don’t just determine money.They determine who keeps their freedom.Investors: always free to move to the next deal.Founder: locked into the acquirer for years.Employees: lucky to have a job offer.Pedro won’t starve.But he’s not independent anymore.That’s the extraction that doesn’t show up in the press release.",

This is a hard market to make work, particularly since developers are very famous for not paying for tooling, but they appear to making a profit.With Docker Hub, it's always been a challenge to limit how much that costs to run. And with more stuff being thrown in larger images, I don't want to see that monthly bill. The limits they added hurt, but also made a lot of people realize they should have been running their own mirror on-prem, if not only to better handle an upstream outage when us-east-1 has a bad day.Everything else has been pushing into each of the various popular development markets, from AI, to offloading builds to the cloud, to Hardened Images. They release things for free when they need to keep up with the competition, and charge when enterprises will pay for it.They've shifted their focus a lot over the years. My fear would be if they stayed stagnant, trying to extract rents without pushing into new offerings.

          "content": "You just plug Nix into a service manager that you have Nix bring along for you. Many years ago, I did this for a proof-of-concept at work with supervisord[1] and flake.nix. Devenv[2] builds in[3] support for process-compose[4], which GP mentioned. A few years ago, one long-time Nixer even created[5] a framework, nix-processmgmt[6] that abstracts over various service managers including supervisord and s6[7], which can both be used in a self-contained way regardless of the init system on the host.There are a ton of other open-source process supervisors you can use to manage long-lived processes in a portable way, too, notably Foreman[8] and various clones written in languages other than JS, and GNU Shepherd[9]. In the course of writing this post, I discovered one called dinit[10] which looks sort of similar to s6 and the GNU Shepherd in that it supports both pure usermode operation as well as functioning as an OS's init system. Anyway, all of 'em are in Nixpkgs, so you can pick them up and use them without any packaging work, too.Service orchestration and containers are basically orthogonal concerns. Before Docker was born, there were already plenty of portable tools for standalone \"process supervision\", \"service management\", whatever you wanna call it. So it is after Docker, as well.If I needed this for one of my dev environments I would take a look at process-compose to decide if it's acceptable to me. If it isn't, then after surveying the contemporary landscape of usermode service managers, I'd then write a devenv module that generates configs for it, and use that.> Should I run Nix in Docker, Docker from Nix, or is there a nix-only solution for this?I'd do this in a \"Nix-only\" way if possible, but if it's convenient for you to run a service via Docker (or Podman or any other container runtime), you can still do that.If you can safely assume that all of your devs have it available, you can ship the client (`docker` or `podman` CLI or whatever) as part of your Nix environment, then have your process manager launch it via that command line interface. I'd avoid running Nix from within Docker for the purposes of development environments.--1: https://supervisord.org/2: https://devenv.sh/3: https://devenv.sh/supported-process-managers/process-compose...4: https://f1bonacc1.github.io/process-compose/5: https://sandervanderburg.blogspot.com/2020/02/a-declarative-...6: https://github.com/svanderburg/nix-processmgmt7: https://skarnet.org/software/s6/8: https://github.com/ddollar/foreman9: https://shepherding.services/10: https://davmac.org/projects/dinit/",

We couldn't offer that (although we tried in the early days) so it made sense that they would.In the early days we tried very hard to accommodate their needs, for example by implementing support for devicemapper as an alternative to aufs. I remember spending many hours in their Boston office whiteboarding solutions. But we soon realized our priorities were fundamentally at odds: they cared most about platform lock-in, and we cared most about platform independence. There was also a cultural issue: when Red Hat contributes to open source it's always from a position of strength. If a project is important to them, they need merge authority - they simply don't know how to meaningfully contribute to an upstream project when they're not in charge. Because of the diverging design priorities, they never earned true merge rights on the repo: they had to argue for their pull requests like everyone else, and input from maintainers was not optional. Many pull requests were never merged because of fundamental design issues, like breaking compatibility with non-Red Hat platforms. Others because of subjective architecture disagreements. They really didn't like that,  which led to all sorts of drama and bad behavior. In the process I lost respect for a company I once admired.I also think they made a mistake marketing podman as a drop-in replacement to Docker. This promise of compatibility limited their design freedom and I'm sure caused the maintainers a lot of headaches- compatibility is hard!Ultimately the true priority of podman - native integration with the Red Hat platform - makes it impossible for it to overtake Docker. I'm sure some of the podman authors would like to jettison that constraint, but I don't think that's structurally possible. Red Hat will never invest in a project that doesn't contribute to their platform lock-in. Back when RH was a dominant platform, that was a strength. Nowadays it is a hindrance.",

Seth is the one researching the suppliers \"with the help of\" Claude. Seth is presumably the one deciding when to prompt Claude to make decisions about if they should plant in Iowa in how many days. I think I could also grow corn if someone came and asked me well defined questions and then acted on what I said. I might even be better at it because unlike a Claude output I will still be conscious in 30 seconds.That is a far cry from sitting down at a command like and saying \"Do everything necessary to grow 500 bushels of corn by October\".",

(I live the next county over, but I bike to Polk county all the time)  This is not a good location to run this because the farm land is owned by farmer/investors or farmer/developers - either way everybody knows the farm will become a suburb in the next 20 years and has priced accordingly (and if the timeline is is less than 5 years they have switched to mining mode - strip out the last fertility before the development destroys the land anyway). Which is to say you can get much better land deals elsewhere (and by making your search wider) - sometimes the price might be higher but that is because the land/soil is better.Overall I don't think this is useful. They might or might not get good results. However it is really hard to beat the farmer/laborer who lives close to the farm and thus sees things happen and can react quickly.  There is also great value in knowing your land, though they should get records of what has happened in the past (this is all in a computer, but you won't always get access to it when you buy/lease land). Farmers are already using computers to guide decisions.My prediction: they lose money.  Not because the AI does stupid things (though that might happen), but because last year harvests were really good and so supply and demand means many farms will lose money no matter what you do.  But if the weather is just right he could make a lot of money when other farmers have a really bad harvest (that is he has a large harvest but everyone else has a terrible harvest).Iowa has strong farm ownership laws. There is real risk he will get shutdown somehow because what he is doing is somehow illegal. I'm not sure what the laws are, check with a real lawyer.

This is fed back into a mapping system for fertilization and soil amendment in the spring to reduce costs where you don't need to put fertilizer. The tractors themselves do most of the driving themselves if you choose to get those packages added. You can get services that monitor storm damage and predict losses on your fields, and updated satellite feed information on growth patterns, soil moisture, vegetation loss, and more. Simply put super high automation is already available for farming. I tell my uncle his job is to make sure the tractor has diesel in it, and that nothing is jammed in the plow.When it comes to animal farming in the mid-west, a huge portion of it is done by contracts with other companies. My uncle owns the land and provides the labor, but the buildings, birds, food, and any other supplies.

He needs to decide when to harvest - too early and he pays a lot of money to dry the corn (and likely money to someone you hired to work who doesn't do anything), but too late and a storm can blow the corn off the cob...

This hits the perfect \"sweet spot\" of detail with clear \"cartoon\" coloring.I see a lot of criticism here that this isn't \"pixel art\", so maybe there's some better term to use.

This issue has always been fraught, because context and meaning and technique are all tangled up in these labels which are so important to some but so easily ignored by others.

You are notating what notes to play, when and for how long they play, what instrument plays them, and any modifications to the default sound of that instrument. Is writing sheet music tedious? Sure, it can be, when the speed of notating by hand can't keep up with the speed your brain is thinking through ideas. But being tedious is not mutually exclusive with being creative despite the attempt to explicitly contrast them as such, and the solution to the process of notating your creativity being tedious is not \"randomly generate a bunch of notes and instruments that have little relation with the ones you're thinking of\". This excerpt supposes that generative AI lets you automate the tedious part while keeping \"the quality of your decisions\", but it doesn't keep your decisions, it generates its own \"decisions\" from a broad, high-level prompt and your role is reduced to merely making decisions about whether or not you like the content generated, which is not creativity.",

I mean, technically that's true, and a lot of what I do daily can certainly be considered mundane.

In a way it feels a bit like magical roulette, never being quite certain of what you're going to get. It does have a bit of charm, when you chain the various snippets together you really don't know what direction it's gonna go.Using speaker Ryan seems to be the most consistent, I tried speaker Eric and it sounded like someone putting on a fake exaggerated Chinese accent to mock speakers.If it wasn't for the unpredictable level of emotions from each chunk, I'd say this is easily the highest quality TTS model I've tried.",

The 0.6B would inject some of that into the generated audio, whereas the 1.7B model would not.Also, without FlashAttention it was dog slow on my 5090, running at 0.3X realtime with just 30% GPU usage. Though I guess that's to be expected. No significant difference in generation speed between the two models.Overall though, I'm quite impressed.

It's a great metaphor because- besides the idea of lightness and freedom it communicates- it also described the computer as multiplier of the human strength- the bicycle allows one to travel faster and with much less effort, it's true, but ultimately the source of its power is still entirely in the muscles of the cyclist- you don't get out of it anything that you didn't put yourself.Bu the feeling I'm having with LLMs is that we've entered the age of fossil-fuel engines: something that moves on its own power and produces somewhat more than the user needs to put into it. Ok, in the current version it might not go very far and needs to be pushed now and then, but the total energy output is greater than what users need to put in. We could call it a horse, except that this is artificial: it's a tractor. And in the last months I've been feeling like someone who spent years pushing a plough in the fields, and has suddenly received a tractor. A primitive model, still imperfect, but already working.",

Use adversarial interop via services like SerpAPI (though Google is already taking legal action there)\n3.

If your product's moat depends entirely on a third-party API that can be yanked away with 12 months notice, you don't really have a sustainable business.Google is essentially saying: indie search is dead, pay enterprise prices or leave.

A simple cache or a CDN should be enough to handle pretty much any scrapping traffic unless you need to do some crazy logic on every page visit – which should almost never be the case on public-facing sites. As an example, my personal site is technically written in React, but it's fully pre-rendered and doesn't even serve JS – it can handle huge amounts of bot/scrapping traffic via its CDN.",

I spent several years recording outdoor activities with the Strava app on my phone, and always there was about a 1% failure rate where for one reason or another, the GPS trace was interrupted or corrupted.  With the Garmin watch this simply doesn't happen.  If it's recording, the recording is good, period.It is that, that has somehow been lost.  That devices that just do one thing and do it well have been replaced by apps on a device that, in the modern software fashion, are \"mostly\" debugged, get constant updates that may or may not remove bugs (or features!) and usually don't add anything useful.  One app got an update which, on my lower-end phone, changed it from crisply responsive to incredibly slow (5+ second response time to a tap). It worked fine before.",

And eagerly awaiting something comparable in the market, but reviews of competing products are not yet compelling.> \"I'm tired of distracting notifications so I'm getting Meta Ray-Ban AR glasses.\"These are for travel videos (dense markets, or places where I can't logistically use a phone or camera). My family enjoys the videos. If the glasses are capable of notifications, I haven't enabled them. The glasses have utility without notifications, and without a heads up display, they'd be of limited value.> Why is Linux growing in popularity?This was my point \"Integrated platforms seemingly made the Linux philosophy untenable, and yet it may now be growing as a direct result of this decoupling. This was a feature, not a bug.\"Linux is not part of an ecosystem, and people are starting to realize they like that for a variety of reasons. We're making the same point> People are sick of being spied on and being manipulated for profit. I don't think the OP wants to acknowledge that fact because it paints him as a technology hipster rather than someone taking back their autonomy from corporations. He's saying \"Look at me, I'm an individual because I choose to have a different set of companies spy on me than you do.\"The point is that there is growing optionality. It's becoming easier to participate across ecosystems. We can treat tech as an a la carte rather than an omakase menu. Your computer can be one thing, your phone another, and your wearables something else. It's hard to escape big tech entirely, but cracks are starting to form in terms of portability, and perhaps increasingly in terms of alternative options.> The other striking thing to me is that the list is also completely devoid of any sense of morality.I had assumed I could just buy a printer I like that's relatively affordable, on sale, and highly rated?

Part of that was a general lack of inspiration inside Apple’s ecosystem stranglehold, and I tend to hold onto their hardware for a long time anyway (I’m hoping to skip from M1 straight to M6 or later)A desire to spend less time purely in the software domain. Hardware can be fun. I originally studied electrical engineering but ended up spending all of my career in software; the 3D printer ties into a few side projects I’m working on, with mixed success.A preference for narrow, purpose-driven devices. I now use the Android phone for \"serious\" things with minimal distractions, and the iPhone for everything else. And if Apple or Google ever become untenable, I have some optionality (and this is my first non-Apple phone since my Blackberry).The programmable lights seemed kind of unavoidable. If you want lighting where you can change the color, the bundled software and ecosystem bloat is largely unavoidable.The mechanical watches are tied to travel and circumstance: a Casio from Japan, a Mondaine from Switzerland, and the Interstellar Hamilton Murph as a gift.

Home PC gaming, outside a handful of much-smaller niche use cases that're full of Windows-only software, was the only notable reason for a home user to have Windows at all, after the rise of Chromebooks and iPads to serve the rest of the home market. Valve's made ditching Windows for PC gaming viable for a high proportion of those remaining must-have-Windows users, which means Windows is hanging on to the home market by its fingernails. Just about all it has now is momentum, and that's fading.I also don't think any of that matters much, because it's done nothing at all to the enterprise market, which is still full of Windows and other Microsoft stuff and that shows no sign of shifting.",

It's like a rabbit hole of exploring the world, a more interconnected one where barriers of entry to knowledge are much lower.

At times it even shows some path which I hadn't thought of. Or it firms up a direction which I thought only had vague connection.To take one concrete example, it helped me get a well rounded picture of how British despite having such low footprint in India (at their peak there were about 150K of them) were able to colonise it with 300+ million population.",

My campus has relatively low enrollment, but has seen a massive increase in CS majors recently (for reasons I won’t go into) so they are hiring a lot without much instructional support in place. I was basically given zero preparation other than a zip file with the current instructor’s tests and homeworks (which are on paper, btw).I thought that I would be using LLMs for coding, but it turns out that they have been much more useful as a sounding board for conceptual framing that I’d like to use while teaching. I have strong opinions about good software design, some of them unconventional, and these conversations have been incredibly helpful for turning my vague notions into precise, repeatable explanations for difficult abstractions.",

The super implementation must be called if overriding a non-abstract method.The end result of strict adherence to these rules is basically that every feature will look like a GoF design pattern.

But writing them down is the only way to iron out all the ambiguity and sort out what’s really going to work and what isn’t.

I love it. And there are advantages to not involving LLMs too early in your process. But it’s just a first step and you need to write your ideas down and submit them to external scrutiny.

They all thought the actual good coffee was much better in the blind tasting, to the extent that they all permanently stopped drinking their previous coffee.

It was devised as a serialization format, a bit human-hostile, but mapped ideally to bag-of-named-values structures found in basically any modern language.Now we see XML tools adopted to JSON: JSONSchema, JSONPath, etc. JSON5 (as used in e.g. VSCode) allows for comments, trailing commas and other creature comforts.

The hilarious part is that he doesn't recognize the problem when he gives his example of \"or with attributes\".The other thing, is that the JSON model doesn't just give you a free parser/serializer in JavaScript.  It actually maps to the basic data model of the entire generation of dynamic languages that the Web grew on: perl, Python, JS, PHP and Ruby.  Arrays and maps are the basic way to represent structured data in these languages, and JSON just serializes that.  Which means that getting data in and out of your language is just a single line.The author seems to think that XML maps a proper conceptual model and JSON doesn't, but the model of \"nodes with attributes and content\" is a worse match for structured data than JSON's model of \"arrays and maps of values\".Other than that, it's really a question of how much tooling you want to use.  Both JSON and XML grew entire ecosystems of it, and nowadays if you want to read your JSON according to a schema into typed objects, you can, and for any good-sized project, you probably should.Also: \n> There are cases where other formats are appropriate: small data transfers between cooperating services and scenarios where schema validation would be overkill.That's actually most of the cases for your average web dev!",

      "abstract": "该讨论围绕去中心化代码协作平台Radicle展开。核心话题是探讨其作为基于Git的点对点代码托管方案，如何通过去中心化网络替代GitHub等中心化平台。社区普遍认同去中心化代码库是未来趋势，有人认为这类项目能推动GitHub等平台改进产品，也有用户指出点对点网络是网络可持续发展的唯一可行方向。\n\n讨论中主要争议点集中在技术实现与实用性方面。有用户质疑Git能否真正保证数据完整性与同步，认为Git并非CRDT，可能无法满足完善的复制协议需求。也有用户指出实际部署中的问题，如“宽松种子节点”可能面临大文件推送的存储压力，以及完整克隆导致仓库过大的隐患。同时，用户对Radicle与类似项目（如Tangled）的区别表示困惑，希望获得更清晰的对比。\n\n关于网络管理，讨论中提到节点可自主选择托管仓库并设置屏蔽策略，但如何应对滥用或非法内容仍存疑问。此外，有用户关注IPv6对点对点网络的优势，认为它能减少端口转发需求，但可能面临ISP封锁。总体而言，社区肯定Radicle的创新方向，但对技术细节、可扩展性及实际应用仍持审慎态度。",

This isn’t compatible with peer-to-peer in any useful way.> Radicle solves this by assigning stable identities to repositories that can be verified locally, allowing repositories to be served by untrusted parties.What does this mean, in practice?

There's no round-trip to a server. Issues and patches are stored as signed Git objects (COBs) that replicate with the repo itself. The network is only involved when you choose to sync. This makes it extremely performant for day-to-day work and fully functional offline.Tangled to my understanding is federated in theory but centralized in practice. It relies on \"knots\" (servers that host Git repos) and a central AppView at tangled.sh that aggregates the network. Issues and social artifacts live on Personal Data Servers, not locally. While you can self-host a knot, the default experience routes through Tangled's managed infrastructure. The architecture is fundamentally client-server: your operations go over the network to wherever your data lives.",

          "content": "Thanks for your detailed response.I guess what I mean is that trust is a hard problem, and a lot of solutions to trust involve transmuting a presupposed trust problem into a different trust problem with a slightly different security model.For example: with a centralized service, I assume that a given identity is integral so long as the service is secure. I don't need cryptographic identity for that centralized service, but that assumes I trust the service to be secure.With a distributed service, I need some way to ensure the integrity of identities. One way to do that is to TOFU, i.e. take a claimant identity on face value on first observation and then trust it going forwards. This works well for schemes like SSH, but it doesn't work super well for distributed user networks (because users like to lose their keys, and there's a larger potential surface area for undetectable key substitution).Another solution is a \"web of trust\" architecture, where you take an initial trusted core and transitively extend trust outwards. The problems with this are (1) that trust isn't actually transitive, and (2) it still presupposes a trusted core, which needs to be bootstrapped somehow.A third solution is a traditional PKI, where you have one or more pre-established identity \"authorities\" that sign for end user identities. This is the solution that HTTPS picks, and is arguably the most empirically proven of the decentralized identity schemes. But it's only as decentralized as the authorities themselves are, and there's a meaningful argument to be had about that (particularly in schemes that are smaller than the Web PKI).It sounds like Radicle is going with a mixture of (1) and (2), which is interesting and worth proving out. But my experience is that \"someone's SSH key\" is much less of a stable identity than we'd all like it to be, and schemes that involve delegating trust via unstable identities eventually run into architectural limitations that end users solve by just subverting the scheme itself (i.e. falling back to TOFU).> That aside, how do you know which people to trust when you meet them? And how do you signal trust in those you've met? In Radicle holding stable cryptographic identities doesn't resolve the zero-to-some trust problem but it does resolve the some-to-more trust problem, I can continue trusting once I recognise and know an identity.This is a good example both of how (1) social trust isn't easy to encode in cryptographic claims, and (2) how the transitivity of trust breaks down.In the real world, I trust my barber to cut my hair and my dentist to look at my teeth. But I only trust them for their apposite roles, and my trust in my barber doesn't necessarily mean anything to my friend who doesn't like my haircut.",

That gives the culture a lot of interesting properties that promote its ability to identify and coordinate against out-groups (which to the people involved would manifest as a \"these barbarians just don't know how to be polite and we can't work with them\").

Humans start by default as “Askers,” but society shapes them into either the “Askers” or “Guessers.” Kids don’t guess, they ask.I have also observed that Eastern countries/regions are generally “Guessers,” while Westerners are generally “Askers.”Growing up as an introvert, I remember many times when my guardians (uncles, aunties, grandparents, and parents) would interpret things differently than I thought they were. “My friend’s mom told me to come, play, and eat at their place today.” “No, they don’t. You need to come back after a while, not spend the whole day there.”I learnt a lot of Guesses in school and social settings: Yes, that meant No, and Nos that were weirdly Yes, etc.When I started working in the early 2000s, I worked with almost all US (and some UK and Australians) Companies and customers, from teachers and physicians to founders and businesspeople. Things were straightforward, “cut to the chase”, “get to the point real fast”, and the like.Eventually, I have also worked with many Indian companies and teams. We are mostly Guessers. My colleagues and bosses have called me aside to explain the interpretation of quite a few interactions, which I thought I was doing the right thing, but I should not have (even when the clients agreed). I’ve also worked with the Japanese, and they were all Guessers to a degree, and I would love to, hopefully, take the time and effort to learn the culture a lot more.",

The idea that I have to play some kind of 4D chess game to figure out what I am and am not allowed to ask or do makes me extremely stressed out. How am I supposed to map out the wishes and expectations and goals of everybody involved? Isn't that, in fact, borderline rude? What if I guess wrong? Everybody loses when that happens and it happens all the time.Growing up in the east of the Netherlands made this worse; the Dutch are widely known as rude and direct (ie Askers), but in the rural east this is very much not the case. Everything there runs on a mixture of \"what will the neighbours think\" and \"what will people expect me to do?\" and it's just maddening. Fortunately I was sufficiently tone deaf as a youth to not notice when I was getting it wrong, and when I grew old enough to figure that out I moved to places where you can just ask stuff. It's nuts that such a small country can have such a widely varying cultural differences but it's very real.I live in the south now and here I can ask everybody everything and people won't feel bad for saying no. It's lovely.I also figured out that my mom (a total Guesser like everybody in my family) loves me even if I get this wrong! So I just began to treat her like an Asker and verrry explicitly spell out that it's totally fine to say no, no really it is, I'm not asking for a favour, I just want to know what you want, really mom it's true. It stresses her out! The idea of being asked point blank for her personal, disregard-other-people preference is just entirely outside her normal way of thinking. She has to do hard effort to disregard other people's wishes, it's just all totally mixed together in her brain. I know it's not nice of me, but the alternative is that we (my wife and I) keep getting it wrong and accidentally visit too often or too little or invite them to parties they don't want to go to and so on.So yeah, protip for askers, treat guessers who love you as askers. They'll forgive you for it and everything else becomes easier.",

Because they can't use the C library directly, they had to use a Rust-to-C binding library, that uses Protobuf for portability reasons. Problem is that it is slow.So what they did is that they wrote their own non-portable but much more optimized Rust-to-C bindings, with the help of a LLM.But had they written their software in C, they wouldn't have needed to do any conversion at all. It means they could have titled the article \"How we lowered the performance penalty of using Rust\".I don't know much about Rust or libpg_query, but they probably could have gone even faster by getting rid of the conversion entirely. It would most likely have involved major adaptations and some unsafe Rust though. Writing a converter has many advantages: portability, convenience, security, etc... but it has a cost, and ultimately, I think it is a big reason why computers are so fast and apps are so slow. Our machines keep copying, converting, serializing and deserializing things.Note: I have nothing against what they did, quite the opposite, I always appreciate those who care about performance, and what they did is reasonable and effective, good job!",

That use case runs in the background, and as such is much less performance critical.pg_query actually initially used a JSON format for the parse output (AST), but we changed that to Protobuf a few major releases ago, because Protobuf makes it easy to have typed bindings in the different languages we support (Ruby, Go, Rust, Python, etc). Alternatives (e.g. using FFI directly) make sense for Rust, but would require a lot of maintained glue code for other languages.All that said, I'm supportive of Lev's effort here, and we'll add some additional functions (see [0]) in the libpg_query library to make using it directly (i.e. via FFI) easier. But I don't see Protobuf going away, because in non-performance critical cases, it is more ergonomic across the different bindings.[0]: https://github.com/pganalyze/libpg_query/pull/321",

You spend a lot of times reverse engineering C code to get an idea of the intent of those who had wrote the code. You need to know which pointers can address the same memory. You need to know which pointers can be NULL or just plain invalid. You need to know which pointers you get from C code or pass to it along with ownership, and which are just borrowed. It maybe (and often is) unclear from the documentation, so you are going to read a lot of C code, trying to guess what the authors were thinking when writing it. Generating hypotheses about the library behavior (like 'library never does THIS with the pointer') and trying to prove them by finding all the code dealing with the pointer.It can be easy in easy situations, or it can be really tricky and time consuming.

Reasoning about ABI compatibility across different C++ versions and optimization levels and architectures can be a nightmare, let alone different programming languages.The reason it works at all for Arrow is that the leaf levels of the data model are large contiguous columnar arrays, so reconstructing the higher layers still gets you a lot of value. The other domains where it works are tensors/DLPack and scientific arrays (Zarr etc). For arbitrary struct layouts across languages/architectures/versions, serdes is way more reliable than a universal ABI.",

Prior to the industrial revolution, peasant farmers of varying types made up the overwhelming majority of people in settled societies (the sort with cities and writing). And when I say overwhelming, I mean overwhelming: we generally estimate these societies to have consisted of upwards of 80% peasant farmers, often as high as 90 or even 95%. Yet when we talk about these periods, we are often focused on aristocrats, priests, knights, warriors, kings and literate bureaucrats, the sort of folks who write to us or on smiths, masons and artists, the sort of folk whose work sometimes survives for us to see.

Two points: this was normal, but of course their numbers were controlled by inconsistent weather. The feast and famine cycle over the year mean even that 10 was not evenly distributed. The people are also of course nomadic, but not as much as you might think in that the procession follows a 'route' which looks much like the seasons in agricultural society.

Real history was full of system failures like floods and unfair taxes that prevented any real progress.

It basically makes super careful planning impractical.I think most of the problems are downstream of this. For example, your fields will probably have to be moved after a couple years. The city will expand and you’ll want to replace it with higher-value industry. And you’ll be scouting out a new massive area for your new fields, which will make your old ones obsolete.

          "content": "> It’s also common to find long-running idle queries in PostgreSQL. Configuring timeouts like idle_in_transaction_session_timeout is essential to prevent them from blocking autovacuum.Idle transactions have been a huge footgun at $DAYJOB… our code base is full of “connect, start a transaction, do work, if successful, commit.” It means you’re consuming a connection slot for all work, even while you’re not using the database, and not releasing it until you’re done. We had to bump the Postgres connection limits by an order of magnitude, multiple times, and before you know it Postgres takes up more RAM than anything else just to support the number of connections we need.The problem permeated enough of our (rust) codebase that I had to come up with a compile time check that makes sure you’re not awaiting any async functions while a Postgres connection is in your scope. Using the .await keyword on an async function call, but not passing the pg connection to that function, ends up being a nearly perfect proxy for “doing unrelated work while not releasing a connection”. It worked extremely well, the compiler now just straight up tells us where we’re doing it wrong (in 100+ places in fact.)Actually getting away from that pattern has been the hard part, but we’re almost rid of every place we’re doing it, and I can now run with a 32-connection pool in load testing instead of a 10,000 connection pool and there’s no real slowdowns. (Not that we’d go that low in production but it’s nice to know we can!)Just decreasing the timeout for idle transactions would have probably been the backup option, but some of the code that holds long transactions is very rarely hit, and it would have taken a lot of testing to eliminate all of it if we didn’t have the static check.",

They have been mentioned before, but I haven't seen a substantial rationale.Sharding is almost only analyzed from the perspective of write scaling. But sharding may not only be about write scaling, but a path to reducing blast radius. And this is something that triggers much earlier than write scaling needs (especially given how well Postgres scales vertically and reads).When you shard your database, you end up having N clusters (for HA purposes, each \"shard\" must be a primary-replica(s) cluster itself), each holding 1/Nth of the data.There are certain scenarios which, while unlikely, may hit you: data corruption in the WAL replication stream, a problem during a major upgrade, a situation that requires a whole cluster restore from a backup, you name it. For those cases, the whole cluster may experience notable downtime.If you have a single cluster, 100% of your users experience downtime. If you sharded into N clusters, only 1/Nth of your users experience downtime. For a company servicing 800M users the difference from both scenarios is dramatically different. Even for much much smaller companies.I'm puzzled why this is not perceived as a risk, and if it is not, how it is mitigated.While I wouldn't advocate to shard \"too early\", given that it comes with notable caveats, I believe more and more in sharding your workloads when possible more earlier than later. Way before truly needing it from a write scaling perspective. Because apart from reducing the blast radius, it applies implicitly the principle of \"divide-and-conquer\", and your problems become much more manageable (your number of connections per cluster decreases at will, backup restore times can be a fraction of the time, logical replication can be considered as a true option for replication/upgrades/etc if you keep shards relatively small and many other operational procedures are greatly simplified if now you have much smaller databases, even if you have many more of them).",

Yes, it does promote Azure, but that's to be expected from a company with is part owned by Microsoft :).The main point of the article is that it's actually not that hard to live with a single primary Postgres for your transactional workloads (emphasis on _transactional_), and if OpenAI with their 800M+ users can still survive on a single primary (with 50(!) read replicas), so could you, especially before you've reached your first 100M users.Any non-distributed database or setup is orders of magnitude easier to design for, and it's also typically much more cost efficient too, both in terms of hardware and software too.There are some curious details, e.g.:- you can ship WAL to 50 read replicas simultaneously from a single primary and be fine\n- you can even be using an ORM and still get decent performance\n- schema changes are possible, and you can just cancel a slow ALTER to prevent production impact\n- pgbouncer is ok even for OpenAI scaleThere are so many things that contradict current \"conventional wisdom\" based on the experience from what was possible with the hardware 10+ (or even 20+) years ago.

This is largely due to PostgreSQL’s multiversion concurrency control (MVCC) implementation, which makes it less efficient for write-heavy workloads. For example, when a query updates a tuple or even a single field, the entire row is copied to create a new version. Under heavy write loads, this results in significant write amplification. It also increases read amplification, since queries must scan through multiple tuple versions (dead tuples) to retrieve the latest one.

Like every other architect, I searched for a good database and eventually gave up on specialized ones for chat because they were either too expensive to host or too complex to deal with. So, I simply just used PostgreSQL. My chat app has basic RAG, not ground breaking or anything - but the most important feature I made was ability to add different chat models into one group chat. So, when you ask for opinions on something - you are not relying on just a single model and you can get a multi-model view of all the possible answers. Each model can have its own unique prompt within the group chat. So basically, a join table.Months passed by since this application was developed (a simple Phoenix/Elixir backend), and yesterday I was casually checking my database to see how many rows it had - about 500,000+ roughly. I didn't notice a single hint of the volume the Postgres was handling, granted - I'm the only user, but there's always a lot going on - RAG, mostly that requires searching of the database for context before multiple agents send you a response (and respond amongst themselves). Absolutely zero performance degradation.I'm convinced that Postgres is a killer database that doesn't get the attention it deserves over the others (for chat).

So that function that calls that slow external service, also takes a &PgConnection as an argument, because it wants to bump a timestamp in a table somewhere after the call is complete. Which means you need to already have a connection open to even call that function, etc etc.If the codebase is large, and full of that kind of pattern (interleaving db writes with other work), the compiler plugin is nice for (a) giving you a TODO list of all the places you’re doing it wrong, and (b) preventing any new code from doing this while you’re fixing all the existing cases.One idea was to bulk-replace everything so that we pass a reference to the pool itself around, instead of a checked-out connection/transaction, and then we would only use a connection for each query on-demand, but that’s dangerous… some of these functions are doing writes, and you may be relying on transaction rollback behavior if something fails. So if you were doing 3 pieces of “work” with a single db transaction before, and the third one failed, the transaction was getting rolled back for all 3. But if you split that into 3 different short-lived connections, now only the last of the 3 db operations is rolled back. So you can’t just find/replace, you need to go through and consider how to re-order the code so that the database calls happen “logically last”, but are still grouped together into a single transaction as before, to avoid subtle consistency bugs.",

Some time back I commented on the behaviour: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45758543You could use asynchronous WAL shipping, where the WAL files are uploaded to an object store (S3 / Azure Blob) and the streaming connections are only used to signal the position of WAL head to the replicas. The replicas will then fetch the WAL files from the object store and replay them independently. This is what wall-g does, for a real life example.The tradeoffs when using that mechanism are pretty funky, though. For one, the strategy imposes a hard lower bound to replication delay because even the happy path is now \"primary writes WAL file; primary updates WAL head position; primary uploads WAL file to object store; replica downloads WAL file from object store; replica replays WAL file\". In case of unhappy write bursts the delay can go up significantly. You are also subject to any object store and/or API rate limits. The setup makes replication delays slightly more complex to monitor for, but for a competent engineering team that shouldn't be an issue.But it is rather hilarious (in retrospect only) when an object store performance degdaration takes all your replicas effectively offline and the readers fail over to getting their up-to-date data from the single primary.",

The locks might be short lived (for example, just a catalogue update to add a column), but they are nevertheless heavyweight and both block and are blocked by other work.SELECT or DML operations take a lightweight lock on the table that doesn't block most other work, but it does block these schema changes. While the schema change is waiting to acquire the table lock, all new operations (like new SELECTs, for example) get blocked until the schema change completes.So the following scenario can be pretty disastrous:* Start a long-running SELECT operation on table* Attempt to apply schema change to the table* All new work on the table is blocked until the SELECT completes and the schema change can apply.* Production outageWhat the ChatGPT folks do is set a lock timeout when applying the schema change to make it 'give up' after a few seconds. This works to avoid truly excessive impact (in their case, they may have micro-outages of up to 5s while trying to apply schema), but has problems - firstly, they then need to retry, which may lead to more micro-outages, and secondly there's no guarantee on a system with mixed workload that they will be able to force the change through, and the schema change just ends up getting starved out.A better alternative for most workloads is to build a system that detects what workload is blocking your schema change and kills it, allowing the schema change to go through quickly and unblock all the work behind it. You'd still use a lock timeout with this to be on the safe side, but it shouldn't be necessary in most cases.Side note on transactional DDL - for Postgres systems with high throughput, most people just use autocommit.

      "abstract": "该讨论围绕“从黑胶唱片启动计算机”这一技术实验展开。社区成员主要探讨了利用非传统存储介质作为启动设备的可能性与挑战。有人认为，类似黑胶唱片、录音磁带甚至纸质条形码等介质在理论上可通过定制引导程序实现启动，历史上也有通过广播传输软件的先例。也有用户指出，这类介质通常存在随机访问性能差、数据密度低等局限，但作为一种技术探索仍具有趣味性。讨论中提到，部分用户分享了相关实践，如将可启动的Atari程序嵌入唱片沟槽，或设想通过扫描仪读取纸质编码来引导系统。整体上，社区对此类创意实验持积极态度，视其为对早期计算机存储方式的一种怀旧与技术致敬。",

With six players you can load the file in 1:02 instead of 6:10.

Well, depending on your machine, potentially very crappy.One of the better cassette loaders can be found in the 6809 based Tandy CoCo machines.  When in the cassette times, I would stress test various machines.My Atari was bog slow, reading a block at a time, with a pause between... And it was picky and really wanted the dedicated cassette drive.  Not recommended at all..Apples were pretty OK, along with the Tandy machines.  The Tandy reader software, whoever wrote it, took full advantage of the nice CPU and 6 bit DAC.  I could rest a finger on the tape, slowing it down, then listening to the wow, flutter and speed changes all over the place while the machine recovered.  Almost always loaded correctly.The Apples were not that robust, but worked well enough to not be a big bother.Both Apple and Tandy machines had good commands for loading and saving right to regions of RAM.On the Apple, with the spiffy Mini-assembler, it was possible to develop big programs a piece at a time, saving off stuff that worked.Every so often, it made sense to read a bunch in and save off a nice chunk!  Always felt good doing that.Eventually, you load it all, patch it up, linker style, maybe moving bits around some, and then save it as a completed assembly program.No source, just the data on the tape and what the mini-assembler would show you when you list memory.Good times!",

I was going to say, the end resulting light should be a pretty saturated spectrum, given that many RF sources just keep pumping out waves, and the those waves propagating and bouncing around.I think one fun application would be a light which represents your wi-fi strength around the house. Obviously in a smaller apartment that's really not a problem, but in larger houses it would be fun to see.Another application would be to find hidden RF sources / leaks. I have a home recording studio, and for the life I could not find some RF source that kept adding noise / interference. I could roughly detect the frequency of the noise, but not its origin. I guess if I had a couple of RF sensors I could try to triangulate my way to it.",

If there's no tone the two signals are exactly in phase - the two aerials are exactly the same distance from the transmitter.If you look on some police cars you'll see a group of four aerials about 15cm apart stuck to the roof which used to be used for \"Lojack\" style trackers.There are a whole bunch of circuit diagrams floating around for doing this kind of thing, with the simplest being Ye Olde 555 timer and a couple of PIN diodes!",

We can monitor the wound and its secretions, can cover exposed tendons and bones without immediate doing microsurgical flaps. For example, we can monitor the second intention skin closure with reduced infection and analgesics use, sometimes without needing a graft at all.",

That said, my impression of most of that documentation from that time is that it was incorrectly using .local as a fake TLD where they should have been using .example or .example.com and also pointing people to the RFCs that those were not valid choices in a real setup. A problem with such documentation is that it is too easy to take literally. A follow up problem was sort of the \"accidental security through obscurity\" benefits of using non-globally resolvable addresses becomes \"best practice\" through essentially stubbornness and status quo (related to all the recent rediscussions on HN about NAT44 is not a firewall except by accident and you can have very good firewalls that aren't NAT44).",

For example, suppose you have two versions of a pop function, one imported from a stack library, and another from a heap library. If you use a tool like the dumb-jump package in Emacs and you use it to jump to the definition for a call to pop, it might get confused as to where to go because it’s not sure what module is in scope at the point. A language server, on the other hand, should have access to this information and would not get confused.You are correct that a language server will generally provide correct navigation/autocomplete,\nbut a language server doesn’t necessarily need to hook into an existing compiler: a language server might be a latency-sensitive re-implementation of an existing compiler toolchain (rust-analyzer is the one I’m most familiar with, but the recent crop of new language servers tend to take this direction if the language’s compiler isn’t query-oriented).> It is possible to use the language server for syntax highlighting. I am not aware of any particularly strong reasons why one would want to (or not want to) do this.Since I spend a lot of time writing Rust, I’ll use Rust as an example: you can highlight a binding if it’s mutable or style an enum/struct differently. It’s one of those small things that makes a big impact once you get used to it: editors without semantic syntax highlighting (as it is called in the LSP specification) feel like they’re naked to me.",

          "content": "C# Language Designer here, and one of the designers/architects of 'Roslyn', the semantic analysis engine that powers the C#/VB compilers, VS IDE experiences, and our LSP server.The original post conflates some concepts worth separating. LSP and language servers operate at an IDE/Editor feature level, whereas tree-sitter is a particular technological choice for parsing text and producing a syntax tree. They serve different purposes but can work together.What does a language server actually do? LSP defines features like:  1. Finding references (`textDocument/references`)\n\n  2. Go-to-definition (`textDocument/definition`)\n\n  3. Syntax highlighting (`textDocument/semanticTokens/...`)\n\n  4. Code completion, diagnostics, refactorings\n\nA language server for language X could use tree-sitter internally to implement these features. But it can use whatever technologies it wants. LSP is protocol-level; tree-sitter is an implementation detail.The article talks about tree-sitter avoiding the problem of \"maintaining two parsers\" (one for the compiler, one for the editor). This misunderstands how production compiler/IDE systems actually work. In Roslyn, we don't have two parsers. We have one parser that powers both the compiler and the IDE. Same code, same behavior, same error recovery. This works better, not worse. You want your IDE to understand code exactly the way the compiler does, not approximately.The article highlights tree-sitter being \"error-tolerant\" and \"incremental\" as key advantages. These are real concerns. If you're starting from scratch with no existing language infrastructure, tree-sitter's error tolerance is valuable. But this isn't unique to tree-sitter. Production compiler parsers are already extremely error-tolerant because they have to be. People are typing invalid code 99% of the time in an editor.Roslyn was designed from day one for IDE scenarios. We do incremental parsing (https://github.com/dotnet/roslyn/blob/main/docs/compilers/De...), but more importantly, we do incremental semantic analysis. When you change a file, we recompute semantic information for just the parts that changed, not the entire project. Tree-sitter gives you incremental parsing. That's good. But if you want rich IDE features, you need incremental semantics too.The article suggests language servers are inherently \"heavy\" while tree-sitter is \"lightweight.\" This isn't quite right. An LSP server is as heavy or light as you make it. If all you need is parsing and there's no existing language library, fine, use tree-sitter and build a minimal LSP server on top. But if you want to do more, LSP is designed for that. The protocol supports everything from basic syntax highlighting to complex refactorings.Now, as to syntax highlighting.  Despite the name, it isn't just syntactic in modern IDEs. In C#, we call this \"classification,\" and it's powered by the full semantic model. A reference to a symbol is classified by what that symbol is: local, parameter, field, property, class, struct, type parameter, method, etc. Symbol attributes affect presentation. Static members are italicized, unused variables are faded, overwritten values are underlined. We classify based on runtime behavior: `async` methods, `const` fields, extension methods.This requires deep semantic understanding. Binding symbols, resolving types, understanding scope and lifetime. Tree-sitter gives you a parse tree. That's it. It's excellent at what it does, but it's fundamentally a syntactic tool.Example: in C#, `var x = GetValue();` is syntactically ambiguous. Is `var` a keyword or a type name? Only semantic analysis can tell you definitively. Tree-sitter would have to guess or mark it generically.Tree-sitter is definitely a great technology though. Want to add basic syntax highlighting for a new language to your editor? Tree-sitter makes this trivial. Need structural editing or code folding? Perfect use case. However, for rich IDE experiences, the kind where clicking on a variable highlights all its uses, or where hovering shows documentation, or where renaming a method updates all call sites across your codebase, you need semantic analysis. That's a fundamentally different problem than parsing.Tree-sitter definitely lowers the barrier to supporting new languages in editors. But it's not a replacement for language servers or semantic analysis engines. They're complementary technologies. For languages with mature compilers and semantic engines (C#, TypeScript, Rust, etc.), using the real compiler infrastructure for IDE features makes sense. For cases with simpler tooling needs, tree-sitter is an excellent foundation to build on.",

In this case, treesitter has to guess, and it might guess wrong.As for what can you do with an AST and what can't you: you can tell if something is a function call, a variable reference, or any other piece of syntax, but if you write something like x = 2; then tree-sitter has no idea what x is, is it a float, an int? is it a local, a class variable, or a global?

So there was no room for divergence bugs in parsers, and there was also no need to figure out how to encode oddities and ambiguity-breaking logic in limited formats like tmLanguage.This all predated TSServer (which predated LSP, though that's coming in TypeScript 7). The latency for syntax highlighting over JSON was too much, and other editors often didn't make syntax highlighting available outside of tmLanguage anyway. Eventually semantic highlighting became a thing, which is more latency-tolerant, and overlays colors on top of a syntactic highlighter in VS Code.The other issue with this approach was that we still needed a dedicated thread just for fast syntax highlighting.

If you rely solely on LSP for highlighting, you introduce a flash of unstyled content or color-shifting artifacts every time you type, because the round-trip to the server (even a local one) and the subsequent re-tokenization takes longer than the frame budget.The ideal hygiene could be something like -> tree-sitter provides the high-speed lexical coloring (keywords, punctuation, basic structure) instantly and LSP paints the semantic modifiers (interfaces vs classes, mutable vs const) asynchronously like 200ms later.

          "content": "LSPs rely on a parser to generate an AST for a given language. This parser needs to be error-tolerant because it needs to return usable ASTs despite often parsing incomplete, incorrect code and fast enough to run on every keystroke so it can provide realtime feedback.Most of the time they rely on their own hand-rolled recursive descent parser. Writing these isn't necessarily hard but time-consuming and tedious especially if you're parsing a large language like C++.Parser generators like yacc, bison, chumsky, ANTLR etc. can generate a parser for you given a grammar. However these parsers usually don't have the best performance or error reporting characteristics because they are auto-generated. A recursive descent parser is usually faster and because you can customize syntax error messages, easier for an LSP to use to provide good diagnostics.Tree-sitter is also a parser generator but has better error tolerance properties (not quite as good as hand-written but generally better than prior implementations). Additionally, its incremental meaning it can reuse prior parses to more efficiently create a new AST. Most hand-written parsers are not incremental but are usually still fast enough to be usable in LSPs.To use tree-sitter you define a grammar in JavaScript that tree-sitter will use to generate a parser in C which you can then use a dynamic or static library in your application.In your case, this is useful because you can compile down those C libraries to WASM which can run right in the browser and will usually be faster than pure JS (the one catch is serialization overhead between JS and WASM). The problem is that you still need to implement all the language analysis features on top.A good overview of different parsing techniques: https://tratt.net/laurie/blog/2020/which_parsing_approach.ht...\nLSP spec: https://microsoft.github.io/language-server-protocol/overvie...\nVSCode's guide on LSP features: https://code.visualstudio.com/api/language-extensions/progra...\nTutorial on creating hand-rolled error-tolerant (but NOT incremental) recursive descent parsers: https://matklad.github.io/2023/05/21/resilient-ll-parsing-tu...\nTree-sitter book: https://tree-sitter.github.io/tree-sitter/",

          "content": "> Hmm, the strong reason could be latency and layout stability. Tree-sitter parses on the main thread (or a close worker) typically in sub-ms timeframesOne of the designers/architects of 'Roslyn' here, the semantic analysis engine that powers the C#/VB compilers, VS IDE experiences, and our LSP server.Note: For roslyn, we aim for microsecond (not millisecond) parsing.  Even for very large files, even if the initial parse is milliseconds, we have an incremental parser design (https://github.com/dotnet/roslyn/blob/main/docs/compilers/De...) that makes 99.99+% of edits happen in microseconds, while reusing 99.99+ of syntax nodes, while also producing an independent, immutable tree (thus ensuring no threading concerns sharing these trees out to concurrent consumers).> you introduce a flash of unstyled content or color-shifting artifacts every time you type, because the round-trip to the server (even a local one) and the subsequent re-tokenization takes longer than the frame budget.This would indicate a serious problem somewhere.It's also no different than any sort of modern UI stack.  A modern UI stack would never want external code coming in that could ever block it.  So all, potentially unbounded, processing work will be happening off the UI thread, ensuring that that thread is always responsive.Note that \"because the round-trip to the server (even a local one)\" is no different from round-tripping to a processing thread.  Indeed, in Visual Studio that is how it works as we have no need to run our server in a separate process space.  Instead, the LSP server itself for roslyn simply runs in-process in VS as a normal library.  No different than any other component that might have previously been doing this work.> Relying on LSP for the base layer makes the editor feel sluggish.It really should not.  Note: this does take some amount of smart work.  For example, in roslyn's classification systems we have a cascading set of classifying threads.  One that classifies lexically, one for syntax, one for semantics, and finally, one for embedded languages (imagine embedded regex/json, or even C# nested in c#).  And, of course, these embedded languages have cascading classification as well :DNote that this concept is used in other places in LSP as well.  For example, our diagnostics server computes compiler-syntax, vs compiler-semantics, versus 3rd-party analyzers, separately.The approach of all of this has several benefits.  First, we can scale up with the capabilities of the machine.  So if there are free cores, we can put them to work computing less relevant data concurrently.  Second, as results are computed on some operation, it can be displayed to the user without having to wait for the rest to finish.  Being fine-grained means the UI can appear crisp and responsive, while potentially slower operations take longer but eventually appear.For example, compiler syntax diagnostics generally take microseconds.  While 3rd-party analyzer diagnostics might take seconds.  No point in stalling the former while waiting for the latter to run.  LSP makes multi-plexing this stuff easy",

These are absent in js, making things much more costly. See the document on red-green trees I wrote here for more detail: https://github.com/dotnet/roslyn/blob/main/docs/compilers/De...• The problem domains are a bit different. In Roslyn the design is a highly concurrent, multi-threaded feature-set that wants to share immutable data. Ts/JS being single threaded doesn't have the same concerns. So there is less need to efficiently create an immutable data structure.  So having it be mutable meant working well with the engines of the time, with sacrificing too much.• The ts parser is incremental, and operates very similarly to what I describe in for Roslyn in https://github.com/dotnet/roslyn/blob/main/docs/compilers/De....

I've always been a big fan of TUI applications like lazygit, k9s, and dive. And then the idea came to build a TUI application that shows devices on your LAN. I am by no means a networking expert, but it was fun to figure out how ARP works, and discovery protocols such as mDNS and SSDP.Example usage:---# install via HomeBrew\nbrew tap ramonvermeulen/whosthere\nbrew install whosthere# or with go install\ngo install github.com/ramonvermeulen/whosthere@latest# run as TUI\nwhosthere# run as daemon\nwhosthere daemon --port 8080---I'd love to hear your feedback, if you have ideas for additional features or improvements that is highly appreciated! Current platform support is Linux and MacOS.",

So effectively the vibrating string becomes part of an oscillator circuit.We can imagine a harp like instrument (or koto) with multiple steel strings, oscillating under a Sustainiac-like pickup feeedback system, and used as the basis for synthesis.It looks as if the reeds in the Korg instrument might work similarly.This video is nice because it talks about the feel of the Sustainiac: how it \"kicks in\" and you feel the vibration swell just when you fret a note with your left hand.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hsbdvkIua8oThis one does a good job of demoing the three way harmonic switch:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LZwPPGsxY6gYou can sustain the fundamental, or have it go to the octave harmonic, or even a higher harmonic above that.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hsbdvkIua8o",

One of the appeals of a synthesizer is its spectral plasticity, and the output of the Phase8 relies too heavily on the sonic characteristics of the resonator medium.  My vibraphone definitely suffers from this, and has the cultural baggage of being a recognizable instrument, but it is a much more pleasing sameness than the Phase8.",

And, in principle, I'm all for more ways to create music existing - especially ones which are interactive and tactile. But the reality is, if I bought this device it would end up spending most of its time in the basement graveyard with all the other cool tools that are too narrow, too big, too hard to interface, store/recall patches, etc.I decided several years ago to refocus on a stack that's purely microphone (or other a/d converted input) + MIDI controllers to a DAW driving infinite layers of internal real-time digital synthesis, analog modeling and effects plug-ins. There are fabulously expressive MPE (MIDI Polyphonic Expression) controllers now which can capture every nuance of input my hands, feet and breath could ever provide. As you highlighted, the feeling that creating in a digital audio workstation is \"too easy\" or maybe somehow  'soulless' - is all in my head. That lurking suspicion analog circuitry or electro-mechanical waveforms are more authentic or pure is just magical thinking.Always believing that the next new box's cool-looking tactile input, novel interaction model or unique set of opinionated constraints will unleash my creativity - is just getting in the way of actually sitting down and making myself create with all the insanely powerful, wildly creative, infinitely flexible, hyper-productive digital tools I already have. Being able to save and recall entire racks worth of patching at the press of a button isn't soulless or limiting - unless I let it be. Feeling like I need just-one-more new device to inspire me with its defaults or constrain me with its limits - is the limiting constraint I finally realized was holding me back.",

I manage the bulk of my info/knowledge base across mostly locally-saved text files, with a few other tidbits leveraging PDFs and word process files (.odt, .docx)...and really i only use the latter for pasting in screenshots. And, then of course simply synching them across devices using syncthing.While my approach works great for the majority of the time, i can imagine there might be some functions that some other tools might bring me which i might be missing...I suppose one thing that i lack is a graph of linkages for content that might live in different, separate files but might be related, etc. So, would you be willing to share your opinion, experience for what makes zotero better than text files on a disk? :-) Thanks!",
