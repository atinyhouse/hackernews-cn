      "abstract": "该讨论围绕巴菲特卸任伯克希尔哈撒韦CEO展开。核心话题聚焦于对其投资生涯的评价及其个人特质。多数用户表达了对巴菲特的敬意，认为他通过坚持价值投资、专注基本面分析取得了非凡成就，有用户指出其致股东信的透明沟通方式值得赞赏，也有用户分享作为股东从中获利的感激之情。\n\n讨论中出现了不同观点：有人认为不应过度神化个人，强调理性看待其成就；另有用户提及伯克希尔已完成其历史使命，即改造低效大公司的时代可能已过去；还有用户对其在苹果股价上涨前减持表示质疑。关于工作与退休的价值观也存在分歧，有用户不解巴菲特为何高龄仍工作，而其他人则认为这体现了他的热情。\n\n共识在于普遍认可巴菲特作为杰出投资者的地位及其长期投资哲学的价值，但对其具体决策效果及个人崇拜现象持有不同看法。",

          "content": "We should never idolize a person (in my opinion). Here are some things Buffet has done that I admire (notice that phrasing):  - He consistently communicated with shareholders of Berkshire in a straight-forward and transparent way in his letters and annual reports. If you read these documents, I believe that you will have a solid understanding of how he built Berkshire.\n  - He maintained a disciplined approach to investing and managing risk over 60+ years.\n  - He still lives in the same home he bought when he was 28 years old.\n\nOur society has become moralistic. It's so much more useful to identify behaviors to learn from - either to emulate or to avoid - than to debate whether various public figures are good or bad people.That said, it makes me a little sad that we've read the last of his annual letters.",

Like many ultra wealthy people who are caught up in evaluating companies solely on financial grounds, Buffet ignores what the impact of his choices are. And let’s be real - there isn’t any “fair competition” in many parts of the American economy to fix these problems. The railways are especially problematic because the infrastructure they own creates monopolies in regions.",

I mean he mostly lived in Nebraska... give me a tiny fraction of his wealth and I would have taken right off out of Nebraska as the first thing I did, to go live somewhere warm and sunny.He also seemed a bit more aware of how much power money can translate into, and it seems he kind of stuck to \"being rich\" rather than shooting for \"rich and also politically powerful\" (although I'm sure there are probably a few exceptions).Compare his investment in the Washington Post with Bezos'. Buffett actually made money off it, and kept his hands off the direction of the paper. We all saw how much Bezos started leaning on it - which has had the effect of shedding subscribers as no one trusts it any more, and it's not attracting new readers of...  the Fox News persuasion I guess we can call it.It also seems he mostly stuck to what he knows in terms of kind of boring investments rather than flashy rockets and other showy things.And of course he's been good with giving his money away and convincing others to do likewise.",

There are many many reasons why one would work after being financially secure, and they're all equally valid as a personal motivator.And, anyways, I think you say this now, but if you were to get those 10 millions you would probably change your tune.

But it’s also very approachable by any successful employee of a company (maybe salary of a director or VP of any large company could afford it). It doesn’t represent what I could afford if I wanted to really get into the elite neighborhoods of my city. I don’t really enjoy people in those areas. They tend to always talk about money in one way or another (vacations, private schools, cars, houses, maids, nanny’s, etc). Nothing wrong with it I suppose, just not my jam and not how I want my children raised and not the people I want as my neighbors and peers. I’ve always been much more envious of those unsuspecting rich people that drive clunker cars or live in modest homes and mow their own lawns but then you find out they paid for 16 grand children to go to college or something random like that.

Don't even think about buying a Rolex until you have so much money coming in from interest that you don't even know what else to do with it.

It may be worth pointing out again ChatGPT was introduced to us in November 2022.I still dont believe AGI, ASI or Whatever AI will take over human in short period of time say 10 - 20 years. But it is hard to argue against the value of current AI, which many of the vocal critics on HN seems to have the opinion of. People are willing to pay $200 per month, and it is getting $1B dollar runway already.Being more of a Hardware person, the most interesting part to me is the funding of all the developments of latest hardware. I know this is another topic HN hate because of the DRAM and NAND pricing issue. But it is exciting to see this from a long term view where the pricing are short term pain. Right now the industry is asking, we have together over a trillion dollar to spend on Capex over the next few years and will even borrow more if it needs to be, when can you ship us 16A / 14A / 10A and 8A or 5A, LPDDR6, Higher Capacity DRAM at lower power usage, better packaging, higher speed PCIe or a jump to optical interconnect? Every single part of the hardware stack are being fused with money and demand. The last time we have this was Post-PC / Smartphone era which drove the hardware industry forward for 10 - 15 years. The current AI can at least push hardware for another 5 - 6 years while pulling forward tech that was initially 8 - 10 years away.I so wished I brought some Nvidia stock. Again, I guess no one knew AI would be as big as it is today, and it is only just started.",

          "content": "I predict 2026 will be the year of the first AI Agent \"worm\" (or virus?). Kind of like the Morris worm running amok as an experiment gone wrong, I think we will sometime soon have someone set up an AI agent whose core loop is to try to propagate itself, either as an experiment or just for the lulz.The actual Agent payload would be very small, likely just a few hundred line harness plus system prompt. It's just a question of whether the agent will be skilled enough to find vulnerabilities to propagate. The interesting thing about an AI worm is that it can use different tricks on different hosts as it explores its own environment.If a pure agent worm isn't capable enough, I could see someone embedding it on top of a more traditional virus. The normal virus would propagate as usual, but it would also run an agent to explore the system for things to extract or attack, and to find easy additional targets on the same internal network.A main difference here is that the agents have to call out to a big SotA model somewhere. I imagine the first worm will simply use Opus or ChatGPT with an acquired key, and part of it will be trying to identify (or generate) new keys as it spreads.Ultimately, I think this worm will be shut down by the model vendor, but it will have to have made a big enough splash beforehand to catch their attention and create a team to identify and block keys making certain kinds of requests.I'd hope OpenAI, Anthropic, etc have a team and process in place already to identify suspicious keys, eg, those used from a huge variety of IPs, but I wouldn't be surprised if this were low on their list of priorities (until something like this hits).",

Simon's observation that coding agents need reliable tool calling that local models can't yet deliver is accurate - but it frames the problem purely as a capability gap.There's a philosophical angle being missed: do we actually want our coding agents making hundreds of tool calls through someone else's infrastructure? The more capable these systems become, the more intimate access they have to our codebases, credentials, and workflows. Every token of context we send to a frontier model is data we've permanently given up control of.I've been working on something addressing this directly - LocalGhost.ai (https://www.localghost.ai/manifesto) - hardware designed around the premise that \"sovereign AI\" isn't just about capability parity but about the principle that your AI should be yours. The manifesto articulates why I think this matters beyond the technical arguments.Simon mentions his next laptop will have 128GB RAM hoping 2026 models close the gap. I'm betting we'll need purpose-built local inference hardware that treats privacy as a first-class constraint, not an afterthought. The YOLO mode section and \"normalization of deviance\" concerns only strengthen this case - running agents in insecure ways becomes less terrifying when \"insecure\" means \"my local machine\" rather than \"the cloud plus whoever's listening.\"The capability gap will close.

The kind of video generation we see might nail realism but if you want to use it to create something meaningful which involves solving a ton of problems and making difficult choices in order to express an idea, you run into the walls of easy work pretty quickly. It's insulting then for professionals to see manga PFPs on X put some slop together and say \"movie industry is cooked!\". It betrays a lack of understanding of what it takes to make something good and it gives off a vibe of \"the loud ones are just trying to force this objectively meh-by-default thing to happen\".The other day there was that dude loudly arguing about some code they wrote/converted even after a woman with significant expertise in the topic pointed out their errors.Gen AI has its promise. But when you look at the lack of ethics from the industry, the cacophony of voices of non experts screaming \"this time it's really doom\", and the weariness/wariness that set in during the crypto cycle, it's a natural tendency that people are going to call snake oil.That said, I think the more accurate representation here is that HN as a whole is calling the hype snake oil. There's very little question anymore about the tools being capable of advanced things. But there is annoyance at proclamations of it being beyond what it really is at the moment which is that it's still at the stage of being an expertise+motivation multiplier for deterministic areas of work. It's not replacing that facet any time soon on its current trend (which could change wildly in 2026). Not until it starts training itself I think. Could be famous last words",

I enabled HDR in firefox by going to about:config and setting the following to true: gfx.wayland.hdr, gfx.wayland.hdr.force-enabled, gfx.webrender.compositor.force-enabled.\nColor look completely washed out.For Chromium 143.0.7499.169 HDR enabled by default. This looks like HDR.I downloaded the HDR video from Youtube and played it using MPV v0.40.0-dirty with settings --vo=gpu-next --gpu-api=vulkan --gpu-context=waylandvk. Without these settings the video seems a little too bright like the Chromium playback. This was the best playback of the three on Linux.On the Blu-ray the HDR is Dolby Vision according to both the TV and the AVR. The AVR is reporting...

Also I think my brightness setting is too high compared to the Blu-ray. I'll play around with it more once the sRGB color setting is fixed.*Edit: Sorry Hacker News has completely changed the format of my text.",

One of the reasons the geforce/radeon drivers (eg, the geforce \"game ready\" branding) are so big is that they carry a whole catalogue of quirk workarounds for when the game renderer is coded badly or to make it a better fit to hardware and lets them advertise +15% performance in a new version.

Apple made M3s and M4s harder to support, so Linux is still playing catch-up on getting those usable.Beyond that, Lunar Lake chips are evidently really really good. The Dell XPS line in particular shows a lot of promise for becoming a strict upgrade or sidegrade to the M2 line within a few years, assuming the haptic touchpad works as well as claimed.

(2) After calling them and getting access to the account, the subscription for the digital newspaper had not been properly set up, and we didn't have access to any newspaper online.

It’s not just “if apple allows alternative browsers then Chrome will win”, which is (probably) true. It’s:* If Apple allows alternative app stores then the whole ios ecosystem will rot and be foooded with malware, brough up during the Apple vs. Epic cases* If Apple can’t control the data on their user’s phones, then privacy rights will disappear, a common talking point during the Apple vs. Facebook case for opt-in data collection.And like, these points are correct — Apple kind of acts like a “benevolent dictator” when it comes to their ecosystem. But shouldn’t there be alternatives between “Apple can control all software on the hardware they sell” and “the moment Apple doesn’t have control of their user’s experience then it’ll be far worse”? Like, we should have more tech companies, more options to pick from between these two extremes. The market needs to be more competitive, and if that isn’t possible shouldn’t there be regulation to protect users and devs better? This constantly feels like a “pick your poison“ kind of deal, where we can only pick between a company locking down their hardware or abuse of users via. software. If Microsoft banned alternative browser engines there’d be riots in these comments. Apple is just better to its users.Giving companies the power to lock down hardware they sell isn’t a solution that will work when Apple inevitably turns against its users, and is a horrible precedent to set legally. Lord knows John Deere and a million other predatory hardware companies are salivating at the idea of users of their hardware not having control over what they bought, and Meta and Microsoft love the idea of users not having control of the software they run and the data it collects.

Not just because of the lack of customer base for paid apps, that hurts too, but because the APIs aren't there, and because you can't hack on the private APIs or the hardware directly...they won't be. The app store on Vision Pro is filled with half-assed \"spatial computing\" consumption apps (Wow, I can put the stock tickers on the wall! That I can only see with these huge goggles on! Neat!), \"showroom\" apps that are just pure consumption, mostly 3D models of products, and media consumption apps. The games that exist are all pretty lame, and you can't enjoy any of the backcatalog of games written for VR because A. They'd never pass app review, and B. you can only use the PSVR controllers with it, so my Index controllers that I already have are useless.The Vision Pro demands being as open as the Mac. The problem space is too ill defined and the hardware too packed with interesting use cases to gate behind the restrictive App Store rules. The iPad model worked because it was 2010 and had all the upward momentum of the iPhone to ride. Here and now, on a stagnant, occupied app market where room for innovation is small, on a device with far less promise, the App Store restrictions take all the air out of the room. The entire device is suffocated by Apple's iron grip and belief that they are entitled to own any good ideas that happen on the device, and that they are entitled to 15-30% of any economic exchange happening on the device. Just an utterly kneecapped platform right out of the gate, pricing, specs, weight, and everything else aside. There are no good apps because you just can't write the sort of apps your imagination is likely to want to make. Hell, accessing the main camera wasn't allowed until visionOS 2.0, and you have to use the \"enterprise apps\" API/entitlement to access it.Apple's grip has killed it.

The hardest thing about not working is the social life that work gives you. Whilst we may think that work is for money, it is also for 1) filling our time, and 2) spending time with people. Yes, some people are definitely a net-negative interaction, but most people are actually positive to one’s day, but in one of those “you need to not work for a year to know it” way.Amongst other reflections I have:1) a pay-check does give you a sense of validation. This took some getting through2) it’s been challenging working out what I will actually end up doing with myself. There were periods where I put more pressure on myself to do so. I still don’t know what will do.3) the process of doing things because they are fun takes some getting used to when one’s entire life was built around doing something useful to others4) when one lives off of savings it’s almost easier to spend as it feels like you didn’t suffer for it. Getting depressed at work makes it easier to spend more money outside of work5) the “number” people need to retire (or not work for extended periods) is probably less than people realise6) not working in finance (amongst all the moral corruption everywhere) has generally made me happier in part because I can live in a way which is more in-keeping with my values over having constantly breach them for work reasons7) owning my calendar is a big freedom. I don’t have to ask a boss if I can do something all the time. No need to explain yourself.8) not constantly having to submit to a boss is huge. One can really grow this way, as constant repression to other people’s whims is soul crushing and shows just how close employment is to slavery (especially in finance with golden handcuffs)",

The most important part that I think people get wrong in general is that online friends, or your good friends from uni or your childhood youth that you only see in person once or twice a year, can't replace an active local friends group - or community as he calls it.\nCutting the daily interactions with other humans by no longer going to an office every day made me realize that - because you very quickly feel that something is missing.",

My partner is slightly more social than me and gets out slightly more than I do, but generally we are homebodies and we like it that way.Other people (at least in this country) are generally emotionally messy, unwilling to tolerate people with radically different views/values, and either intellectually lacking or overly predictable in their interests. The few times I find a candidate who isn’t like this, they usually have some kind of personality disorder that makes them too unstable for long-term friendship. When I was younger I often looked past this, but there’s only so many times you are willing to let a human wrecking ball into your life.A good book is almost always better. The life of a deep reader and casual hobbyist is rich and fulfilling if your romantic needs are satisfied at home. I do not miss my former social life at all.Just leaving this out there for any other wayward souls who may be annoyed by the conversation.",

But like a previous poster stated, connections like these are fleeting and take a lot of work to maintain (especially if you're a man, which I am; see the end of this post for more on that).Consequently, the process of meeting people eventually became very same-y after a short while, and knowing that these conversations usually won't amount to anything other than nice, fleeting moments got old.There was also the drama of managing \"interesting\" personalities in a free Meetup group. I passed the baton in 2012 or so, but that's another post for another day.I'll conclude this post with some unsolicited advice: try to learn what people do for work without asking them directly.EVERYONE expects this question, and it can be a conversation killer if your occupations don't intersect (less likely) or if the person you're conversing with hates their job (more likely). Everyone ALSO loves talking about themselves. Finding out how someone spends the largest part of their day without asking point-blank adds interesting twists and turns that can really liven up a conversation. It also makes you a better listener and better at asking questions.I lied; I have more unsolicited advice. The easiest way to give a shit about what someone does for work is to ask lots of questions! Unless they hate their job, in which case, you'll want to ask questions that get them talking about what they do enjoy!Typing that last paragraph reminded me of another reason why I got burned out on socializing with people. I'm a man. Most men only like sports and video games; two things I couldn't care less about. Socializing with other men as a man who dislikes these things is extremely difficult, especially in the US South, where I live.

You'll shortly start seeing the same people regularly, even if it's just the staff.Then you can greet those people, introduce yourself, and talk with them. By asking questions about their day, their plans, and sharing the same about yourself, you'll open the door to expanding your social life outside of those locations, hours, and people.Community doesn't need to be a series of planned events and invitations. It can be implicit and organic just by virtue of regularly sharing space.Personal anecdote:I do this with pinball. Sure, it's often in bars, but it's a great way to be at a bar without having to drink. Pinball players are happy to talk about pinball (or anything really), it provides an instant topic of conversation, and it's easy to invite another player to a game because it's such a short commitment. And if no one's around that you want to talk to, or you don't feel like focusing on socializing, you can just play the game while still maintaining your regular schedule.If you want to try following in my exact footsteps, you can use Pinball Map[1] to find locations near you.

After pulling back from social activity, I've felt so much healthier, happier and optimistic about life.I get the same exact phone calls as you're describing, and I generally weigh the events I'm being invited to with what the focus of the event is - if the goal of the event is to just get together at a bar, I don't go. I think many of my friends feel that I've lost my way, but it's difficult because I sort of see them in the same light.What I do hope to do eventually is to cultivate some new friendships, because I am missing that social aspect of my life, but for now I've sort of got a good thing going and I'm not too concerned about rushing it into being.",

It went up for sale in December 2024.The whole experience was wonderful. I had basically none of the problems that this fellow experienced with his publisher, and I am delighted about how it went.I did some things differently. For one, I had already been selling the book on my own for a few years, and was essentially on the 3rd self-published edition.  Because of this, they were able to see what the almost-finished product was.I told them I would not make massive changes to the book, nor would I contort it to the AI trend (the book barely mentions AI at all), and they never pressured me once.Their biggest contribution was their team of editors. This book has code on just about every page. I had 3 technical editors go through it, finding many bugs. How many? Let's just say \"plenty\".And the feedback from the non-technical editors was, to my surprise, even more valuable. Holy crap, I cannot express to you how much they improved the book. There were several of these folks (I had no idea there were so many different specialties for editors), and all of them were great.(They also accepted my viewpoint when I disagreed with them, immediately, every time. The final published version of the book was 100% my own words.)From all of that, I made improvements on what must have been almost every page, and rewrote two chapters from scratch. I also added a new chapter (I volunteered for it, no one at any point pressured me to do that). The result was making a book that IMO is at least twice as good as what I was able to accomplish on my own.I do not resonate with the article author's comments about compensation. He negotiated a pretty good deal, I think; it's not realistic to get much better than what he did, since the publisher is a business with their own expenses to pay, etc.I was pretty disciplined about meeting deadlines that we agreed to for certain milestones. That helped my relationship with the publisher, obviously.All in all, it was a great experience, and I am glad I did it this way.Reading the article, it sounds like my publisher (oreilly) was better to work with than his, but I think he could have done some things differently also.

Like Austin's book it contains a CHIP8 chapter and a couple chapters on making a programming language. The difference with regards to his experience and my experience in writing it with a traditional publisher, is that I was an experienced author so I felt comfortable finishing the entire book first before shopping it around to publishers. I didn't want too much scrutiny around the core concept and I was getting similar signals of \"every chapter must have AI.\"I wrote a similar blog post a month ago describing the process of creating the book and getting it published called \"Writing Computer Science from Scratch\":https://www.observationalhazard.com/2025/12/writing-computer...Some in this thread have wondered what publisher Austin was working with. Based on my experience working with three different technical publishers and the setup and terms Austin was offered, my educated guess would be Manning.I will critique the blog post a little bit. It's presented as a critique of the experience of working with the publisher, but ultimately I'm reading between the lines that the book failed because he was missing deadlines. He wrote that \"life got in the way\" and I think he lost his motivation only partially because the publisher wanted AI in more of the book. Many of the trials he had along the way: dealing with a development editor who wants to tailor your style to a particular audience, a technical editor who needs a couple chapters to warmup, back and forth on the proposal, etc. these are all really par for the course when writing a technical book. Ultimately you have to be self-motivated to finish because of course the development editor, technical editor, etc are going to disagree with you from time to time and try to push you in different directions. If that alone is so demotivating to you, it's just not for you to work with a publisher.PS I think his blog is really good and he should think about self publishing under a time frame and terms he is more comfortable with.",

It took many months of negotiating to finalize the agreement and then they wanted the manuscript in ~7 months from contract signing.

It's easier than ever to go direct, in my case because I had a niche book and I wasn't doing it for money, I valued the prestige (or perceived prestige anyways) of having a book with a name brand publisher as I thought it'd be more helpful for my career in other ways, and candidly was mostly a passion project that I didn't feel strongly about monetizing!If any folks want to talk about nonfiction publishing, I'm always happy to chat as many people were incredibly generous with their time for me and I'd like to try to pay it forward.",

I used to get very annoyed and think \"didn't you pay attention! We covered that!\" But then I realized: If I can make this easy to understand by a fairly non-technical editor at a first pass, it absolutely will make this book better for the reader.Publishers have a lot of experience publishing books, so I've learned that their advice is often not bad.There was also plenty of advice from the editors I vehemently didn't agree with, so I pushed back and quickly realized: publishers need you more than you need them, so very often you do get final say.But you still have to actually write the book. Book writing is hard, and a much more complex process than writing blog posts.

The real value of having written a book is that then you have written a book.Having a publisher carries one extra benefit that was merely implied in the post: you get assigned a professional editor. If you're lucky (I was), the editor has a really good understanding of how to wield language and the lessons you get from the editing process are going to far outweigh any direct financial benefits. When I wrote mine, I had been doing freelance writing for a large IT magazine for nearly ten years - and as a direct result had been taught how to use written language as a weapon by a good number of old-guard journalists. The year I spent on the book project taught me a LOT more still, because I was assigned an editor who herself was studying (in a university) to become a language teacher.The skills I picked up from that process are with me to this day, and ironically have been the single most valuable asset I have as an engineer and/or engineering leader. Being able to write well to a varying audience is a superpower. You also learn to appreciate professional authors, because what they do is decidedly not easy.In the end my book sold well enough to earn out its advance, so I guess it was a non-failure for the publisher as well.

In other words, VHS \"won\".Most people have heard the above version but Betamax was widely adopter in TV news. The reason being that news preferred shorter, higher quality video for news segments as they rarely lasted more than 5-10 minutes.My point being, the market is BIG and is really made up of many \"mini-markets\". I can see folks who are doing work on projects with big downside risk (e.g. finance, rockets etc) wanting to have code that is tested, reviewed etc. People needing one off code probably don't care if the failure rate is high especially if failure cases are obvious and the downside risk is low.",

Diet - Making sure you are consuming enough protein in your diet, approximately 1gram/pound of body weight...or near it or even best you can.  Total calories consumed a day should match any online calculator for your age and activity level.\n3. Sleep! \n4. Sleep!\n5. Vary your workout - some weeks high reps low weight and some weeks low reps high weight.  Why?  Never let your body know what you're doing and shock it as best you can.  Always try to exert yourself enough to be sore within 48 hours of a workout.Now multiply this over a few years.Stop reading these studies thinking there is some optimal way!

There are lots of macho powerlifters out there with permanently ruined spines who will probably die earlier than they would have otherwise, due to mobility degradation.Particularly as you get older you become more injury prone and your recovery time slows down. This necessitates being cautious about how quickly you increase weight and how often you go to failure.The better goal to target is increasing volume, where volume is defined as Sets x Reps x Weight. The literature doesn't conclusively establish that any one of these is \"more important\" than the others for hypertrophy.

          "content": "I find the goal of perpetual progress in resistance training strange.  Yet it seems to be almost universal.  If you are not lifting more today than you lifted yesterday, you are a failure.  Gains, gains, gains.  It is rather obvious that there are genetic limits on strength and size.  Everyone is somewhere on their own spectrum of potential.  Someone who doesn’t resistance train at all is likely near the bottom of their potential.  Someone who works out 5 days a week, never misses leg day, eats enough protein (1g per kg in Europe, 1g per lb in the US) is likely near the top of their potential.  Living in higher and higher ranges of your potential requires exponentially more ongoing effort, dedication/discipline/sacrifice, blood/sweat/tears/pain.  Say my absolute maximum genetic potential in exercise X is to lift 100kg.  Say I never do exercise X, so my current maximum is 40k.  With some effort, like training 3 days a week for 4 months, I might get this to 60kg.  Perhaps I could maintain that gain for decades by continuing to train 2 days a week.  Or, I could keep pushing and maybe I could get it to 80kg in a few years.  With an absolute all out effort, applying all the knowledge of the latest studies and perfect discipline, I could temporarily push it into the high 90s.  Everybody can do what they want to do, but it seems to me that seeking the minimum effective dose of resistance training to look and feel good, and be strong enough to do what you like or need to do, is a reasonable approach.

Especially since athletes in almost every sport don't even care about hypertrophy - unless you talk about pro bodybuilding. And there you have tons of pharmacological interventions, so it's not really easy to paint a picture either. I don't know a single good study performed on a significant set of tested natural bodybuilders regarding hypertrophy.Studies like this are also aimed at couch potatoes, because that is the normal population, so the results will be applicable to most people, which in turn is important when you want to get funding for your research. In that sense it also doesn't matter that these people will not have reached their full neuromuscular connection compared to actual weightlifters, because most people haven't either. So the results are still relevant. Usually when scientists sell this kind of research to grant departments, they try to provide a benefit to geriatric or otherwise medically impaired people, so that existing treatments may be improved. Studying muscle building itself just for the sake of it in gymbros is not a good strategy unless you want to spend your own money. And this stuff quickly gets very expensive if you want to do it right.",

If you can stand the boredom do the exact same program for a year.

People who care about results and progression/growth should be progressing from 5 up to 20 hard sets per muscle per week across the span of a few years. (Compounds hit multiple, so it's not necessarily 20 hard times the number of muscles!) What's \"hard\"? in the 0-2 RIR range, ideally some to failure. Most people do not know what 0RIR is until they actually go to failure on a weight, compute their 1RM and start to use the computed reps/weight load. For many people \"0 RIR\" is actually 3+ RIR because they stop themselves short. This is why I mostly only trust studies that take people to true failure (either an inability to move the weight any more, or a coach saying the person significantly broke form and must stop)For advanced, as i understand it, they need to focus on weekly periodization like hitting 3RIR, 2RIR, 1RIR, 0RIR (test new 1RM), Recovery week kind of cycles.

In general, Americans (including those who work in US manufacturing) do not understand that Chinese vehicles are very competitive. At some point, those vehicles are likely to surpass domestic capabilities (they are already there viewed through a price/performance lens).All of this is down to the simple fact that essentially no American has ever driven a Chinese vehicle and does not know anybody who has. They are not even getting secondhand reports. This is worse than the '80s when the Japanese makers arrived in the sense that in the '80s everybody could see the quality of the Toyotas and assess quality/performance for themselves. It's much worse to not even know how good the competition is.From a business standpoint, it's especially bad for the domestic industry because the majors actually do need to be competitive in fast-growing regions like Latin America, Asia, and Africa. It's not a viable strategy to depend on protectionism at home while ceding countries where most people live.",

Zooming out, as a response to Trump's 1st term tariffs China went on a big autarky push by redirecting its citizens' and companies' deposits into a loan bazooka for the industrial sector. We are now seeing the fruits of that. The big questions have to do with (true) profitability and (true) balance sheets: can the new industries service their debts well enough for the government to hold face?",

      "abstract": "该帖子讨论了名为“Rust--”的项目，其核心是探索禁用Rust语言的所有权借用检查器后的可能性。社区对此反应不一，部分用户从技术角度提出质疑：有人认为禁用检查器可能导致未定义行为，因为编译器优化依赖于借用检查的假设；也有用户指出内存管理可能变得模糊，引发内存泄漏或释放后使用等问题。讨论中提到，该项目最初带有讽刺性质，是对Rust严格所有权规则的一种调侃。有用户认为这或许可作为快速原型开发的编译选项，但强调不应用于生产环境。尽管存在分歧，不少用户认同借用检查器本身有助于编写更健壮的代码，而真正令人困扰的往往是生命周期标注的复杂性。整体上，社区普遍视此项目为趣味实验，而非严肃的技术方案。",

Obviously I didn't think that just by tinkering with a compiler, I'd get personally attacked, but anyway, fair enough.For those of you confused: yes, this started as a satirical project with the corroded lib. Then I thought \"why not just remove the borrow checker?\" without any real motivation. Then I just went ahead and did it. To my surprise, it was really simple and easy. I thought it would be heavily tangled into the rustc compiler, but once I figured out where the error emitter is, it was pretty straightforward.I'm not sure about my long-term goals, but besides the joke, I genuinely think for debugging and prototyping purposes, I'd like the borrow checker to shut up. I'm the kind of guy that prints everything while debugging and prototyping. Maybe you're using a debugger, okay, but I don't. I don't like debuggers. It's just more convenient for me. So what constantly happens is I run into issues like: does this implement Debug? Can I print this after it moved? The borrow checker won't let me access this because of some other borrow. Stuff like that.Another point is, as you guys are well aware, the borrow checker will reject some valid programs in order to never pass any invalid program. What if I'm sure about what I'm doing and I don't want that check to run?In the repo there's a doubly linked list example. Without the borrow checker it's fairly simple and easy to implement. With it, you know how complicated and ugly it gets.Anyway, have a good new year, and don't get angry over compilers, you know.",

The examples at the beginning of the article show this - they'll execute correctly. The borrow checker is quite conservative, and rules out all sorts of code that won't (normally!) cause runtime errors.It's fairly easy to see this if you think about the core of Rust's ownership model: every value in Rust has a single owner. The compiler enforces that for any value, there's either one mutable reference or any number of immutable references to it at a time.This model has the advantage of being simple, easy to reason about, and ruling out large classes of errors. But like most static checks, including e.g. traditional type checks, it also rules out a great deal of otherwise valid code.It's easy to think of examples in which you have multiple mutable references to a value that won't cause errors. Aside from trivial examples like in the article, in C-like languages you can have many concurrent mutable references to the same mutable value. You can safely (with some caveats) manage access to it via locks, protocols, documentation, or just being careful. Rust with the borrow checker simply doesn't allow multiple concurrent mutable references to the same value to exist. Rust without the borrow checker, as in the article, would allow this.",

Of course, if you're wrong, that means your program will blow up, but at least you know that the culprit is hiding in one of those unsafe areas, rather than literally anywhere in the whole codebase.Alternately, you can switch to a language with a different ethos.The ethos of Rust is caring for memory safety so much that you willingly limit yourself in terms of what kind of code you write and you only step out of those limits reluctantly and with great care.

But the Russian government does it because they don't care about their people and also the rest of the world is too toothless to do anything about it (until this occurrence at least, go Finland - but then they know Russia's tactics very well).Russia has been doing a \"stop hitting yourself, stop hitting yourself\" to the world for too long, abusing the \"nice\" way we desperately try to see things, pretending even when it's obvious. Like they'll do something egregious and then when the West calls them out, suddenly their political mouthpieces are all \"we can't believe that the West is making this shocking and provocative accusation which is of course completely false, EU are bullies!\" and then the world responds by taking a step back, pretty much every single time.",

At one of the talks those folks they said it's basically a black box of trying to get what kind of science the regulators will consider acceptable.As you might guess, making sure the food waste you feed the insects doesn't have _any_ animal proteins in it is quite logistically challenging and so afaik nobody is doing that at a large scale.I did quite a bit of research into the history of insects in the food system, especially in the Netherlands. While I was rooting for Ynsect and other big players to figure something good out I believe that it's a problem much better suited to a smaller scale (perhaps on the city level). Basically, have the food waste from various stores brought to a facility to be fed to insects and then let those insects be turned into whatever (pet food, fish food, trendy protein bars).",

      "abstract": "该讨论围绕一篇题为“摧毁所有网站的网站”的文章展开，核心话题是探讨个人独立网站能否替代中心化社交平台，以及开放网络面临的现实挑战。  \n\n有人认为独立网站能带来更自由、个性化的网络体验，用户可借助RSS、自建站点等方式摆脱算法控制。也有用户指出，中心化平台之所以盛行，是因为它们解决了内容发布、分发和维护的实际难题，个人网站难以替代其规模与便利性。讨论中提到，独立网站面临技术门槛、恶意攻击风险以及内容发现机制缺失等问题，普通用户可能无法承受长期维护成本。  \n\n社区普遍认同开放网络的价值和独立网站的审美意义，但在可行性上存在分歧：一方强调自主权与去中心化的必要性，另一方则认为现有中心化模式是系统复杂性下的自然结果，单纯怀旧或抵制广告无法改变现状。",

Complaints about everything the designer did to make this site unique and personal, which was the entire point of the exercise.

Unless we understand how those complex systems work, we cannot change anything. We end up with cargo cult thinking. You need to understand the function that produces the result.Why does the internet function the way it does? It is really pretty simple. The internet is primarily characterized by very-high-volume-very-low-value transactions.How much does it cost to send an email? When I send a real letter, I buy a stamp $0.78. So if I can send an email instead, it will save me a lot of money.  You can try to calculate how many email transactions you can provide on one VPS costing $5.00 per month.Here is a great business opportunity! You sell people email stamps at $0.01 per letter for 10k bytes. Cool. And 1,000,000 people each buy 10 stamps. Wow. That is a lot of money for your $5/month VPS, right?But how do you get the money? You need to find a way for the one million people to each send you a dime. You cannot do it. If they put a dime in envelope and mail it to you, it will cost them $0.78. Etc.So you have another idea. Why not let scammers include details of their scam in all emails send and they pay for the email. Oops, I should have used the term \"advertisers\". Now the people who email pay nothing and the scamm.... oops advertisers pay for the cost.And you surprisingly find many, many people and corporations from all over the world are eager to exploit, oops target with advertising users.

Loud, low-effort content often masquerades as significance, while quiet, honest, and carefully produced work is overlooked.

By all accounts, Mixer was more technologically advanced than Twitch is right now, and Mixer died 5 years ago.Even Valve of all people made a streaming apparatus that was more advanced than Twitch's which had then innovative features such letting you rewind with visible categories and automated replays of moments of heightened chat activity, and even synchronized metadata such as in-game stats - and they did it as a side thing for CSGO and Dota 2. That got reworked in the streaming framework Steam has now which is only really used by Remote play and annoying publisher streams above games, so basically nothing came of it.That's how it always goes. Twitch lags and adds useless fake engagement fluff like bits and thrives, while competitors try their damnest and neither find any success nor do they have a positive impact anywhere. The one sitting at the throne gets to pick what tech stack improvements are done, and if they don't feel like it, well, though luck, rough love.",

If you’re in a situation where you feel losing weight is hopeless, I strongly encourage you to consider these medications. It could change your life for the better, in strange ways you might not expect.

Surely he knows what an anomaly London is? It's not representative of anything except itself.Referencing the extreme wage dispersion and severe housing pressure of London in a rant about Europe in general is a completely pointless endeavour.He did say one thing I agree with. If you like good food, rich culture and great surroundings, \"Europe\" is indeed a lovely place to be for the most part.Maybe I'll just keep that as my takeaway.

To that end, I'm curious about this part:> You don’t have to convince the elites or the populace that growth is good or that entrepreneurs could be celebrated. Meanwhile in Europe, perhaps 15 percent of the electorate actively believes in degrowth. I feel it’s impossible to convince Europeans to act in their self interest.Can someone elaborate on how growth is aligned with the general interest? To my mind, although growth could _theoretically_ lead to a \"lifting all boats\" improvement across the board, in practice it inevitably leads to greater concentration of wealth for the elite while the populace deals with negative externalities like pollution, congestion, and advertizing. Degrowth, on the other hand, would directly reduce those externalities; and, if imposed via progressive taxation, would have further societal benefits via funded programs.I'd very much like to hear the counter-argument. It would be pleasant and convenient to believe that growth and industry are Good, Actually, so that I needn't feel guilty for contributing to them or for furthering my own position - but (sadly!)

In Dan's article;>A rule of thumb is that it takes five years from an American, German, or Japanese automaker to dream up a new car design and launch that model on the roads; in China, it’s closer to 18 months.Not only is China 3 - 5 times faster in terms of product launches, they would have launch it with a production scale that is at least double the output of other auto marker. If you were to put capacity into the equation as well, China is an order of magnitude faster than any competing countries, at half the cost if not even lower.Every single year since 2022 China has added more solar power capacity than the entire US solar capacity. And they are still accelerating, with the current roadmap and trend they could install double the entire US solar power capacity in a single year by 2030.CATL's Sodium Ion Battery is already in production and will be used by EVs and large scale energy storage by end of this year. The cost advantage of these new EV would mean there is partially zero chance EU can compete. And if EU are moaning about it now, they cant even imagine what is coming.Thanks to AI pushing up memory and NAND price. YMTC and CXMT now have enough breathing room to catch up. If they play this right, I wont be surprised by 2035 30 - 40% of DRAM and NAND will be made by the two Chinese firms. Although judging from their past execution record I highly doubt this will happen, but expect may be 10-15% maximum.Beyond tech, there are also other part of manufacturing that China has matched or exceeded rest of the world without being noticed by many. Lab Grown Diamond, Cosmetic Production, Agricultural Machinery, Reinforced glass etc. Their 10 years plan on agricultural improvement also come to fruition especially in terms of fruit and veg. I wont be surprised if they no long need US soy bean within 10 years time.All in all a lot of things in China has passed escape velocity and there is no turning back. China understand US better than US understand themselves, and US doesn't even have any idea about China. I think the quote from the article sums this up pretty well.\"Beijing has been preparing for Cold War without eagerness for waging it, while the US wants to wage a Cold War without preparing for it.\".[1] https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46273326",

Anyone in the world can already get cheap, mass-produced software to do almost anything they want their computer to do. Compilers spit out new build of any program on demand within seconds, and you can usually get both source code and pre-compiled copies over the internet. The \"industrial process\" (as TFA puts it) of production and distribution is already handled perfectly well by CI/CD systems and CDNs.What software developers actually do is closer to the role of an architect in construction or a design engineer in manufacturing. They design new blueprints for the compilers to churn out. Like any design job, this needs some actual taste and insight into the particular circumstances. That has always been the difficult part of commercial software production and LLMs generally don't help with that.It's like thinking the greatest barrier to producing the next great Russian literary novel is not speaking Russian. That is merely the first and easiest barrier, but after learning the language you are still no Tolstoy.",

If you look from first principles, it's clear that physical goods and software don't share the same properties and thus the analogy falls apart.Physical goods like clothes or cars have variable costs. The marginal unit always costs > 0, and thus the price to the consumer is always greater than zero. Industrialization lowered this variable cost, while simultaneously increasing production capacity, and thus enabled a new segment of \"low cost, high volume\" products, but it does not eliminate the variable cost. This variable cost (eg. the cost of a hand made suit) is the \"umbrella\" under which a low cost variant (factory made clothes) has space to enter the market.Digital goods have zero marginal cost. Many digital goods do not cost anything at all to the consumer! Or they are as cheap as possible to actively maximize users because their costs are effectively fixed. What is the \"low value / low cost\" version of Google? or Netflix for that matter? This is non-sensical because there's no space for a low cost entrant to play in when the price is already free.In digital goods, consumers tend to choose on quality because price is just not that relevant of a dimension. You see this in the market structure of digital goods. They tend to be winner (or few) take all because the best good can serve everyone. That is a direct result of zero marginal cost.Even if you accept the premise that AI will make software \"industrialized\" and thus cheaper to produce, it doesn't change the fact that most software is already free or dirt cheap.The version of this that might make sense is software that is too expensive to make at all because the market size (eg. number of consumers * price they would pay) is less than the cost of the software developer / entrpreneurs time. But by definition those are small markets, and not anything like the huge markets that were enabled by physical good industrialization.",

          "content": "Glad this submission is finally receiving upvotes.This was just shown at the 39C3 in Hamburg, few days back.Common (unpached) Bluetooth headsets using Airoha's SoCs can be completely taken over by any unauthenticated bystander with a Linux laptop. (CVE-2025-20700, CVE-2025-20701, CVE-2025-20702)This includes firmware dumps, user preferences, Bluetooth Classic session keys, current playing track, ...> Examples of affected vendors and devices are Sony (e.g., WH1000-XM5, WH1000-XM6, WF-1000XM5), Marshall (e.g. Major V, Minor IV), Beyerdynamic (e.g. AMIRON 300), or Jabra (e.g. Elite 8 Active).Most vendors gave the security researchers either silent treatment or were slow, even after Airoha published fixes. Jabra was one of the positive outlier, Sony unfortunately negatively.What is exciting, even though the flaws are awful, that it is unlikely for current generation of those Airoha bluetooth headsets to change away from Aiorha's Bluetooth LE \"RACE\" protocol. This means there is great opportunity for Linux users to control their Bluetooth headsets, which for example is quite nice in an office setting to toggle \"hearthrough\" when toggling volume \"mute\" on your machine.RACE Reverse Engineered - CLI Tool: https://github.com/auracast-research/race-toolkitI feel like this should receive state-level attention, the remote audio surveillance of any headset can be a major threat. I wonder what the policies in countries official buildings are when it comes to Bluetooth audio devices, considering that Jabra is a major brand for conference speakers, I'd assume some actual espionage threats.",

          "content_cn": "很高兴这个提交终于获得赞同。几天前，这刚刚在汉堡的39C3大会上展示。使用Airoha芯片的常见（未打补丁）蓝牙耳机可以被任何拥有Linux笔记本电脑的未认证旁观者完全接管。（CVE-2025-20700、CVE-2025-20701、CVE-2025-20702）这包括固件转储、用户偏好设置、蓝牙经典会话密钥、当前播放曲目等。受影响厂商和设备的例子有索尼（如WH1000-XM5、WH1000-XM6、WF-1000XM5）、Marshall（如Major V、Minor IV）、Beyerdynamic（如AMIRON 300）或Jabra（如Elite 8 Active）。大多数厂商对安全研究人员要么保持沉默，要么反应迟缓，即使在Airoha发布修复程序后也是如此。Jabra是少数积极应对的厂商之一，索尼则令人遗憾地表现消极。令人兴奋的是，尽管这些漏洞很糟糕，但当前这一代使用Airoha芯片的蓝牙耳机不太可能放弃Airoha的蓝牙低功耗“RACE”协议。这意味着Linux用户有很大机会控制他们的蓝牙耳机，例如在办公室环境中，当在电脑上切换“静音”时，可以方便地切换“通透模式”。RACE逆向工程——CLI工具：https://github.com/auracast-research/race-toolkit我认为这应该引起国家层面的关注，任何耳机的远程音频监控都可能构成重大威胁。我想知道各国官方建筑在蓝牙音频设备方面的政策是怎样的，考虑到……"

          "content": "I didn't see a summary in here so based on my reading:  * Certain headset devices from varying vendors have crappy BT security over both bluetooth classic and BLE\n  * They implement a custom protocol called RACE which can do certain things with no authentication at all\n  * One of the things RACE lets you do is read arbitrary memory and exfiltrate keys needed to impersonate the vulnerable device with your already-paired phone\n  * Once you're impersonating the vulnerable device you can do all sorts of things on the paired phone like place/accept calls, listen on the microphone, etc.\n\nThis is pretty bad and you can easily see this being used to bypass other layers of auth like SMS verification or \"have a robot call me and read me a code.\"  It also makes me wonder if a spoofed device could appear as a HID device (e.g. a keyboard), but it's unclear whether the link key compromise works for new device classes.So the way to mitigate this is to be certain you don't have one of the vulnerable peripherals or to disable BT.  Note that the list of device models sounds *far* from complete because it's a chipset issue.  Which makes me wonder if there are cars out there using this chipset and exposing the same vulns.  I'd be very interested if anyone has a source on whether any cars use these chipsets.",

I don’t have data on that, it’s just a hunch.Many of us in the indie music industry (hip hop sustained record plants for many years, arguably until independent music started pressing in the 2000s) have mixed feelings about records.

Ironically as an older fart myself, who once owned numerous records (\"vinyls\" is a newer term), and later cassettes, and later CDs, I guess I eventually decided I'd had enough authenticity and converted the whole lot to MP3s and stuck with that when streaming came around.

I feel I can explain myself though, or at least offer context about why I own about a dozen records and no way whatsoever to play them.I’m a recovering audiophile. I got into the hobby because I enjoy technology in its myriad aspects, and had discovered that good speakers can make things sound better. As I began accruing CDs and re-ripping into lossless audio, I also began collecting vinyls via Record Store Day events of bands or artists I found interesting at the time, or the odd Collector’s Edition bundles of albums or games. The thinking was that when I finally settled into my own place, I could invest into some Hi-Fi kit to play them back.Well, I fell out of the audiophile sphere when I got into data analysis, physics, human biology, and psychology: I had become inoculated against the bullshit that permeates the space, but still recognized the value of my album collection. I’d also pivoted into preservation, and so I began accepting relatives’ collections of older formats, like 78s. I still lacked playback mechanisms, though I now had the space and budget - just more pressing projects than a record playback setup.And so here I am in 2025, in an apartment that transmits energy between units, with an upstairs neighbor that does somersaults and tumbles all day (thus shaking the space slightly). The cost of everything has skyrocketed, but it’s no longer a matter of a turntable and a phono stage to get going (need isolation as well, and that ain’t cheap). I’ve also - shockingly - got other, more pressing projects in front of me, one of which is a bedroom Hi-Fi setup that has physical controls for music streaming instead of smartphone apps - again, not remotely cheap.Right now, my meager collection sits in a crate under the sofa, languishing.

I find physical media annoying, they take up space and require more effort to use them. All those CDs became more of a burden. I guess it's because I grew up with cassette tapes, portable tape players, then CDs, then Discman, then Discman with buffering.

I also care more about the music than the packaging -- if I want something nice on the wall, I would get a painting, litho, etc. instead.The only thing I really miss is old-school music discovery. Reading reviews, then going to a record shop, listening a stack of records to decide, talking to record shop owners and friends for scoops, etc. was so much more fun than letting algorithms do recommendations.

They now frequent local record stores and invest in physical media like vinyl specifically because it forces intentional choice.There really is nothing as good as finding an amazing album you didn't expect, and there's nothing as crushing as realizing the album you just bought based on one song only has that one good song on it (any album by The Police, I'm looking at you).",

A few Internet sources say that RevenueCat has about 120 employees.  I'm in a completely different field so I'm not going to claim to understand all of that but I have worked for 2 startups.The author talks about himself and his co-founder Jacob and they went back and forth on whether to sell or not.I am very interested in what the other 118 employees thought.  Did they want the co-founders to sell?  What was their equity in the company?  What kind of deal would they get?  Accelerated vesting?  Much larger than normal RSU stock grant at the acquiring company compared to a normal new hire there?  Nothing?I post this link in many threads about startups about how the normal employees often get nothing.  The author says \"So we decided to raise another round\" and I wonder if the co-founders share the liquidation preferences and captables with the other 118 employees.https://www.reddit.com/r/startups/comments/a8f6xz/why_didnt_...I posted this comment in a different startup related thread last month but I really wish the CEOs of both startups would have accepted these lower offers.I don't know what the captable was at the first startup but at the second I would have got around $300K.  This would have been a large amount of money for me but the founders wanted more so they rejected the offer.Almost every \"normal\" level employee thought we should have taken the deal and then we would have also gotten jobs with normal RSU grants and bonuses at the acquiring company which was a well established company.It made me decide to never work at a startup again.  I don't want a single person to be able to control my financial situation that much.  I'd rather have the relatively guaranteed yearly raise, bonus, and RSU grant, and not have to drink the Kool-Aid of the founders.> I worked at 2 startups. Both failed.> The first had been around for about 4 years when I joined and had products that made money. They were trying to get acquired. They had partnered with 2 companies making products specifically for them. One of them offered to buy the company for $30 million but the founders thought their company was worth $300 million. They said no and then money started to run out and people started leaving. In the end the assets were sold for $2 million.> The second startup was created by former coworkers and I joined after it had existed for 4 months. We worked like crazy for the first year and got our prototype out. We had a lot of interest but it took me a while to realize that the 3 founders already had net worths from $5 million to billionaire level. When I heard about offers in the $30 million range they just weren't interested in selling for so little. I left after 3 years and the company floundered another 2 years until they shut it down as people left.",

They can get you to sacrifice your personal / family life and work long hours by dangling the big pay day in front of you.The second startup I worked at let the first 8 employees buy into the company for Class A shares.  These in theory were worth more than the Class B shares I was given.  This later led to some marital issues when one guy invested $100K into the startup based on the founder taking everyone out to dinner and assuring the wives it was a great idea.  Then 3 years later they have turned down 2 possible sales, no exit plan in site, and that $100K would have been useful for the children's tuition who are about to go to college.I write these posts are warnings to people who get excited about the appeal of working for a startup.So I would really love to hear the author talk about what his employees thought about turning down the deal and how much money they would have got.",

The key here is formal power series in non-commuting variables, as pioneered by Marcel-Paul Schützenberger. \"Rational\" corresponds to finite state machines, and \"Algebraic\" corresponds to pushdown automata, the context-free grammars that describe most programming languages.On the other hand, \"Concrete Mathematics\" by Donald Knuth, Oren Patashnik, and Ronald Graham (I never met Oren) popularizes another way to organize numbers: The \"endpoints\" of positive reals are 0/1 and 1/0. Subdivide this interval (any such interval) by taking the center of a/b and c/d as (a+c)/(b+d). Here, the first center is 1/1 = 1. Iterate. Given any number, its coordinates in this system is the sequence of L, R symbols to locate it in successive subdivisions.Any computer scientist should be chomping at the bit here: What is the complexity of the L, R sequence that locates a given number?From this perspective, the natural number \"e\" is one of the simpler numbers known, not lost in the unwashed multitude of \"transcendental\" numbers.Most mathematicians don't know this.

With this choice, the constant ln 2 or its inverse appears in formulae that compute derivatives or integrals.People are brainwashed in school into using the exponential e^x and the hyperbolic logarithm, because this choice was more convenient for symbolic computations done with pen on paper, like in the 19th century.In reality, choosing to have the proportionality factor in the derivative formula as \"1\" instead of \"ln 2\" is a bad choice. The reason is that removing the constant from the derivative formula does not make it disappear, but it moves it into the evaluation of the function and in any application much more evaluations of the functions must be done than computations of derivative or integral formulae.The only case when using e^x may bring simplifications is in symbolic computations with complex exponentials and complex logarithms, which may be needed in the development of mathematical models for some linear systems that can be described by linear systems of ordinary differential equations or of linear equations with partial derivatives.

If you're using a different base b, you generally need to adjust by exp(b) or ln(b), neither of which requires computing or using e itself (instead requiring a function call that's using minimax-generated polynomial coefficients for approximation).The importance of π or 2π is that the natural periodicity of trigonometric functions is 2π or π (for tan/cot). If you're using a different period, you consequently need to multiply or divide by 2π, which means you actually have to use the value of the constant, as opposed to calling a library function with the constant itself.Nevertheless, I would say that despite the fact that you would directly use e only relatively rarely, it is still the more important constant.",

The value itself is not needed for anything. When evaluating e^x or the hyperbolic logarithm you need only ln 2 or its inverse, in order to reduce the argument of the functions to a range where a polynomial approximation can be used to compute the function.Moreover, you can replace any use of e^x with the use of 2^x, which inserts ln(2) constants in various places, (but removes ln 2 from the evaluations of exponentials and logarithms, which results in a net gain).If you use only 2^x, you must know that its derivative is ln(2) * 2^x, and knowing this is enough to get rid of \"e\" anywhere. Even in derivation formulae, in actual applications most of the multiplications with ln 2 can be absorbed in multiplications with other constants, as you normally do not have 2^x expressions that are derived, but 2^(a*x), where you do ln(2)*a at compile time.You start with the formula for the exponential of an imaginary argument, but there the use of \"e\" is just a conventional notation. The transcendental number \"e\" is never used in the evaluation of that formula and also none of the numbers produced by computing an exponential or logarithm of real numbers are involved in that formula.The meaning of that formula is that if you take the expansion series of the exponential function and you replace in it the argument with an imaginary argument you obtain the expansion series for the corresponding trigonometric functions. The number \"e\" is nowhere involved in this.Moreover, I consider that it is far more useful to write that formula in a different way, without any \"e\":1^x = cos(2Pi*x) + i * sin(2Pi*x)This gives the relation between the trigonometric functions with arguments measured in cycles and the unary exponential, whose argument is a real number and whose value is a complex number of absolute value equal to 1, and which describes the unit circle in the complex plane, for increasing arguments.This formula appears more complex only because of using the traditional notation. If you call cos1 and sin1 the functions of period 1, then the formula becomes:1^x = cos1(x) + i * sin1(x)The unary exponential may appear weirder, but only because people are habituated from school with the exponential of imaginary arguments instead of it. None of these 2 functions is weirder than the other and the use of the unary exponential is frequently simpler than of the exponential of imaginary arguments, while also being more accurate (no rounding errors from argument range reduction) and faster to compute.",

Then you can compute the circumference by multiplying with Pi.Except for this conversion from directly measured diameters, one rarely cares about hemicycles, but about cycles.The trigonometric functions with arguments measured in cycles are more accurate and faster to compute. The trigonometric functions with arguments measured in radians have simpler formulae for derivatives and primitives. The conversion factor between radians and cycles is 2Pi, which leads to its ubiquity.While students are taught to use the trigonometric functions with arguments measured in radians, because they are more convenient for some symbolic computations, any angle that is directly measured is never measured in radians, but in fractions of a cycle. The same is true for any angle used by an output actuator. The methods of measurement with the highest precision for any physical  quantity eventually measure some phase angle in cycles. Even the evaluations of the trigonometric functions with angles measured in radians must use an internal conversion between radians and cycles, for argument range reduction.So the use of the 2*Pi constant is unavoidable in almost any modern equipment or computer program, even if many of the uses are implicit and not obvious for whoever does not know the detailed implementations of the standard libraries and of the logic hardware.If trigonometric functions with arguments measured in radians are used anywhere, then conversions between radians in cycles must exist, either explicit conversions or implicit conversions.If only trigonometric functions with arguments measured in cycles are used, then some multiplications with 2Pi or its inverse appear where derivatives or primitives are computed.In any application that uses trigonometric functions millions of multiplications with 2Pi may be done every second. In contrast, a multiplication by Pi could be needed only at most at the rate at which one could measure the diameters of some physical objects for which there would be a reason to want to know their circumference.Because Pi is needed so much more rarely, it is simpler to just have a constant Pi_2 to be used in most cases and for the rare case of computing a circumference from the diameter to use Pi_2*D/2,",

We do AST parsing and block certain joins, and Hacker News has not bricked or overloaded my machine yet--there's actually a lot more bandwidth for people to run expensive queries.As for getting good semantic queries for different domains, one thing Claude can do besides use our embed endpoint to embed arbitrary text as a search vector, is use compositions of centroids (averages) of vectors in our database, as search vectors. Like it can effortlessly average every lesswrong chunk embedding over text mentioning \"optimization\" and search with that. You can actually ask Claude to run an experiment averaging the \"optimization\" vectors from different sources, and see what kind of different queries you get when using them on different sources. Then the fun challenge would be figuring out legible vectors that bridge the gap between these different platform's vectors.

This is particularly so if manuals caution against its use.[...]The presence of a loophole facility usually points to a deficiency in the language proper, revealing that certain things could not be expressed.Wirth's use of loophole most closely aligns with the unchecked casts that the article uses. I don't think exceptions amount to lying to the compiler. They amount more to assuming for sake of contradiction, which is not quite lying (e.g., AFSOC is a valid proof technique, but proofs can be wrong).

It would freeze, at the\nboot menu, which I never had before. Anyway. I installed linuxmint today\nand went on to actually compile a multitude of things from source. I \nfinally finished compiling mesa, xorg-server, ffmpeg, mpv, gtk3 + gtk4 -\nand the prior dependencies (llvm etc...). So I am almost finished finally.I had to invest quite a lot of time hunting for dependencies. Most recent\none was glad2 for libplacebo. Turns out \"pip install glad2\" suffices here.\nBut getting that wasn't so trivial. The project project at pip website was\nvirtually useless; respectively I installed \"pip install glad\" which was \ntoo old. Also took me perhaps one full minute or more to realise it.I am tapping into LFS and BLFS webpage (Linux from scratch), which helps a\nlot but it is not perfect. So much information is not described and people\nhave to know what they are doing. You can say this is fair, as this is more\nfor advanced users. Ok. The problem is ... so many things that compilers do,\nis not well-described; or at the least you can not easily find high quality\ndocumentation. Google search is almost virtually useless now; AI just hallucinates\nand flat out lies to you often. Or tells you things that are trivia and you already\nknow it. We kind of lose quality here. It's as if everything got dumbed down.Meanwhile more and more software is required to build other software. Take\nmesa. Now I need not only LLVM but also the whole spirv-stack. And shaderc. And\nlots more. And also rust - why is rust suddenly such a huge dependency? Why is\nthere such a proliferation of programming languages? Ok, perhaps C and C++ are\nno longer the best language, but WHY is the whole stack constantly expanding?We worship complexity. The compilers also become bigger and bigger.About two days ago I cloned gcc from https://github.com/gcc-mirror/gcc.\nThe .tar.xz sits at 3.8 GB. Granted, regular tarball releases are much\nsmaller, e. g. 15.1.0 tar.xz at 97MB (at https://ftp.gnu.org/gnu/gcc/?C=M;O=D).\nBut still. These things become bigger and bigger. gcc-7.2.0.tar.xz from 9 years ago had a size of 59M. Almost twice the size now in less than 10 years. And\nthat's really just like all the other software too. We ended up worshipping\nmore and more bloat. Nobody cares about size. Now one can say \"this is just\nstatic code\", but this is expanded and it just keeps on getting bigger. Look\nat LLVM. How to compile this beast: https://www.linuxfromscratch.org/blfs/view/svn/general/llvm.... - and this will\nonly get bigger and bigger and bigger.So, back to the \"are compilers your best friend\"? I am not sure. We seem to \nhave the problem of more and more complexity getting in at the same time. And\neveryone seems to think this is no issue. I believe there are issues. Take\nslackware; basically it was a one person maintains it. This may not be the\nprimary reason, but slackware slowed down a lot in the last some years. Perhaps\nmaintaining all of that requires a team of people. Older engineers cared about\nsize due to constraints. Now that the constraints are less important, bloat \nbecame the default.",

You can try and elide some of it with (iirc, its been a couple years) @dynamicMemberLookup, but the compiler often chokes on this, it kills autocomplete, and it explodes compile times because Swift's type checker degrades to exponential far more frequently than other languages, especially when used in practice, such as in SwiftUI.",

It’s ok if this function is slow.3. Make a function which takes in a random seed. It initializes your object and then, in a loop, calls random mutation functions (using a seeded RNG) and then calls check(). 100 iterations is usually a good number.4. Call this in an outer loop, trying lots of seeds.5. If anything fails, print out the failing seed number and crash.

The time after finishing school is more blocky: a few years working in certain places, meeting my wife and having kids. My adult life takes up more calendar time, but less \"experienced time\". My cousin was on a chat last night, explaining that his day is taken up by taking three kids to different schools, then picking them up again. Over and over, but somehow it is one experience. Plenty of people will tell you the same about going to work.By contrast, you remember things in your youth that happened only once, like spraining my ankle at a crossing with a train oncoming (it was less dramatic that it sounds lol), or going to a music festival, or finishing high school.One thing that maybe needs to be talked about is that you can simply relive your life. This works best if you had a good time. So the answer to the question is not just that you should look for new firsts, you can replay some old tapes.I'm lucky enough that I know people from every time in my life. I have a chat group with three other guys that I met when we were 4 years old, over 40 years ago. They sent messages last night. I got a message from my first grade teacher, and my high school English teacher. I have a chat with all my buddies from school, where we exchange messages that are about as mature as when we were teenagers. People I worked with, I keep in touch with.I have an online photo album that is basically the only data I care to have a backup of. Now and again, I flip through it, and I see what I was up to, and have nice thoughts about that.It might sound a bit weird for a mid-40s guy to be so resigned to being old. But I was talking to one of the mentioned buddies from nursery, and I turns out the big milestones have happened already. We already finished school, got jobs, had kids. There's a lot of little things to tick off, but they are little things: visiting various interesting sites, going to some concert, and so on.",

In middle age, “no matter how I try, those years just flow by, like a broken down dam.” For a 5 year old, a year was a fifth of their life, and feels like it. For a 40 year old, it is just another year.I think this explanation is true but incomplete. I believe it's also related to Critical Flicker Fusion Frequency [0], the way I see it, if an organism is smaller it has a higher frequency, it sees more image per second, therefore perception of time is slower. (E.g. a fly sees you moving really slowly). Maybe it's related to the processing time of images, with smaller brains insect can process more of them per second.Maybe humans process more images as children, therefore see the time time going slower.It's been a while I didn't think about this, maybe some studies have been made in the past years.[0] https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flicker_fusion_threshold",

Though one wants to cue the _Doonesbury_ cartoon of the college dean who after being told that his entire Freshman class is taking remedial 051 level _everything_ is running a glorified pre school.Roger Zelazny made much of college education becoming quite a different thing when Samuel Eliot of Harvard made the conceptual leap of dividing education by the college credit hour and allowing customization beyond the rote repetition of previous generations in his wonderful novel _Doorways in the Sand_ --- perhaps that should be extended down on some sort of skills basis? The school I attended after Mississippi did reading with a pair of boxes of Scholastic Reading Assessment (SRA) booklets, which, not understanding that one was supposed to do a two or three at each level and get approval on before moving to the next level, I did _all_ of in a matter of weeks, which left me with nothing to do for the balance of the school year but go to the (meager) elementary school library.",

You can learn new things, travel, take up hobbies, or new careers.> This works, to a point, but there are only so many firsts for you, and chasing this exclusively seems to lead to resentment. You remember the things you had as a kid. You remember the excitement and warmth of that world, how immediate and raw everything felt, and you want to go back. You start to regret that the world has changed, even though what changed the most is you.I like to think that life slows down once you form a stable image and story of yourself. The more you convince yourself that that image is fixed, the faster time will go by. That might justify why childhood seems longer, since that image seems to form around adolescence.Experiencing new \"firsts\" but keeping that image of yourselfe fixed just works for a while. That is why it may lead to resentment, as the article says.So dont fool yourself: some image of who you are gives you some stability, but just use it for that, so that you dont run crazy with options.If you treat every event as something that might reshape your ego, then suddenly a big number of experiences are new, and time suddenly slows dont.

I'm in my mid-fifties now, and a year is still a long time. They years get short if you fall into a routine and never do anything new, but it is easy enough not to fall into that trap. And I say that as someone who thrives in doing the same routine every day. I get my variety in the details, doing different projects, having different conversations, trying new foods, exploring new places.>  Childhood memories have an intensity and a vibrancy that it is difficult for the rest of life to match.I've found that we all have different memories. I know people who cannot remember their childhood at all, and I've known people who remember it well. But not having vibrant memories of your adult life? That feels a little depressing.  Adulthood is when you step up and become your own self, directing your own life. It is when I climbed mountains, explored the world, met new people, tried different careers, moved to new towns, had long-term relationships including children, created art, studied subjects beyond the standard high school education. Childhood was OK, but was fairly anxiety-filled, at least for me. The truly amazing experiences in life were as an adult.The author addresses this, of course. But he does so in a really odd way:> This works, to a point, but there are only so many firsts for you, and chasing this exclusively seems to lead to resentment. You remember the things you had as a kid. You remember the excitement and warmth of that world, how immediate and raw everything felt, and you want to go back.This is where my reaction was: \"Dude, wat??\" If adult experiences make you resentful, something is really off. If a good experience makes you wish you could go back to being a child, I'd be recommending therapy because that is not the reaction most adults have to new experiences. I don't say that to be mean, either - if your childhood memories are that much stronger than adult ones, that is not the typical human experience, and I would sincerely be asking for medical and psych support to figure out if something is wrong.",

Gymnastics seems to peak between age 13-16; it was enough of a problem that the FIG set an age limit of 16 so the sport wasn't dominated by prepubescent girls age 13-14 (18 for men because the events tend to be more strength-based than coordination-based).  Top table tennis players usually tend to start between 4-6 [1] and win their championships around their early 20s. [2]There's some lag between starting and being world-class simply because continued practice makes you better.

In each port is a tower with a robot arm that connects the charging cable automatically every time the ship comes to the dock. The system charges 10.5 kV, 600Amp and 10.5MW. The batteries have a total capacity of 4,160 kWh, which means that we always have a surplus of electricity if for some reason we cannot load during a stop or if the transit takes more time than usual.In Helsingör the ferries charge for approx. 6 minutes and in Helsingborg the ferries charge for approx. 9 minutes.

Cloaking is a black-hat technique where you show one version of a landing page to the ad review bot (e.g., a blog about health) and a different version to the actual user (e.g., a diet pill scam).Meta has spent years building AI to detect when affiliates cloak their links. Now, according to this report, Meta is essentially cloaking the ads themselves from journalists and regulators by likely filtering based on user profiling, IP ranges, or behavioral signals. They are using the sophisticated targeting tools intended for advertisers to target the \"absence\" of scrutiny.[0] https://www.reuters.com/investigations/meta-created-playbook...",

Facebook not only denied them, but when the non-profit asked for a review of the denial they were warned if they asked again their entire facebook page would be flagged and deleted.Facebook is large enough I cannot imagine their reasoning. They very likely have several conflicting streams of logic depending on teams involved.  One thing I think is reasonable is that money is a motivational factor for Facebook.Put simply, organizations who come in immediately spending money on advertising are more likely to be fast tracked.  Organizations who don't spent a lot of money are more likely to be shut down.  (\"you've been a freeloader all this time who will likely not pay sustainably after this one-time payment. We're focusing on sustainable paying customers, goodbye\")Addition:  Now that I think about it, I wouldn't be surprised if there is a literal metric of \"money/time\" ratio.  The more money you spend in less time likely improves your chances of being fast-tracked, thus biasing new accounts who immediately spend on advertising over existing ones who sparsely pay.",

That's when I bought another pre-paid card for a limit of $200 and funded my acct again. I never noticed any uptick in customers contacting me from my websites.Eventually Google shut down the ability to use pre-paid credit cards (it came back an error when I attempted to enter the new card no) and that's when I closed my account. Their response was too obvious evidence <Goggle in conspiracy with the ad click bots> desired the ability to scam my account and one day I would check my email and get a $5,000 bill.There is a rather obvious \"conflict of interest\" when you have to dispute a charge with your credit card provider knowing that the credit card co is fully aware they only make their \"cut\" if the charge goes through.",

      "abstract": "该讨论围绕《航天器设计的阿金定律》这份经典工程准则展开。社区普遍认为这些定律具有持久价值，尤其适用于工程和软件开发领域。有用户指出，其中关于“质量思维比快速思维更重要”的论述在LLM时代尤为贴切；也有用户结合定律20，认为其精准描述了当下初创企业“糟糕的演示会立刻葬送优秀设计”的现状。讨论中提到，这些原则已被改编至其他领域（如维基百科的条目创作）。分歧点主要在于对具体技术细节的考证，例如有用户对文件中提到的调制技术速率提出异议，并展开了关于电话线信道容量的技术讨论。多数参与者认同这些定律深刻揭示了工程实践中的常见陷阱与核心原则。",

          "content": "> \"Trellis coded modulation got this rate up to 50 kilobaud by the 1990s\"Not quite, and an interesting story that fits these engineering maxims better than you might think.An analog channel with the bandwidth and SNR characteristics of a landline phone line has (IIRC) a Shannon capacity of 30-something kbit/s, which was closely approached with V.34, which used trellis coded modulation plus basically every other coding and equalization mechanism they knew of at the time to get to 33.6kb/s on a good day.But... by the 80s or so the phone system was only analog for the \"last mile\" to the home - the rest of the system was digital, sending 8-bit samples (using logarithmic mu-law encoding) at a sampling rate of 8000 samples/s, and if you had a bunch of phone lines coming into a facility you could get those lines delivered over a digital T1 link.Eventually someone realized that if your ISP-side modem directly outputs digital audio, the downstream channel capacity is significantly higher - in theory the limit is probably 64000 bit/s, i.e. the bit rate of the digital link, although V.90 could only achieve about 56000 b/s in theory, and more like 53kb/s in practice. (in particular, the FCC limited the total signal power, which means not all 64000 combinations of bits in a second of audio would be allowable)I worked with modem modulation folks when I was a co-op student in the mid-80s. They had spent their lives thinking about the world in terms of analog channels, and it took some serious out-of-the-box thinking on someone's part to realize that the channel was no longer analog, and that you could take advantage of that.A few years later those same folks all ended up working on cable modems, and it was back to the purely analog world again.",

I took that capstone spacecraft design course at MIT in 2003, and can't recall encountering this list (based on the archive snapshot, he would have shifted on to UMD more than thirty years prior).  The project was satellite-focused rather than launch vehicle, so maybe his instructions were imbued implicitly into the course?• Much of the design-conservative ethos permeates aerospace development. It's unsurprising that astronautics evolution has been slow at least until Elon came along.  I wonder how Elon / SpaceX folks would respond to these laws esp. #39 (avoid designing launch vehicles).• Also the one that was conspicuously maintained at the end across the different archived versions:\"Space is a completely unforgiving environment. If you screw up the engineering, somebody dies (and there's no partial credit because most of the analysis was right...)\"It's notable that the wayback machine's first crawl of Akin's list is late 2003 (so presumably when the source page went live) the year in which the Columbia disaster took place.",

Once a week (Wednesday, I think) somebody would give a presentation over lunch on a paper they'd read. We would get takeout Chinese and eat while discussing the paper.On this particular Wednesday the presentation was on a failed spacecraft program. It's been a long time, but I think it was probably this paper:https://llis.nasa.gov/llis_lib/pdf/1009464main1_0641-mr.pdfwhich is the initial failure analysis of the Mars Climate Orbiter (1999), which famously crashed into Mars during its orbital insertion burn because JPL specifications were in metric, but Lockheed wrote code in imperial units, and as a result there was a failure to properly convert between newtons and pounds. One fact of note was that the the team responsible for spacecraft navigation had already observed anomalous trajectory data but their reports were ignored because they didn't follow program guidelines for filling out the paperwork to document the observations, so the insertion burn went ahead heedless of what the spacecraft's behavior was trying to tell them.Ultimately, the loss of mission was a result of unclear responsibility for ownership of the orbital maneuvering software, including the mission requirements that traced to the software, the development of the software derived from those requirements, tests to validate the software, and reports from users of the software that it was behaving unexpectedly.I was trying to be funny, and turned the statement around from \"clear lines of responsibility\" to \"clear lines of blame\".",

The telco uses digital internally (remember you and your ISP probably aren't at the same exchange), which puts a hard limit on data rate - there is no trick you can do to get more bits through than the bits used in the digital part of the call.If you (as the ISP) buy enough lines you can get them delivered in digital format. A T1 is designed to carry 24 simultaneous phone calls, acting virtually as a bundle of 24 analog phone cables. So the obvious next stage was to have a modem that can handle 24 simultaneous connections on one cable.Now you have ISP\\_modem←Ax24→ISP\\_muxer←Dx24→Telco←→Telco←A→UserThe ISP's modem generates analog signals for up to 24 simultaneous incoming calls, and they pass into a multiplexer that connects 24 analog lines to a T1 line and they go through the telco digitally to users. The maximum bandwidth is still as before - the modem has to generate an analog signal that will still be receivable at the other end after A2D and D2A conversion. Even though the digital bandwidth for the digital part is 56kbps, the maximum achievable bandwidth through this digital-bottlenecked analog call was found to be 33.6kbps.But the industry had an idea: by convincing the telco to install the modems into the user's exchange, the analog portion would only be between the telco and the user, without a digital segment in the middle of it, and therefore wouldn't be bottlenecked the same way. The same digital backhaul from the ISP through the telco was used, but instead of transmitting a digitised analog modem signal and therefore causing degradation of quality, it transmitted your actual internet traffic bits, up to 56kbps. The analog signal was made at the user's side of the telco and didn't have to fit within 56kbps when digitised.Pedantically, the digital circuits are 64kbps but one bit in some bytes is used for call status signaling, which is okay for voice, but the ISP equipment can't predict which bytes have a bit overwritten (and it could be multiple if there are several hops) so it just used 7 bits in each byte.",

Here are a few.- Precocity and curiosity. Access to tech, resources, ways of actually getting answers instead of just hypothesizing. Though a curious mind will always conjure theories of all sorts.- Working on an assortment of devices. Recent, old. Take them apart, ask how do they work. Read up about how they are constructed. Repeat.- Robotics. Dead give away because robotics means embedded and embedded knowledge is gold. As is electronics knowledge among all the knowledge of how sensors actually work and what they do. You don’t wake up knowing how software and hardware interfaces. Along with learning this you learn a ridiculous amount regarding protocols, tools like logic analyzers and oscilloscopes, and patterns that repeat again and again. [0]- Free time. This one is a given. This shit takes too long and all you’ve got are hunches along the way.Take the recent CCC presentation on Miele appliances. The young presenter practically gives the punch line away: he fixes his parents’ house appliances, he rummages forum posts looking for information. He reads data sheets of processors and knows what pin does what. He looks at what others have done and wonders “what if?”. His whole presentation was so textbook and the appliance is an early 2000s model that it’s begging for someone with a shred of curiosity to take it apart and learn how it works. He finished by successfully dumping the firmware even when he thought it couldn’t be done. Along the way his “hunches” show he knows how things work because he’s worked on it before. The only people surprised are people who haven’t done it. He was going to succeed before he began - that’s how prepared you need to be.Now, if you’re not a super talented 12 year old, that’s okay. Start programming microcontrollers and get comfortable with reading voltage levels and signals of GPIOs and peripherals. Learn how your firmware gets loaded at startup. Build some basic protocols and confirm on a logic analyzer. Decode your work with your eyes. Reading binary and hex should be second nature. Read and decode a USB protocol. An SPI protocol. And don’t complain it’s too much work.[0] https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=C1C-DrRZAfw",

Any particular wave though should travel in a straight line (usual caveats apply). Of course you may incidentally also get e.g. sinusoidal variations in intesity perpendicular to the wavevector, but that will be because of the overall beam characteristics.I don't mean to say I know a better way to show this, and I am aware of many complicating factors.

The sinusoid is a good illustration of what a given receiver might detect at some location (X,Y,Z). A more accurate way to show that may be a light source fading on and off to match some frequency (below THz). Then factoring in the speed of light, at time zero, the light will be off, at some arbitrary time 1, the light will be illuminated at 0.25 (scale goes up to 1 here). The light energy peak at time 1 is at the light. Then at time 2, the light goes up to 0.5. That means that the 0.25 light is now 1 unit away from the light while the 0.5 is at the light. Step to time 3 and the light goes up to 0.75, meaning 1 unit from the light, the light is at 0.5 and 2 units from the light, the light is dimmer at 0.25. This repeats with the light hitting 1.0 then falling back to 0.75, then 0.5, etc. The movement of light is key and I think that's what is often either misunderstood or just not considered enough.",

I was in a niche PL subfield (generic programming in the mid-2000s), and there was this one guy I called \"guitar dude\" that kept submitting PL papers using \"guitar theory\". The basis of the theory was an \"algorithm\" he developed to determine if a number was prime in O(1) (constant!!?) time in the size of the number. He was by far the most determined; he had a \"swap\" scam he ran to get his papers in. OTOH, submissions to the editor (my PI) numbered in the THOUSANDS, and we only had, like, 35 attendees at GPCE?

          "content": "I have volunteered in various roles for ACM conferences and thus have some insight into ACM's path towards Open Access over the past years.Just a few things to consider:- ACM is not a for-profit publisher like Springer or Elsevier. Any profits made from their/our publishing activities subsidize e.g., outreach activities, travel stipends for developing countries, and potential losses from e.g. conferences.\n- In my experience, ACM is one of the very few publishers in computer science where you can generally trust the published papers.\n- Keeping a long-term digital library is not just \"putting PDFs on a server\" but involves a lot of additional costs. The ACM HQ is rather lean IMHO, but there are multiple people involved in developing the Digital Library, handling cases of copyright infringement and plagiarism, supporting volunteers, etc. Also, the ACM DL contains a rising number of video recordings of conference talks, etc. Additionally, there are several contractors to be paid. For example, authors no longer generate their own PDFs but submit the LaTeX/Word manuscripts to a central service (TAPS), developed and operated for ACM by an Indian company, Aptara. \n- In the past, subscriptions to the ACM Digital Library were a major, stable source of income for ACM. ACM has to be careful to not get into financial trouble by giving away their crown jewels without generating sufficiently stable alternative income sources.",

Some people seem to like it, but it’s common for people to take it for a while and realize it’s causing side effects like anhedonia, apathy, minor sleep disruptions, or other subtle negative effects. Not everyone, but it’s a common outcome.It also doesn’t quite live up to a lot of the incredible sounding papers for many conditions. It’s really common to find papers or even small trials purporting to find amazing effects from supplements that fail to replicate at scale. NAC does have some legitimate applications and is even used medically for certain conditions. I’m a little more skeptical that all of the amazing positives for every condition under the sun will hold up.",

After each 172-byte row is 10 bytes of ECC data called Parity Inner (PI), which is based on Reed-Solomon and applied to both the header and scrambled user data per row within the sector itself. Then, after the user data and parity inner data, is the 4-byte EDC, which is calculated over the unscrambled user data only. Then, finally, Parity Outer (PO) is another form of ECC that is applied by “column” that spans over an entire block of multiple sectors stacked horizontally, or in other words, a group of 16 sectors.

It's such a powerful glue piece, but also tons of fun to mess around with on its own.The best part? You can create your own components, define your inputs/outputs, and compose them together. The even bestest part? You can dig into the predefined components/effects and see how they work, as they're very often implemented in the same way! The visual editor all drills down to C# in the end, and you can drop into the code or write some HLSL shaders if you want, all with hot reloading.Just give it a try, you won't regret it :)",

          "content": "Wow — TiXL is on HN! I’m one of the maintainers, and I’m blown away by the feedback and traction our software is getting.Some quick answers:Is it an “After Effects” killer? I spent a lot of time with AE and used to teach classes on it. I tried to integrate everything I love into the UX of TiXL and change everything I hated :) So, it depends on what you want to make. TiXL has pretty good keyframing and compositing, and we’re working steadily on improving it. It can probably do a lot, with the benefit that you never have to “render,” and you can combine keyframe animations with procedural animations. But tracking, precise sync with video files, and typography animations are still much better in AE. So, for “traditional” 2D vector motion design, AE is a clear winner. For particle effects, composition, and audio-reactive work, TiXL can be a strong option.As other posters pointed out, it sits somewhere between After Effects, Fusion, TouchDesigner, Blender (with nodes), and Resolume.Windows — yikes: I’m totally with you. Windows is going downhill, not just since Microsoft’s obsession with AI and forcing everybody into their cloud. We’re working on making in running natively on Linux and MacOS. With .NET and ImGui, chances are pretty good. But as another poster pointed out, moving from DX11 to Vulkan will be a tremendous effort. It might be doable, though, because the largest API-specific implementations are bundled into a few low-level components.Anyways! Thanks for featuring our project. If you’re curious, give it a try and join us on Discord. We’re a friendly community doing this thing together — not for profit, but because we really like motion graphics and good interaction design.",

It sounds like this is more trying to compete with offerings like Touch Designer or Resolume than AE, which feels like a space with much more opportunity for disruption (without having a huge full-time team working for years in obscurity).[0] I want someone to do to After Effects what Blender is doing to Cinema4D and Maya (provide a competitive free alternative to people who don’t need corporate deals and support plans). Every piece of software that people usually mention falls short in huge ways. I think a lot of people get into this space not realizing how difficult it is just to have a real-time scrubbable timeline that intelligently caches intermediate steps to disk and can render at lower resolutions to save time. So many alternatives absolutely chug once you have 10 1080p tracks with mattes and different effects. And then you’ve got color space transforms and all the different HDR things and a million other features that users of After Effects often forget are features.",

This YAML file declares all dependencies for the Gem, so RubyGems can know, without evaling anything, what dependencies it needs to install before it can install any particular Gem. Additionally, RubyGems.org provides an API for asking about dependency information, which is actually the normal way of getting dependency info (again, no eval required).\n\nIt would be interesting to compare and contrast the parsing speed for a large representative set of Python dependencies compared to a large representative set of Ruby dependencies. YAML is famously not the most efficient format to parse. We might have been better than `pip`, but I would be surprised if there isn't any room left on the table to parse dependency information in a more efficient format (JSON, protobufs, whatever).That said, the points at the end about not needing to parse gemspecs to install \"most\" dependencies would make this pretty moot (if the information is already returned from the gemserver)",

However, I've not encountered issues while juggling dozens of Ruby projects since around 2011, despite seeing many people's complaints over the years. Ten years ago I was using rvm, and I saw people sharing their issues with it, and listing reasons why rbenv and chruby are better. So I tried those, and my resulting workflow felt basically the same once I got used to the differences.At this point I've used rbenv, rvm, asdf, mise, and one other whose name isn't coming to mind. Not to mention docker containers, with or without any of those tools.I don't mean to project any particular complaint onto you, and I'm curious what part of it is infuriating? Each of the version managers I've used has functioned as advertised, and I'm able to get back to work pretty smoothly.",

You're still paying for the bytecode compilation (and it's serialized, so you're actually spending more time), but you don't associate the time with your package manager.In most cases this will have no noticeable impact (so a sane default) - but when it does count you simply turn on --compile-bytecode.",
