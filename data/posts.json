The highways were fast but you had to pay.Overall, I think fare at point of use is a great structure. In the past we couldn’t enforce it but now we can do this for more things.The only problem is that we’ve decided that impounding cars that don’t have license plates or which have license plate covers is unacceptable because the poor do this most frequently.

People allege that the state government is deliberately designing bottlenecks into the road network to funnel traffic into toll roads (e.g. westbound traffic on Parramatta Road) and it's difficult to disagree with this assessment.

It's also a \"corrective biography\", it dispels a lot of myths.  This book is one of the best examples of accessible writing with flair.  What a writer!Throughout the book, Walker tastefully quotes musical phrases (in notation) from Chopin's works to situate them in context.

          "content": "Technical followed by non-technical. I read more than these, but these are the highlights.Mouse, a Language for Microcomputers by Peter Grogono - Mouse is basically an esolang with barely any abstraction facilities, but the book was well-written and the language compelling enough to explore further.Notes on Distance Dialing (pdf) by AT&T - Described the telephone systems of the USA and Canada in the mid-1950s. The reading is a dry as it gets, but it was a fascinating dive into a vastly complex system solving extremely hard problems. This is a must-read for folks interested in systems-thinking. That said, I am actively looking for recommendations for books about the process of designing and building the unbelievably complex telephony system over the rudiments of the earlier systems. Recommendations welcomed!The Eye of Osiris by R. Austin Freeman - This is the first book that I’ve read from Freeman and I suspect that I will read many more in the future. The story follows the disappearance of John Bellingham, Egyptologist and the subsequent investigation. As the investigation stalls, the eminent Dr. Thorndyke digs into the case. The story sets up the mystery nicely and indeed provides enough information to the reader to infer how the disappearance occurred and who or what facilitated it. The book is one of the best whodunits that I’ve ever read.The Mystery of Edwin Drood by Charles Dickens - His final work remains unfinished as he passed away before he could complete it. Further complicating the meta-story is that he also didn’t outline the ending nor even put to paper the “villain” of the story. The meta-mystery of the ending has motivated a mountain of speculation around the ending including dozens of continuations of the story from other authors, all deriving their pet endings from textual hints, accounts from Dickens’ friends, illustration notes, and even in some cases seances supposedly accompanied by the spirit of Dickens himself. What was written by Dickens is spectacular and a compelling mystery and although it would be great to know the resolution, in some ways the “Droodiana” that has cropped up over the past 150+ years is reason enough for it to remain a mystery. The whole lore around Edwin Drood is a worthwhile hobby in itself and well-worth exploring. The Chiltern Library edition of the book contains the story and a good bit of the lore around the writing and the meta-works available at the time of its publication.The Shadow People by Margaret St. Clair - Sadly out of print and difficult to find, but I’ve had it on my shelves for decades and finally got around to reading it. The book came onto my radar in the 1980s when I learned about it in the appendix-n of the 1st edition Advanced D&D Dungeon Masters Guide. I enjoyed many of the books at the time and have slowly swung around to re-reading them over the past few years. Sadly, most on the list do not stand the test of time for me, but St. Clair’s mixture of 60s counter-cultural leanings in a fantasy/sf world still works. The cultural touch-points in the book feel quite dated, but despite the occasional awkwardness, the story is unique even today.Lolly Willowes by Sylvia Townsend Warner - The book started as a passable novel of manners focused on a turn of the century British middle-class family. The titular character was mostly background decoration for the first third of the novel and AFAIR was talked about only in the third-person. It’s only when she made the choice to move out on her own to the country in her middle age does she gain a central role in the narrative and her inner thoughts revealed. This is where things really pick up because I was shocked to learn that this unassuming woman’s inner thoughts had a delicious darkness to them. I don’t want to give away too much, but I’ll just say that you will not expect how the story ends.Patience by Daniel Clowes - A profound graphic novel using time-travel to explore the idea of enduring love with a story that proceed through time, following Jack as he tries to alter the past and save the woman he loves. This well-known science fiction motif is elevated by Clowes’ signature psychological complexity.Narcissus and Goldmund by Herman Hesse - I’ve read most of the books by Hermann Hesse but this one escaped my attention until this year. The story follows the parallel lives of a monk Narcissus and his passionate friend Goldmund as they respectively search for meaning in life through spiritual means and through pleasures of the flesh.We Who Are About To… by Joanna Russ - A small group of astronauts crash land on a hostile alien world and quickly realize that rescue is unlikely to come. Many SF stories have started this way and so the expectation is that this is a colonization story… but Russ thrives on subverting reader expectations.Fifty Forgotten Records by R.B. Russell - Another lovely entry in Russell’s series (one can hope) of autobiographical explorations of art, so far covering literature and now music. This book describes 50 records of varying popularity and Russell’s personal connections to each. While I certainly enjoyed finding a dozen or so new albums to explore, the true triumph of the book lies in the vulnerable, reflective memoir threaded throughout.The Way of All Flesh by Samuel Butler A novel that follows 4-generations of the Ponitifex family, with a particular bildungsroman-esque thread around Ernest, a young man who’s naivete leads to his downfall and how his life unfolds thereafter.I wrote about these (and more) at https://blog.fogus.me/2025/12/23/the-best-things-and-stuff-o...",

The story follows the parallel lives of a monk Narcissus and his passionate friend Goldmund as they respectively search for meaning in life through spiritual means and through pleasures of the flesh.We Who Are About To… by Joanna Russ - A small group of astronauts crash land on a hostile alien world and quickly realize that rescue is unlikely to come. Many SF stories have started this way and so the expectation is that this is a colonization story… but Russ thrives on subverting reader expectations.Fifty Forgotten Records by R.B. Russell - Another lovely entry in Russell’s series (one can hope) of autobiographical explorations of art, so far covering literature and now music. This book describes 50 records of varying popularity and Russell’s personal connections to each. While I cert人工智能nly enjoyed finding a dozen or so new albums to explore, the true triumph of the book lies in the vulnerable, reflective memoir threaded throughout.The Way of All Flesh by Samuel Butler A novel that follows 4-generations of the Ponitifex family, with a particular bildungsroman-esque thread around Ernest, a young man who’s n人工智能vete leads to his downfall and how his life unfolds thereafter.I wrote about these (and more) at https://blog.fogus.me/2025/12/23/the-best-things-and-stuff-o..."

We went full ‘possum’ with our baby and I like how happy he became.I've also read Ten Things I Wish You Knew About Your Child's Mental Health. To me this could be an instant classic. No fluff, lots of advice for parents. Prima.There's plenty of literature on parenting, but so much of it is poorly written or poorly researched. Be careful out there. (And don't read PLS, yikes.)---I finally discovered Andy Weir, the Thursday Next series, and The 13.5 Lives of Captain Bluebear. I'm amazed it took me so long to get there. All excellent.For some reason I decided to read all 7 Harry Potters in French. If you're learning French, it's a great idea, the French gets progressively harder so you can keep up!Bryson's At Home: A Short History of Private Life has been my companion for some weeks, but it's quite long.I'm happy with all my reading this year, some 32 books, many in a foreign language.

(I probably should have read it slower; by the last two books, I was just flowing with the text, not paying as much attention to the overarching plot.)Heinlein's \"Orphans of the Sky\" was pretty bad. So much early scifi is considered great because it's groundbreaking, writing about things nobody else has before. The concept of a generation ship was pretty new at the time Heinlein was writing it, and it has some very interesting concepts, but the book has some really bad problems. If you've read it, you know; if you haven't, and decide to, you'll see it for yourself.I binged a few Brandon Sanderson books. The standalones are great; the Stormlight Archive is a huge slog through some beautiful writing, but I'm not sure I'm willing to spend so much time in beautiful books that move the plot forward so slowly.Exordia, by Seth Dickinson, started off incredible, kept going, but the ending felt like both a fizzle as well as a cliff-hanger for the next book. I'm glad I read it, but I wish it had a clear conclusion it wanted to reach.Adrian Tchaikovsky's \"Children of Memory\" delivers more of the great philosophical questions & answers about the nature of consciousness and personhood that the previous books did, A+. No idea where he could possibly go from there, but if he does, I'm going along for the journey. (Honorable mention: Alien Clay. Dishonorable mention: Service Model.)Eric Flint's \"Fenrir\" was a fun BDO near-future space adventure. (As was John Sanford's Saturn Run, but that wasn't a 2025 book I read.)",

To me it seemed like it made no sense,  like if you really want to be invisible just don't post it because you can't really take things back.At some point I realized those people were just like that.I worked at a startup circa 2012 or so which was unusually unclear in its mission but the paychecks and the parties were good and the idea seemed to be helping people partition out different parts of the identities in terms of interests so you could get Paul-the-mild-mannered-applications-developer,  Paul-as-a-marketer/huckster,  and Paul-as-a-fox,  and Paul-with-an-embarassing-interest, etc.We had the hardest time expl人工智能ning to the press (TechCrunch would say they didn't get it!) and everyone else,  I could probably pitch it as well as anybody and I didn't do very well."

It's like something in between XMLDSIG (which pulls cryptographic control data out of random places in XML messages according to attacker-controlled tags) and SSL2 (with no coherent authentication of the complete handshake).The attack on detached signatures (attack #1) happens because GnuPG needs to run a complicated state machine that can put processing into multiple different modes, among them three different styles of message signature. In GPG, that whole state machine apparently collapses down to a binary check of \"did we see any data so that we'd need to verify a signature?\", and you can selectively flip that predicate back and forth by shoving different packets into message stream, even if you've already sent data that needs to be verified.The malleability bug (attack #4) is particularly slick. Again, it's an incoherent state machine issue. GPG can \"fail\" to process a packet because it's cryptographically invalid. But it can also fail because the message framing itself is corrupted. Those latter non-cryptographic failures are handled by aborting the processing of the message, putting GPG into an unexpected state where it's handling an error and \"forgetting\" to check the message authenticator. You can CBC-bitflip known headers to force GPG into processing DEFLATE compression, and mangle the message such that handling the message prints the plaintext in its output.The formfeed bug (#3) is downright weird. GnuPG has special handling for `\\f`; if it occurs at the end of a line, you can inject arbitrary unsigned data, because of GnuPG's handling of line truncation. Why is this even a feature?Some of these attacks look situational, but that's deceptive, because PGP is (especially in older jankier systems) used as an encryption backend for applications --- Mallory getting Alice to sign or encrypt something on her behalf is an extremely realistic threat model (it's the same threat model as most cryptographic attacks on secure cookies: the app automatically signs stuff for users).There is no reason for a message encryption system to have this kind of complexity. It's a deep architectural flaw in PGP. You want extremely simple, orthogonal features in the format, ideally treating everything as clearly length-delimited opaque binary blobs. Instead you get a Weird Machine, and talks like this one.Amazing work.",

When they see GPL etc. then they will be able to use it in some cases and not others depending on what they are working on.

Then you can start applying normal fruit rules. Some want to be eaten, or picked up and moved around. Some want to keep insects from infesting the fruit. Others don't give a damn and release spores into the wind or water.Also remember that nicotine is an insecticide. Insects that nibble on tobacco die, which prevents infestation at scale. (Un?)fortunately it's also neuroactive in apes, so we farm incredible quantities of tobacco to extract its poisons.There is no logic in evolution at large scales.

Then you can start applying normal fruit rules. Some want to be eaten, or picked up and moved around. Some want to keep insects from infesting the fruit. Others don't give a damn and release spores into the wind or water.Also remember that nicotine is an insecticide. Insects that nibble on tobacco die, which prevents infestation at scale. (Un?)fortunately it's also neuroactive in apes, so we farm incredible quantities of tobacco to extract its poisons.There is no logic in evolution at large scales.

Cultivation would involve planting or having access to the correct host species (Yunnan pine) which is a prohibitive barrier for most.It's also not yet known if the active compound can survive dehydration like psilocybin. If not, it would mean even experiencing l. asiatica will be very difficult to impossible for enthusiasts not residing in its native region."

And in this case, rely on subordinates for glad-handing and vision pitches, while itself focusing on coordinating them, staging them to the right meetings, coordinating between departments, etc.I think an 人工智能 could be strong at a few skills, if appropriately chosen:- being gaslightingly polite while firmly telling others no;- doing a good job of compressing company wide news into short, layperson summaries for investors and the public;- making PR statements, shareholder calls, etc; and,- dealing with the deluge of meetings and em人工智能ls to keep its subordinates rowing in the same direction.Would it require that we have staff support some of the traditional soft skills? Absolutely. But there’s nothing fundamentally stopping an 人工智能 首席执行官 from running the company."

It's really not that hard, and the (F.) manual explains the basic concepts fairly well.Now, granted, ffmpeg's defaults (reencoding by default and only keeping one stream of each type unless otherwise specified) aren't great, which can create some footguns, but as long as you remember to pass `-c copy` by default you should be fine.Also, hiding those footguns is likely to create more harm than it fixes. Case in point: \"ff convert video.mkv to mp4\" (an extremely common usecase) maps to `ffmpeg -i video.mkv -y video.mp4` here, which does a full reencode (losing quality and wasting time) for what can usually just be a simple remux.Similarly, \"ffmpeg extract audio from video.mp4\" will unconditionally reencode the audio to mp3, again losing quality. The quality settings are also hardcoded and hidden from the user.I can sympathize with ffmpeg syntax looking complicated at first glance, but the main reason for this is just that multimedia is really complicated and that some of this complexity is necessary in order to not make stupid mistakes that lose quality or waste CPU resources. I truly believe that these ffmpeg wrappers that try to make it seem overly simple (at least when it's this simple, i.e. not even exposing quality settings or differentiating between reencoding and remuxing) are more hurtful than helpful. Not only can they give worse results, but by hiding this complexity from users they also give users the wrong ideas about how multimedia works. \"Abstractions\" like this are exactly how beliefs like \"resolution and quality are the same thing\" come to be. I believe the way to go should be educating users about video formats and proper ffmpeg usage (e.g. with good cheat sheets), not by hiding complexity that really should not be hidden.Edit: Reading through my comment again, I have to apologize for the slightly facetious opening statement, even if I quality it later on. The fact that so many ffmpeg wrappers exists is saying something about its apparent difficulty, but as I argue above, a) there are reasons for this (namely, multimedia itself just being complicated), and b) I believe there are good and bad ways to \"fix\" this, with oversimplified wrappers being more on the \"bad\" side.",

Mix and match based on what catches different issues.2- Mysti is now MIT Licensed.

KiloCode also added autocomplete, but it doesn't seem to work with BYOK."

Applying the same transfer function to all pixels corresponds pretty tightly to film & paper exposure in analog photography. So one reasonable followup question is: did we count manually over- or under-exposing an analog photo to be manipulation or “processing”? Like you can’t see an image without exposing it, so even though there are timing & brightness recommendations for any given film or paper, generally speaking it’s not considered manipulation to expose it until it’s visible. Sometimes if we pushed or pulled to change the way something looks such that you see things that weren’t visible to the naked eye, then we call it manipulation, but generally people aren’t accused of “photoshopping” something just by raising or lowering the brightness a little, right?When I started reading the article, my first thought was, ‘there’s no such thing as an unprocessed photo that you can see’. Sensor readings can’t be looked at without making choices about how to expose them, without choosing a mapping or transfer function. That’s not to mention that they come with physical response curves that the author went out of his way to sort-of remove. The first few dark images in there are a sort of unnatural way to view images, but in fact they are just as processed as the final image, they’re simply processed differently. You can’t avoid “processing” a digital image if you want to see it, right? Measuring light with sensors involves response curves, transcoding to an image format involves response curves, and displaying on monitor or paper involves response curves, so any image has been processed a bunch by the time we see it, right? Does that count as “processing”?

If clocks are out of sync, the database might order them incorrectly, violating consistency guarantees.This is only true if you use wall clock time as part of your database’s consistency algorithm. Generally I think this is a huge mistake. It’s almost always much easier to swap to a logical clock - which doesn’t care about wall time. And then you don’t have to worry about ntp.The basic idea is this: event A happened before event B iff A (or something that happened after A) was observed by the node that generated B before B was generated. As a result, you end up with a dag of events - kind of like git. Some events aren’t ordered relative to one another. (We say, they happened concurrently). If you ever need a global order for all events, you can deterministically pick an arbitrary order for concurrent events by comparing ids or something. And this will give you a total order that will be the same on all peers.If you make database events work like this, time is a little more complex. (It’s a graph traversal rather than simple numbers). But as a result the system clock doesn’t matter. No need to worry about atomic clocks, skew, drift, monotonicity, and all of that junk. It massively simplifies your system design.",

For example, on-prem trading systems almost always use PTP or PPS for sub-microsecond timestamping, often on dedicated networks to reduce jitter (for meeting regulatory requirements like MiFID II and CAT) while the rest of their infra (in on-prem and cloud) just runs NTP for millisecond-class sync. Both protocols are fundamentally sensitive to network conditions — the mean offset may look fine, but outliers due to congestion/jitter can be very poor.The consequence of having multiple time domains is pretty painful when you need to reconcile logs or transaction histories across systems with different sync accuracy. Millisecond NTP logs and sub-microsecond PTP logs don’t line up cleanly, so correlating events end-to-end can become guesswork rather than deterministic ordering.If you want reliable cross-system telemetry and audit trails, you'll need a single, high-accuracy time sync approach across your whole stack.",

My opinion is different, but that's totally fine - we have different views here.What I completely disagree with, though, is this statement:> Without any types in a dynamic language, you often end up with code that can be quite difficult to understand what kinds of objects are represented by a given variable.I have been writing ruby code since about 22 years (almost) now. I never needed types as such. My code does not depend on types or assumptions about variables per se, although I do, of course, use .is_a? and .respond_to? quite a lot, to determine some sanitizing or logic steps (e. g. if an Array is given to a method, I may iterate over that array as such, and pass it recursively into the method back).Your argument seems to be more related to naming variables. People could name a variable in a certain way if they need this, e. g. array_all_people = [].

My opinion is different, but that's totally fine - we have different views here.What I completely disagree with, though, is this statement:> Without any types in a dynamic language, you often end up with code that can be quite difficult to understand what kinds of objects are represented by a given variable.I have been writing ruby code since about 22 years (almost) now. I never needed types as such. My code does not depend on types or assumptions about variables per se, although I do, of course, use .is_a? and .respond_to? quite a lot, to determine some sanitizing or logic steps (e. g. if an Array is given to a method, I may iterate over that array as such, and pass it recursively into the method back).Your argument seems to be more related to naming variables. People could name a variable in a cert人工智能n way if they need this, e. g. array_all_people = [].

Music was a massive issue. It's just that it became an industry issue a little later as production moved to Taiwan and we were increasing our AD curve.The issue of music crashing a hard disk drive was a genuine \nproblem. Since I later specialized in hard drives, I can confirm that every \nmanufacturer faced this issue as multimedia laptops became more common and \nwe transitioned to higher areal densities. To state the obvious, we shrank \nthe tracks every time to achieve larger capacities. We were doubling \ncapacities every nine to twelve months when we first introduced MR, GMR, \nand PMR heads. The hard drive industry employs incredible control theory \nexperts due to the requirement of keeping a head on track. Personal opinion, which I probably should research, but I believe that one of the densest concentrations of Ph.D.s in leading edge control theory could be found within the hard disk drive industry.  Amazing things happen when you're trying to fly nanometers off the disc in a track that is maybe 100 nanometers wide at the time.By 2010ish, as part of our development suite, we actually played music \nthrough the speakers to identify these types of issues.

I'm not saying that that couldn't happen, but generally what we did is we had the throughput test that we were run on the hard drives. Then we would go blast the music full bore and there were certain bandwidth requirements that we needed to get out of the hard disk drive.

It kept becoming a slideshow (unless I put an ice pack under it!) and I realized it’s because the battery life is so good it’s the only time of the week I charge the thing, so charging the battery was making the poor laptop a hot mess that was thermal throttling like crazy. This is with a nice dock that can push around 100W, so it isn’t necessarily an underprovisioned charger.I started charging it an hour or two before our session, and the issues stopped."

Integrity is the ability of code to locally declare its reliance on some invariant - e.g. that a certain class must not be extended, that a method can only be called by other methods in the same class, or that a field cannot be reassigned after being assigned in the constructor - and have the platform guarantee that the invariant is preserved globally throughout the lifetime of the program, no matter what other code does. What we call \"memory safety\" is an example of some invariants that have integrity.This is obviously important for security as it significantly reduces the blast radius of a vulnerability (some attacks that can be done in JS or Python cannot be done in Java), but it's also important for performance, as the compiler needs to know that certain optimisations preserve meaning. E.g. strings cannot be constant-folded if they can't be relied upon to be truly immutable.

That's why the default behavior of almost any \"automock\" is to implement an interface by doing nothing and returning nothing (or perhaps default-initialized values) and provide tools for just tacking assertions onto it. If it was a proper implementation that just happened to be in-memory, it wouldn't really be a \"mock\", in my opinion.For example, let's say you want to test that some handler is properly adding data to a cache. IMO the traditional mock approach that is supported by mocking libraries is to go take your RedisCache implementation and create a dummy that does nothing, then add assertions that say, the `set` method gets called with some set of arguments. You can add return values to the mock too, but I think this is mainly meant to be in service of just making the code run and not actually implementing anything.Meanwhile, you could always make a minimal \"test\" implementation (I think these are sometimes called \"fakes\", traditionally, though I think this nomenclature is even more confusing) of your Cache interface that actually does behave like an in-memory cache, then your test could assert as to its contents. Doing this doesn't require a \"mocking\" library, and in this case, what you're making is not really a \"mock\" - it is, in fact, a full implementation of the interface, that you could use outside of tests (e.g. in a development server.) I think this can be a pretty good medium in some scenarios, especially since it plays along well with in-process tools like fake clocks/timers in languages like Go and JavaScript.Despite the pitfalls, I mostly prefer to just use the actual implementations where possible, and for this I like testcontainers. Most webserver projects I write/work on naturally require a container runtime for development for other reasons, and testcontainers is glue that can use that existing container runtime setup (be it Docker or Podman) to pretty rapidly bootstrap test or dev service dependencies on-demand. With a little bit of manual effort, you can make it so that your normal test runner (e.g. `go test ./...`) can run tests normally, and automatically skip anything that requires a real service dependency in the event that there is no Docker socket available.

          "content": "I have a hot take. Modern computer graphics is very complicated, and it's best to build up fundamentals rather than diving off the deep end into Vulkan, which is really geared at engine professionals who want to shave every last microsecond off their frame-times. Vulkan and D3D12 are great, they provide very fine-grained host-device synchronisation mechanisms that can be used to their maximum by seasoned engine programmers. At the same time a newbie can easily get bogged down by the sheer verbosity, and don't even get me started on how annoying the initial setup boilerplate is, which can be extremely daunting for someone just starting out.GPUs expose a completely different programming memory model, and the issue I would say is conflating computer graphics with GPU programming. The two are obviously related, don't get me wrong, but they can and do diverge quite significantly at times. This is more true recently with the push towards GPGPU, where GPUs now combine several different coprocessors beyond just the shader cores, and can be programmed with something like a dozen different APIs.I would instead suggest:  1) Implement a CPU rasteriser, with just two stages: a primitive assembler, and a rasteriser.\n  2) Implement a CPU ray tracer. \n\nWeb links for tutorials respectively:  https://haqr.eu/tinyrenderer/\n  https://raytracing.github.io/books/RayTracingInOneWeekend.html\n\nThese can be extended in many, many ways that will keep you sufficiently occupied trying to maximise performance and features. In fact to even achieve some basic correctness will require quite a degree of complexity: the primitive assembler will of course need frustum- and back-face culling (and these will mean re-triangulating some primitives). The rasteriser will need z-buffering. The ray-tracer will need lighting, shadow, and camera intersection algorithms for different primitives, accounting for floating-point divergence; spheres, planes, and triangles can all be individually optimised.Try adding various anti-aliasing algorithms to the rasteriser. Add shading; begin with flat, then extend to per-vertex to per-fragment. Try adding a tessellator where the level of detail is controlled by camera distance. Add in early discard instead of the usual z-buffering.To the basic Whitted CPU ray tracer, add BRDFs; add microfacet theory, add subsurface scattering, caustics, photon mapping/light transport, and work towards a general global illumination implementation. Add denoising algorithms. And of course, implement and use acceleration data structures for faster intersection lookups; there are many.Working on all of these will frankly give you a more detailed and intimate understanding of how GPUs work and why they have been developed a certain way, rather than programming with something like Vulkan, spending time filling in struct after struct.After this, feel free to explore any one of the two more 'basic' graphics APIs: OpenGL 4.6, or D3D11. shadertoy.com and shaderacademy.com are great resources to understand fragment shaders. There are again several widespread shader languages, though most of industry uses HLSL. GLSL can be simpler, but HLSL is definitely more flexible.At this point, explore more complicated scenarios: deferred rendering, pre- and post-processing for things like ambient occlusion, mirrors, temporal anti-aliasing, render-to-texture for lighting and shadows, etc. This is video-game focused; you could go another direction by exploring 2D UIs, text rendering, compositing, and more.As for why I recommend starting with CPUs, only to end up back with GPUs again, and one may ask: 'hey, who uses CPUs any more for graphics?' Let me answer: WARP[1] and LLVMpipe[2] are both production-quality software rasterisers; frequently loaded during remote desktop sessions. In fact 'rasteriser' is an understatement: they expose full-fledged software implementations of D3D10/11 and OpenGL/Vulkan devices respectively.

          "content_cn": "I have a hot take. Modern computer graphics is very complicated, and it's best to build up fundamentals rather than diving off the deep end into Vulkan, which is really geared at engine professionals who want to shave every last microsecond off their frame-times. Vulkan and D3D12 are great, they provide very fine-gr人工智能ned host-device synchronisation mechanisms that can be used to their maximum by seasoned engine programmers. At the same time a newbie can easily get bogged down by the sheer verbosity, and don't even get me started on how annoying the initial setup boilerplate is, which can be extremely daunting for someone just starting out.GPUs expose a completely different programming memory model, and the issue I would say is conflating computer graphics with GPU programming. The two are obviously related, don't get me wrong, but they can and do diverge quite significantly at times. This is more true recently with the push towards GPGPU, where GPUs now combine several different coprocessors beyond just the shader cores, and can be programmed with something like a dozen different 应用程序接口s.I would instead suggest:  1) Implement a CPU rasteriser, with just two stages: a primitive assembler, and a rasteriser.\n  2) Implement a CPU ray tracer. \n\nWeb links for tutorials respectively:  https://haqr.eu/tinyrenderer/\n  https://raytracing.GitHub.io/books/RayTracingInOneWeekend.html\n\nThese can be extended in many, many ways that will keep you sufficiently occupied trying to maximise performance and features. In fact to even achieve some basic correctness will require quite a degree of complexity: the primitive assembler will of course need frustum- and back-face culling (and these will mean re-triangulating some primitives). The rasteriser will need z-buffering. The ray-tracer will need lighting, shadow, and camera intersection algorithms for different primitives, accounting for floating-point divergence; spheres, planes, and triangles can all be individually optimised.Try adding various anti-aliasing algorithms to the rasteriser. Add shading; begin with flat, then extend to per-vertex to per-fragment. Try adding a tessellator where the level of det人工智能l is controlled by camera distance. Add in early discard instead of the usual z-buffering.To the basic Whitted CPU ray tracer, add BRDFs; add microfacet theory, add subsurface scattering, caustics, photon mapping/light transport, and work towards a general global illumination implementation. Add denoising algorithms. And of course, implement and use acceleration data structures for faster intersection lookups; there are many.Working on all of these will frankly give you a more det人工智能led and intimate understanding of how GPUs work and why they have been developed a cert人工智能n way, rather than programming with something like Vulkan, spending time filling in struct after struct.After this, feel free to explore any one of the two more 'basic' graphics 应用程序接口s: OpenGL 4.6, or D3D11. shadertoy.com and shaderacademy.com are great resources to understand fragment shaders. There are ag人工智能n several widespread shader languages, though most of industry uses HLSL. GLSL can be simpler, but HLSL is definitely more flexible.At this point, explore more complicated scenarios: deferred rendering, pre- and post-processing for things like ambient occlusion, mirrors, temporal anti-aliasing, render-to-texture for lighting and shadows, etc. This is video-game focused; you could go another direction by exploring 2D UIs, text rendering, compositing, and more.As for why I recommend starting with CPUs, only to end up back with GPUs ag人工智能n, and one may ask: 'hey, who uses CPUs any more for graphics?' Let me answer: WARP[1] and LLVMpipe[2] are both production-quality software rasterisers; frequently loaded during remote desktop sessions. In fact 'rasteriser' is an understatement: they expose full-fledged software implementations of D3D10/11 and OpenGL/Vulkan devices respectively. And naturally, most film renderers still run on the CPU, due to their improved floating-point precision; films can't really get away with the ephemeral smudging of video games. Also, CPU cores are quite cheap nowadays, so it's not unusual to see a render farm of a million+ cores chewing away at a complex Pixar or Dreamworks frame.[1]: https://learn.microsoft.com/en-gb/windows/win32/direct3darti...[2]: https://docs.mesa3d.org/drivers/llvmpipe.html"

Although some might chafe ag人工智能nst procedures and checklists, they exist for a reason: providing a kind of institutional memory that helps employees avoid common screwups at work.That's why we want machines in our systems - to eliminate human errors. That's why we implement strict verifiable processes - to minimize the risk of human errors when we need humans in the loop.Having a machine making human errors is the exact opposite of what we want. How would we even fix this if the machines are tr人工智能ned on human input?"

I've never been able to find information bout the mechanism or how it's triggered."
