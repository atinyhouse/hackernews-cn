      "abstract": "该讨论围绕特朗普宣称马杜罗被捕的新闻展开，核心话题是美国对委内瑞拉的军事干预及其国际影响。多数用户批评美国长期干涉拉美事务的传统，认为此举破坏主权并可能导致地区动荡。有人认为行动背后是特朗普及其石油金主的利益驱动，旨在控制委内瑞拉石油资源；也有用户指出军事干预可能给当地民众带来人道灾难，甚至引发类似海地的长期混乱。讨论中提到，此事可能被中国视为干预台湾的先例，加剧地缘政治紧张。部分用户强调，无论对马杜罗的评价如何，超级大国秘密抓捕他国元首违背国际原则。共识在于对美国单边行动的普遍质疑，分歧则体现在对动机的分析（经济利益 vs. 对华战略）及后果的预测（内部崩溃 vs. 全球连锁反应）。",

          "content": "\"Overthrowing a dictator sounds morally right. No one mourns a tyrant. But international law wasn't built to protect the good, but to restrain the powerful. That's why it prohibits force almost without exception: not because it ignores injustice, but because it knows that if each country decides whom to 'liberate' by force, the world reverts to the law of the strongest.The problem is not Maduro. The problem is the precedent. When military force is used to change governments without clear rules, sovereignty ceases to be a limit and becomes an obstacle. Today it is 'overthrowing a dictator'; tomorrow it will be 'correcting an election', 'protecting interests', 'restoring order'. The law does not absolve dictatorships, but neither does it legitimize unilateral crusades.The uncomfortable question is not whether a tyrant deserves to fall, but who decides when and how. Because history teaches something brutal: removing a dictator is easy; building justice afterward is not. And when legality is broken in the name of good, what almost always follows is not freedom, but chaos, violence, and new victims. The law exists to remind us of this, even when it makes us uncomfortable.\"-Jose Mariohttps://bsky.app/profile/cristianfarias.com/post/3mbjlwkmb6c...",

Besides Gitmo, the US always leaves when requested in the cases I have been able to find.(Why do we still have a base in Gitmo?  Because Florida is a swing state.  It sucks.)To be fair, the rest of the list looks like an excellent argument for closing all the bases.",

But we can't always rely on mods, you have lives and have to rely on certain pragmatism, you have to wait and see how the community reacts/events unfold to see if something should get a thread on the front page or risk the consequences. And I think you did weigh in but vouching on a single thread may have won out against the flagging, as it should. So I gave the thread a chance and started reading.One of the only changes I think HN could use, is mods being able to make a post in a thread that can not be voted on or replied to but will remain top post and simply stating that the community has ruled and this submission will live but every related submission will be killed as a dupe until the thread dies. But that would be very difficult to do without being accused of having an agenda by one side or the other.Part of the reason I avoid becoming too much a part of sites like HN is because I fear being asked to be more than a user.

The authors find that most of the impact of these sanctions has not been on the government but on the civilian population. The sanctions reduced the public’s caloric intake, increased disease and mortality (for both adults and infants), and displaced millions of Venezuelans who fled the country as a result of the worsening economic depression and hyperinflation. They made it nearly impossible to stabilize Venezuela’s economic crisis. These impacts disproportionately harmed the poorest and most vulnerable Venezuelans.",

And yet, it is transparently clear that the Trump admin is here not to save Venezuela, or Venezuelans… it’s here to line its pockets and that of its shareholders.There was a very evident omission during Trump’s press conference: Any mention of Edmundo Gonzalez Urrutia, the duly elected president-elect of Venezuela (who won with a super majority last July - backed by Maria Corina Machado). Instead, Trump bad mouthed Maria Corina saying that “she does not have the support or respect of the country to run it”. They ousted Maduro, but they kept his VP (Delcy Rodriguez - which along other things is in charge of running the torture centers for political prisoners) as “she will do anything we ask her”. Trump doesn’t care about democracy or regime change - these things take time and are a long, thorny road (this wouldn’t be the US’ first rodeo).

The U.S. (and others) have played this game of “military actions” for so long that we, the regular people, have taken up that language uncritically as well. Once force enters, it is an act of war.

International law means UN, ICC, Geneva conventions, votes and parlimentary procedure.  It means accountability and uniform application of said law. \"Rules-based order\" just gives a slightest hint of legitimacy while Washington and its cronies do whatever they want. \"Rules-based order\" means that the United States can invoke the Monroe Doctrine in Venezuela, Cuba  and all over its \"backyard\" i.e. South America, but Russia doing the same in Ukraine or China doing it in Taiwan is an affront to civillization.What changed more recently is the mask has slipped off.

It stuns me as much as when Encyclopædia Britannica stopped selling print versions a mere 9 years after the publication of Wikipedia, but at an even faster timescale.- I disagree with most comments that the brusque moderation is the cause of SO's problems, though it certainly didn't help. SO has had poor moderation from the beginning. The fundamental value proposition of SO is getting an answer to a question; if you can the same answer faster, you don't need SO. I suspect that the gradual decline, beginning around 2016, is due to growth in a number of other sources of answers. Reddit is kind of a dark horse here, as I began seeing answers on Google to more modern technical questions link to a Reddit thread frequently along with SO from 2016 onwards. I also suspect Discord played a part, though this is harder to gauge; I certainly got a number of answers to questions for, e.g., Bun, by asking around in the Bun Discord, etc. The final nail in the coffin is of course LLMs, which can offer a SO-level answer to a decent percentage of questions instantly. (The fact that the LLM doesn't insult you is just the cherry on top.)- I know I'm beating a dead horse here, but what happens now? Despite stratification I mentioned above, SO was by far the leading source of high quality answers to technical questions. What do LLMs train off of now? I wonder if, 10 years from now, LLMs will still be answering questions that were answered in the halcyon 2014-2020 days of SO better than anything that came after? Or will we find new, better ways to find answers to technical questions?",

Stack Overflow moderator drama felt constant in the later 2010s with endless weird drama spilling across Twitter, Reddit, and the moderator’s personal blogs. That’s about the same time period where it felt like the moderation team was more interested in finding reasons to exercise their moderation power than in maintaining an interesting website.Since about 2020 every time I click a Stack Overflow link I estimate there’s a 50/50 chance that the question I clicked on would be marked as off topic or closed or something before anyone could answer it.

So, it only tells you of the questions that survived at this point in time, this [0] is the actual graph which while describes a curve that shows the same behavior, it's more \"accurate\" of the actual post creation.\n- This is actually a Good Thing™. For years most of the questions went unanswered, non-voted, non-commented, just because there was too many questions happening all the time. So the general trend is not something that the SO community needs to do anything about. Almost 20% of every question asked is marked as duplicate. If people searched... better™ they wouldn't ask as many questions, and so everyone else had more bandwidth to deal with the rest.\n- There has been a shift in help desk style of request, where people starting to prefer discord and such to get answers. This is actually a bad thing because that means that the knowledge isn't public nor indexed by the world. So, information becomes harder to find, and you need to break it free from silos.\n- The site, or more accurately, the library will never die.

Google also continued to do a better and better job of surfacing the right StackOverflow thread, even if the SO search didn't.In 2012 you might search Google, not find what you needed, go to StackOverflow, search and have no better luck, then make a post (and get flamed for it being a frequently-asked question but you were phrasing yours in a different / incorrect way and didn't find the \"real\" answer).In 2017, you would search Google and the relevant StackOverflow thread would be in the top few results, so you wouldn't need to post and ask.In 2020, Google's \"rich snippets\" were showing you the quick answers in the screen real estate that is now used by the AI Overview answers, and those often times had surfaced some info taken from StackOverflow.And then, at the very end of 2022, ChatGPT came along and effectively acted as the StackOverflow search that you always wanted - you could phrase your question as poorly as you want, no one would flame you, and you'd get some semblance of the correct answer (at least for simple questions).I think StackOverflow was ultimately a victim of it's own success. Most of the questions that would be asked by your normal \"question asker\" type of user were eventually \"solved\" and it was just a matter of how easy it was to find them. Google, ChatGPT, \"AI Overviews\", Claude Code, etc have simply made finding those long-answered questions much easier, as well as answering all of the \"new\" questions that could be posed - and without all of the drama and hassle of dealing with a human-moderated site.",

This was pretty much baked in right at the start, and it effectively served as the site's primary user interface for years. And it worked. It worked pretty well! Until it didn't.At some point, Google started surfacing fewer \"tried and true\" Q&A examples and more unanswered, poorly-answered or moderated examples. This broke the fundamental assumption that sat behind SO's moderation - that curating a smaller set of posts was preferable to encouraging more, and newer. Suddenly, Google wasn't a very good UI for SO anymore....and SO didn't really have a fallback. Heck, for a while during this period they actually stopped showing questions on their homepage unless you were already logged in; the core assumption remained that there was a never-ending spring of new people feeding the thing. LLMs weren't the start of the problem, they were the end - the final wake-up call.I don't know that a site like SO can exist without the old Google, the old Internet; it is a product of all that, in the same way that mass-market TV shows were a product of 20th-century broadcast technology, or trade paperbacks of a particular intersection of printing tech and reading habits.[0]: https://www.jerrypournelle.com/reports/jerryp/iron.html",

Sometimes, it’s just easier to ask a human to point you in the right direction.

LLMs never get angry at you, they never complain about incorrect formatting or being too lax in your wording. They have infinite patience for you.

When you’d actually find an answer on StackOverflow, it was often only because you finally found a different way of phrasing your search so that a relevant result came up.

One day we were told the story of how they’d improved load times from around 5min to 30seconds, this improvement was in the mid 90s. The negative responses from clients were instant. The load time improvements had destroyed their company culture. Instead of everyone coming into the office, turning on their computers, and spending the next 10min chatting and drinking coffee the software was ready before they’d even stood up from their desk!The moral of the story, and the quote, isn’t that you shouldn’t improve things. Instead it’s a reminder that the software you’re building doesn’t exist in a PRD or a test suite. It’s a system that people will interact with out there in the world. Habits with form, workarounds will be developed, bugs will be leaned for actual use cases.This makes it critically important that you, the software engineer, understand the purpose and real world usage of your software. Your job isn’t to complete tickets that fulfill a list of asks from your product manager. Your job is to build software that solves users problems.",

We abstract CPU instructions into programming languages so we can think about our problems in more precise terms, such as data structures and functions.It is obviously useful to build abstractions to create even higher levels of precision on top of the language itself.The problem isn’t abstraction, it is clarity of purpose.

I worked there from 2006-2014 in engineering roles and found this statement was particularly jarring: \"User obsession means spending time in support tickets, talking to users, watching users struggle, asking “why” until you hit bedrock\"When I worked on user facing stuff (Maps, Gmail, Accounts) I regularly read the public user support forums and ticket queues looking for complaints, sometimes I even took part in user threads to get more information. What I learned was:• Almost nobody else in engineering did this.• I was considered weird for doing it.• It was viewed negatively by managers and promo committees.• An engineer talking directly to users was considered especially weird and problematic.• The products did always have serious bugs that had escaped QA and monitoring.In theory there were staff paid to monitor these forums, but in practice the eng managers paid little attention to them - think \"user voice\" reports once a quarter, that sort of thing. Partly that's because they weren't technical and often struggled to work out whether a user complaint was just noise or due to a genuine bug in the product, something often obvious to an engineer, so stuff didn't get escalated properly.This general disconnection from the outside world was pervasive. When I joined the abuse team in 2010 I was surprised to discover that despite it having existed for many years, only one engineer was bothering to read spammer forums where they talked to each other, and he was also brand new to the team. He gave me his logins and we quickly discovered spammers had found bugs in the accounts web servers they were using to blow past the antispam controls, without this being visible from any monitoring on our side. We learned many other useful things by doing this kind of \"abuser research\". But it was, again, very unusual. The team until that point had been dominated by ML-heads who just wanted to use it as a testing ground for model training.",

You don't have page-creation privileges and need to open a ticket that will take a week to resolve. You can create the page, but nobody else is able to read it because their machines aren't allowed to install the version of the PageReader™ plugin that your page requires (and you'd need a VP exception to downgrade your PageGenerator™ toolchain to their version). And so on.All these are silent schedule killers that reveal themselves only once you've shipped one full development (and deployment!) cycle.

These allow us to evaluate concrete KPIs, such as number of steps and levels of navigation required for an action, in order to evaluate just how good or bad (or better said, complicated a UX design is).Lets say we apply the HTA. Starting from the top of your navigation level when you want to execute the task, count the number of operations and various levels of navigation you have to go through with the new design, compared to just clicking and correcting the e-mail address in-place? How much time does it take you to write your e-mail in the both cases? How many times do you have to switch back and forth between the main interface and the  context menu google kindly placed for us? \nNow, phase out of your e-mail writing window and evaluate how many various actions you can execute in the Google Workspace.

I started with Perl but moved to PHP 4 pretty soon after. I recognise this problem but I have different take.All the complexity was there 20 years ago, but we ignored it. That doesn't mean it was simpler. It just means we took crazy (with hindsight) risks. Sure, there were no build pipelines like today, but we had scripts we ran to build things. There was Adobe Pagemill for making site wide changes before we deployed a new version. Back in the day we made those changes, did a very brief check that things worked locally, and then manually FTP'd files to a server, breaking it in the process because a user would see the site change as they navigated. Some of us would put up a maintenance page during an update effectively just blocking all the traffic. That's certainly 'simpler', but it's also much worse for the user, and on a site that did things with data potentially risked corrupting a user's records. It was incredible that things didn't break more often. Maybe they did and we just never realised.We didn't have CSS frameworks but we certainly did have our own in-house templates, and they had separate toolchains. As time went on that toolchain mostly migrated to Wordpress and it's template builder plugins. Again, give me Tailwind over that mess.We had Core Web Vitals and SEO in the form of Urchin Stats. We had layout shift but we called it FOUC. We had kind of had srcset, but it was implemented as a set of Macromedia Dreamweaver mm_ JS image preload and swapping functions. <picture> is a lot nicer.Things are just better now. Writing web software is loads of fun. I also leverage LLMs in my code because they're awesome, but not to simplify things. I don't think the complexity is new. I just think it's visible now.",

It's way easier to write code that won't get injected.If you want to slice your designs in Photoshop (ehem, the real OGs used Fireworks) go ahead and use Dreamweaver, go ahead. That said, HTML5 makes not having to use tables for layout easy, not more complex and VS Code has all the good parts of Dreamweaver (trust me, you don't need or want the WYSIWG... if you must, just use inspect elements and move the changes over to the HTML file).I guess all this is to say that web dev is simpler, not more complex for solo devs today. There exists more complicated tooling, but if you're solo-dev'ing something for fun, skip it!EDIT: Also, phpMyAdmin was fun to use but also the best way to get your box popped.

      "abstract": "该讨论围绕“独自坐在咖啡馆的愉悦体验”展开，核心话题是探讨在数字时代中脱离电子设备、享受独处时光的价值。许多用户分享了自己在咖啡馆独处的积极体验，认为这种无干扰的静坐或阅读有助于恢复精力、促进思考，是一种“精神修复”。有人认为这是对抗信息过载和即时满足文化的重要方式，也有用户指出不同地区文化可能影响对此行为的接受度（如美国可能视其为怪异）。\n\n讨论中提到，部分用户通过类似“静坐挑战”或冥想练习来培养专注力，并普遍认同定期脱离电子设备对心理健康有益。分歧点主要在于对“独处行为普遍性”的判断：有用户根据观察指出，咖啡馆中独自工作、阅读的人很常见（可能占30%），这与原文描述的“特殊体验”形成对比；另有用户强调，年轻一代在即时信息环境中成长，可能更难适应这种慢节奏独处。整体上，社区共识是鼓励人们尝试在咖啡馆等场景中享受有意识的独处时光。",

This is just someone discovering something new and sharing it very excitedly.Almost 6-7 years ago, I read about a 30min challenge to sit upright without doing anything in a chair challenge.

I do that all the time...To me, this post is someone's joy and curiosity shared through a well written piece. Everybody discover certain things at different stages of their lives.

Not really a place for meditative thinking. The next time I had to go there, I brought noise cancelling headphones. I wonder what this does to the baristas who are there for many hours.That's why it was so nice when I recently found a nice little mom-and-pop cafe that was quiet. I can't remember if there was music, but if there was, it was very quiet. Again, my partner was at a meeting, but this time I just sat and enjoyed my latte with no damage to my ears.

In boring situations like when I'm on the bus, or waiting in line for something, I'll spin it as an opportunity to spend time with the ole' default mode network.

The problems you have with one of them might not appear in another. The reference compositor, Weston, is not really usable as a daily driver. So while with Xorg you have a solid base, and desktops are implemented on top of that, with Wayland the each desktop is reinventing the wheel, and each of them has to deal with all the quirks of the graphics drivers. I think this is a big problem with the architecture of Wayland. There really should be a standard library that all desktops use. Wlroots aims to be one, but I don't see Gnome and KDE moving to it anytime soon.",

I mostly don't notice.Actually, GPU acceleration was why I initially switched. For whatever reason, this GPU (Radeon VII) crashes regularly under X11 nearly every time I open a new window, but is perfectly stable under wayland. Really frustrating! So, I had some encouragement, and I was waiting for plasma-wayland to stabilize enough to try it properly. I still have the X11 environment installed as a fallback, just in case, but I haven't needed to actually use it for months.Minor pain points so far mostly include mouse acceleration curves being different and screen capture being slightly more annoying. Most programs do this OS-level popup and then so many follow that up with their own rectangle select tool after I already did that. I had some issues with sdl2-compat as well, but I'm not sure that was strictly wayland's fault, and it cleared up on its own after a round of updates.

But, it seems to basically work now and it seems like it's probably the way things are headed.Edit: Actually I've seen some gnome crashes that I think happen when I have mpv running, but I can't say for sure if that's down to Wayland.",

It can crash or make your compositor unstable because if it in itself gets an error allocating GPU memory to spawn the window it can do whatever weird things it was programmed to do in that scenario.I reported it here: https://github.com/NVIDIA/egl-wayland/issues/185Some end users on the NVIDIA developer forums looked into it and determined it's likely a problem for everyone, it's just less noticeable if you have more GPU memory and it's especially less noticeable if you reboot daily since that clears all GPU memory leaks which is also apparent in a lot of Wayland compositors.",

But this is a vanilla compositor (without implementations of any freedesktop desktop protocols), and as-is has no knowledge of things like screenshots or screensharing.If you run any wlroots based compositor except Hyprland you should run xdg-desktop-portal-wlr which does implement the desktop protocols org.freedesktop.impl.portal.Screenshot and org.freedesktop.impl.portal.ScreenCast.If you use Hyprland you should run its fork xdg-desktop-portal-hyprland instead which additionaly has things like file picking built in. Additionally you can/should run xdg-desktop-portal-gtk and/or xdg-desktop-portal-kde to respectively get GTK (\"GNOME\") and QT (\"KDE\") specific implementations for desktop protocols.

My big use case that Wayland enabled was being able to dock my laptop and seamlessly switching apps between displays with different scale factors. And as an added bonus my experience has been that apps, even proprietary ones like Zoom, tend to handle switching scale factors completely seamlessly. It's not that high of importance, but I do like polish like this. (Admittedly, this article outlines that foot on Sway apparently doesn't handle this as gracefully. The protocols enable seamless switching, but of course, they can't really guarantee apps will always render perfect frames.)OTOH though, there are a lot of reasons for projects like GNOME and KDE to want to switch to Wayland, and especially why they want to drop X11 support versus maintaining it indefinitely forever, so it is beneficial if we at least can get a hold on what issues are still holding things up, which is why efforts like the ones outlined in this blog post are so important: it's hard to fix bugs that are never reported, and I especially doubt NVIDIA has been particularly going out of their way to find such bugs, so I can only imagine the reports are pretty crucial for them.So basically, this year the \"only downsides\" users need to at least move into \"no downsides\". The impetus for Wayland itself is mainly hinged on features that simply can be done better in a compositor-centric world, but the impetus for the great switchover is trying to reduce the maintenance burden of having to maintain both X11 and Wayland support forever everywhere. (Support for X11 apps via XWayland, though, should basically exist forever, of course.)",

And finally, nvidia has managed to opensource their driver on Linux - except that it's less performant then the closed source one, and thus a second class citizen, still. Correct me if I am wrong, please.The better path on Linux was always AMD, and still is, to this day, since it simply works without me needing to care about driver versions, or open vs closed source, at all.",

Considering alternatives, likely failures, unlikely failures, etc. In generating the plan you are starting to practice dealing with problem that would come up while implementing it.

I largely agree with your colleagues; the fun part for me, at this point in my career, is the architecture, the interface, the thing that is getting solved for.

There are competing concerns though.I recently wrote a 17x3 reed-solomon encoder which is substantially faster on my 10yo laptop than the latest and greatest solution from Backblaze on their fancy schmancy servers. The fun parts for me were:1. Finally learning how RS works2. Diving in sufficiently far to figure out how to apply tricks like the AVX2 16-element LUT instruction3. Having a working, provably better solutionThe programming between (2) and (3) was ... fine ... but I have literally hundreds of other projects I've never shipped because the problem solving process is more enjoyable and/or more rewarding. If AI were good enough yet to write that code for me then I absolutely would have used it to have more time to focus on the fun bits.It's not that I don't enjoy coding -- some of those other unshipped projects are compilers, tensor frameworks, and other things which exist purely for the benefit of programmer ergonomics. It's just that coding isn't the _only_ thing I enjoy, and it often takes a back seat.I most often see people with (what I can read into) your perspective when they \"think\" by programming. They need to be able to probe the existing structure and inject their ideas into the solution space to come up with something satisfactory.There's absolutely nothing wrong with that (apologies if I'm assuming to much about the way you work), but some people work differently.I personally tend to prefer working through the hard problems in a notebook. By the time the problem is solved, its ideal form in code is obvious. An LLM capable of turning that obvious description into working code is a game changer (it still only works like 30% of the time, and even then only with a lot of heavy lifting from prompt/context/agent structure, so it's not quite a game changer yet, but it has potential).",

          "content": "So, first, most would say the purpose of a zettelkasten is to write. The book goes into this, that your notes eventually just get incorporated into manuscripts, and that your notes should be written as well as if you were writing a manuscript itself.However, what really clicked with me about the book was the hypothesis that true human thinking can only be done externally, through writing, due to the limitations of our brain as a platform. The book lists out things like recency bias and short term memory limitations that get in the way of proper, structural thinking that results in actual insights. Whereas maintaining a zettelkasten, or a simulacrum of one at least, externalizes your thought process and allows you to achieve genuinely your maximum potential for thought.The arguments went beyond the normal ones about the recorded benefits of note-taking for learning, memory, and creativity, and got into the aspects unique to a zettelkasten that make it an enabler for thinking. However the book also pitches this as a productivity boost for authors and researchers, and doesn't really seem to care about people who are just learning for the sake of learning (but it does make a solid case that building a zettelkasten makes learning more fun).Personally I've been reading criticisms of the book as a way to learn how to maintain a zettelkasten that I agree with: it's not specific or clear enough, and it defines too many different kinds of notes (and not all at once; some note types are defined like 3/4 of the way through the book). For me it was just a very convincing argument to stop trying to make my brain do things it isn't good at - stop beating myself up trying to memorize super detailed facts, let my external system handle that. Stop worrying about forgetting bits and bobs of the various books I've read, let my external system slowly create a map of ideas of everything I'm reading. Stop over-optimizing all my note taking systems and just scratch shit into a paper pad, to be indexed as a good zettel later (or just thrown away if I decide it's not helpful).So, though I do intend to use this system to fuel my blog, I think I'd still find value in it just in feeding the conversations I have as well. I'm deeply interested in non traditional politics, leadership, and activism, and with this system I've adopted I'm finding myself make connections I don't think I'd have made before; for example this very idea of externalization and scaffolding of human thought as a means to make up for our flaws, I'm finding similar threads in all sorts of things I read now.If you're interested in zettelkasten, I would recommend a different resource for learning how to actually set one up (just, the internet plus chatgpt is probably fine, plus some FOSS software). I will say, if it's taking too long, whatever you're doing is too complicated. It should take a single click or button press to make a new note, and it should be very easy to scan through your notes and make links every once and a while, and making a link should be no more than a highlight, a button click or press, a search, and a confirmation. If you're anything like me, you may spend more time setting something like this up and agonizing over it than you will using it... that's why I moved from org-roam to trilium, so I could just stop hyper optimizing and start using the damn thing.",

If we do `x[1]` we will get an element of List{int}, from the middle element in the array. If we then further index this with [5], like `x[1][5]` we will get the 5th element of that list.If we look at `int*`, the dereference will peel off the `*` resulting in `int`.So, the way C3 types are declared is the most inside one is to the left, the outermost to the right. Indexing or dereferencing will peel off the rightmost part.C uses a different way to do this, we place `*` and `[]` not on the type but on the variable, in the order it must be unpacked. So given `int (*foo) x[4]` we first dereference it (from inside) int[4], then index from the right.If we wanted to extract a standalone type from this, we'd have `int(*)[4]` for a pointer to an array of 4 integers. For \"left is innermost\", the declaration would instead be `int[4]*`. If left-is-innermost we can easily describe a pointer to an array of int pointers (which happens in C3 since arrays don't implicitly decay) int*[4]*. In C that be \"int*(*)[4]\", which is generally regarded as less easy to read, not the least because you need to think of which of * or [] has priority.That said, I do think that C has a really nice ordering to subscripts, but it was unfortunately not possible to retain it.",

Documentation was still pretty bad last I checked, and that's the bare minimum before I can seriously adopt a new language.C3 feels like home for C developers, there is a real market for language evolutions rather than revolutions (imagine Typescript). The issue is that pretty much nobody knows about C3, most posts about it never get any traction on HN, and it's hard to choose a language with no mind share for anything more serious than toys.Odin is quite nice, has some hype behind it, deservedly. Feels like a nice improvement over C without completely throwing the baby away with the bathwater; perhaps one negative thing might be that it's so opinionated it feels less of a general purpose language than others (with the main dev focused on graphics, there's a lot of syntax sugar for that use case which feels out of place for anyone that is not writing desktop UI or games). Also, while I agree with the author's choice on not rewriting the compiler itself in Odin, as most other languages do, it doesn't strike much confidence that the author would rather develop in C++ than eat his own dog food.I must admit I don't keep up with alternative languages much any more because I believe the Lindy effect to be a force multiplier, and for serious applications it's better to stick with something that is known to work, despite its shortcomings. You only have a few points you can spend on innovation, and if you're developing a complex application, at the very least you want a rock-solid base to build upon.

These complaints have mostly been addressed a long time ago, the solutions were mostly stolen from C where applicable, I refer to Delphi, but I think Lazarus is the same. These are the dot points from the summary:- Since the size of an array is part of its type, it is not possible to write general-purpose routines, that is, to deal with arrays of different sizes.  In particular, string handling is very difficult.There's a TArray<T> type now, it uses generics and can be declared if you like, also lots of other structured types - lists, stacks etc, though the original array type is still available for backwards compatibility. There was also an array of without size to pass as a parameter but TArray is mostly used now.- The lack of static variables, initialization and a way to communicate non-hierarchically combine to destroy the ``locality'' of a program - variables require much more scope than they ought to.Statics are now a thing- The one-pass nature of the language forces procedures and functions to be presented in an unnatural order; the enforced separation of various declarations scatters program components that logically belong together.This can be an issue still, though the one pass is why the compiler is fast.- The lack of separate compilation impedes the development of large programs and makes the use of libraries impossible.Not an issue any more, it has packages and libraries- The order of logical expression evaluation cannot be controlled, which leads to convoluted code and extraneous variables.Not an issue any more it uses the C method- The 'case' statement is emasculated because there is no default clause.Does now, though a case with string alternatives still doesn't exist in Delphi, Lazarus has it.- The standard I/O is defective.  There is no sensible provision for dealing with files or program arguments as part of the standard language, and no extension mechanism.Many different sorts of file access - random, binary etc- The language lacks most of the tools needed for assembling large programs, most notably file inclusion.Not true any more, it has packages and include files (though limited), and the macro facility is very limited, nothing like C's but its not really needed, you can have inline functions for the performance boost macros would give you (stolen from C++)- There is no escape.This refers to the type system, you can use casts just like C nowJust as a counterpoint C still doesn't have a standard string type. Delphi has generics now like C++, and many of the things that are external libraries in C/C++ are just included. If you really need high performance then C is still better, but what I've done in the past is just rewrite bits in C, though the need for this is very infrequent. If you look at comparable things for Delphi in C++ like Qt's slots and signals for example, the Delphi solution is so much more elegant, and Qt is perhaps the only comparable commercial cross platform library to Delphi's Firemonkey. It's really worth a look, times have changed. There's a reason MS hired away Anders Hejlsberg to architect C# and then typescript.",

The proliferation of LLVM has created the perception that writing machine code is an extremely difficult endeavor that should not be pursued by mere mortals. In truth, you can get going writing x86_64 assembly in a day. With a few weeks of effort, it is possible to emit all of the basic x86_64 instructions. I have heard aarch64 is even easier but I only have experience with x86_64.What you then realize is that it is possible to generate quality machine code much faster than LLVM and using far fewer resources. I believe both that LLVM has been holding back compiler evolution and that it is close to if not already at peak popularity. As LLMs improve, the need for tighter feedback loops will necessitate moving off the bloat of LLVM. Moreover, for all of the magic of LLVMs optimization passes, it does very little to prevent the user from writing incorrect code. I believe we will demand more from a compiler backend than LLVM can ever deliver.The main selling point of LLVM is that you gain access to all of the targets, but this is for me a weak point in its favor. Firstly, one can write a quality self hosting compiler with O(20) instructions. Adding new backends should be trivial. Moreover, the more you are thinking about cross platform portability, the more you are worrying about hypothetical problems as well as the problems of people other than yourself.

I believe they are fundamental to programming, and I'd prefer the language to help with syntax and some basic sanity checks; Like, with a dynamical sizeof that to reads the tag so it's easier to malloc the right amount, or a syntax that makes it impossible to access the wrong field (ie. any lightweight pattern matching will do).In other words, I couldn't really figure out the downside you had in mind :)",

For us, it was motivated by a few reasons:- we trained the community around us to look to our website first for the most recent news and information- we did not want a social media platform to be able to cut us off from our community (on purpose or accident) by shuttering accounts or groups- we did not want to require our users have accounts on any 3rd party platforms in order to access our postings- but we still wanted to distribute our messaging across any platforms where large groups of our community members frequently engagedAnother aspect of our process that was specific to our situation and outside of POSSE - we only posted one topic/issue/announcement per blog post. We had a news letter that would summarize each of these. Many organizations like ours would post summaries of many things to a single blog post, basically the same as the newsletter. However, this was cumbersome. For example, if someone in the community had a question, it was much clearer to link to a single post on our site that answered the question AND ONLY answered that question. It made for much better community engagement, better search engine indexing, cleaner content management, and just a better experience for everyone involved.",

There was a time in the past when you could subscribe your Facebook account to external RSS feeds. The entries in those feeds would create new content on your \"Facebook wall\". This essentially let you use any third party that supported RSS to publish content into your Facebook feed.Facebook removed that feature. The effect of this was that people had to create content within facebook instead of outside it. This reoriented the flow of content creation so that it must originate inside of Facebook, removing the ability to use FB as a passive consumer of content created in a workflow where the creators chose the entire flow.IMHO this is one of the biggest steps down ever in FB history.

In hindsight, it is one of the best decisions I have made for my website.  It started out at around 850 lines of code and has gradually grown to roughly 1500 lines.  It handles statically rendering blog posts, arbitrary pages, a guestbook, comment pages, tag listings, per tag RSS feeds, a consolidated RSS feed, directory listing pages and so on.I have found it an absolute joy to maintain this piece of little 'machinery' for my website.  The best part is that I understand every line of code in it. Every line of code, including all the HTML and CSS, is handcrafted.  This gives me two benefits.  It helps me maintain my sense of aesthetics in every byte that makes up the website.  Further, adding a new feature or section to the site is usually quite quick.I built the generator as a set of layered, reusable functions, so most new features amount to writing a tiny higher level function that calls the existing ones.  For example, last month I wanted to add a 'backlinks' page listing other pages on the web that link to my posts and it took me only about 40 lines of new CL code and less than 15 minutes from wishing for it to publishing it.Over the years this little hobby project has become quite stable and no longer needs much tinkering.  It mostly stays out of the way and lets me focus on writing, which I think is what really matters.",

I've found it significantly faster than Jekyll which makes iterating much more pleasant and it's a single binary to download/run vs having to deal with Ruby and its package manager.I'm amazed there still isn't a decent free simple to host CMS solution with live page previews, a basic page builder, and simple hosting yet though. Is there one?There's https://demo.decapcms.org/ (previously Netlify CMS) that you install and run via adding a short JavaScript snippet to a page. It connects to GitHub directly to edit content. You can running it locally or online, but you need some hosting glue to connect to GitHub. Netlify provides this but more options would be nice and I think they limit how many total users can connect on free plans. You can get something like a page builder set up via custom content blocks, but I don't think there's going to be a simple way to render live previews via Hugo (written in Go) in a browser. A JavaScript based SSG would help here, but now you have to deal with the JavaScript ecosystem.@geerlingguy Not a huge deal but noticed (scanning with https://www.checkbot.io/) if you click a tag in a post, it has an unnecessary redirect causing a speed bump that's easy to fix e.g. the post has a link to https://www.jeffgeerling.com/tags/drupal which then redirects to https://www.jeffgeerling.com/tags/drupal/.",

It then did the static site build in-lambda and uploaded the result to the S3 bucket that backs my website.This created a setup that now I can publish to my website from any machine with the ability to edit my git repo. I found it a wonderful mix of WordPress-like ability to edit my site anywhere along with assurance that there's nothing that can technically fail* (well, the failure would likely, ultimately block the deploy, but I made copies of my dependencies where I could, so very unlikely).But really the main thing I love is not maintaining really anything here...

If you want interactivity or feedback, someone (you or a 3rd party service provider) is going to have to run a server.If you're running a server anyway, it seems trivial to serve content dynamically generated from markdown - all an SSG pipeline adds is more dependencies and stuff to break.I know there's a fair few big nerd blogs powered by static sites, but when you really consider the full stack and frequency of work that's being done or the number of 3rd party external services they're having to depend on, they'd have been better by many metrics if the nerds had just written themselves a custom backend from the start.Jeff: I think you'll regret this. I think you'll waste 5 - 10 years trying to shoehorn in basic interactivity like comments, and land on a compromised solution.I also used and managed Drupal and Joomla before I went to SSGs, and then finally realised there's a sensible midpoint for the pain you're feeling: you write/run a simple server that dynamically compiles your markdown - good ol' SSR. It's significantly lighter, cheaper and easier than drupal, and lets you keep all the flexibility and features you need a server for. Don't take cave to the \"self hosted tech was too hard so I took the easy route that forces me to also use 3rd party services instead\" option.SSGing your personal site is the first step to handing it over to 3rd party services entirely IMO.",

      "abstract": "该讨论围绕代码注释中解释“是什么”与“为什么”的平衡问题展开。核心争议在于是否应严格遵循“解释为什么而非是什么”的通用建议。有人认为，在涉及复杂业务逻辑或外部约束时，注释必须解释“是什么”，例如会计软件中的银行转账规则或数据格式中的填充字节，这些领域知识无法从代码本身推断。也有用户指出，清晰的命名本身就能减少对注释的依赖，如变量名应直接表达含义。讨论中提到，过度提取方法（如“Uncle Bob风格”）可能导致代码碎片化，反而增加理解成本。普遍共识是，没有放之四海而皆准的规则，注释应服务于未来的维护者，提供有助于理解业务规则、设计假设或历史背景的提示。分歧主要在于具体场景的权衡：部分用户坚持注释应侧重“为什么”，而另一些则认为在领域知识密集处，明确解释“是什么”同样关键。",

Something like:  // Bank transfers appear as two transactions - a debit here and credit elsewhere\n  // We match them by looking for equal-opposite amounts within a 3-day window\n  \nThat's explaining \"what\" but also implicitly \"why\" - because that's how double-entry works and that's the tolerance banks allow for settlement delays. You can't really extract that into a method name without it becoming absurd.The Uncle Bob approach of extractNameMatchingTransfersWithinSettlementWindow() doesn't actually help - now I need to know what settlement windows are anyway, and I've lost the context of why 3 days.",

          "content": "The article is about comments.  But, more generally, I think the issue here is about naming things.Names capture ideas.  Only if we name something can we (or at least I) reason about it.  The more clear and descriptive a name for something is, the less cognitive load is required to include the thing in that reasoning.TFA's example that \"weight\" is a better variable name than \"w\" is because \"weight\" immediately has a meaning while use of \"w\" requires me to carry around the cumbersome \"w is weight\" whenever I see or think about \"w\".Function names serve the same purpose as variable names but for operations instead of data.Of course, with naming, context matters and defining functions adds lines of code which adds complexity.  As does defining overly verbose variable names: \"the_weight_of_the_red_ball\" instead of \"weight\".  So, some balance that takes into account the context is needed and perhaps there is some art in finding that balance.Comments, then, provide a useful intermediate on a spectrum between function-heavy \"Uncle Bob\" style and function-less \"stream of consciousness\" style.",

The article uses \"context switch\" repeatedly, and in fact never uses the word \"context\" any other way. Since the author acknowledged they're starting a friendly flame war, I'll go ahead and add that the biggest problem with the example code is that it's object-oriented and mutable, which forces a sprawling context on the developers working with it.When I read the replace() method, I was immediately confused because it has no arguments. stringToReplace and alreadyReplaced are properties of the class, so you must look elsewhere (meaning, outside of the function) for their definitions. You also don't know what other bits of the class are doing with those properties when you're not looking. Both of these facts inflate the context you have to carry around in your head.Why is this a class? In the replace() method, there is a call to translate(symbolName). Why isn't there also a SymbolNameTranslator class with a translate() method? Who decided one was simple enough to use a function while the other warrants a class?SymbolReplacer surely could also be done with a function. I understand that this is illustration code, so the usage and purpose is not clear (and the original Bob Martin article does not help). Is there a reason we want these half-replaced strings made available every time we call SymbolReplacer.replace()? If there is, we can get the same data by using a reduce function and returning all of the iterations in a list.A plain, immutable function necessarily contains within it the entire scope of its behavior. It accepts and returns plain data that has no baggage attached to it about the data's purpose. It does one thing only.",

I would still have to read the implementation to be sure.I would prefer encoding this in an Uncle Bob style test. It acts as living documentation that cannot get out of sync with the code and explains the why through execution. For example:  test(\"should_match_debit_with_credit_only_if_within_three_day_settlement_window\", () => {\n      const debit = A_Transaction().withAmount(500.00).asDebit().on(JANUARY_1);\n      const creditWithinWindow = A_Transaction().withAmount(500.00).asCredit().on(JANUARY_4);\n      const creditOutsideWindow = A_Transaction().withAmount(500.00).asCredit().on(JANUARY_5);\n  \n      expect(Reconciliation.tryMatch(debit, creditWithinWindow)).isSuccessful();\n      expect(Reconciliation.tryMatch(debit, creditOutsideWindow)).hasFailed();\n  });\n\nThis way, the 3 day rule is a hard requirement that fails the build if broken rather than a suggestion in a comment block.",

Where others balk at the suggestion that a function or method should never expand past 20 or so lines, I struggle to imagine a way I could ever justify having something that long in my own code.But I definitely don't go about it the same way. Mr. Martin honestly just doesn't seem very good at implementing his ideas and getting the benefits that he anticipates from them. I think the core of this is that he doesn't appreciate how complex it is to create a class, at all, in the first place. (Especially when it doesn't model anything coherent or intuitive. But as Jeffries' Sudoku experience shows, also when it mistakenly models an object from the problem domain that is not especially relevant to the solution domain.)The bit about parameters is also nonsense; pulling state from an implicit this-object is clearly worse than having it explicitly passed in, and is only pretending to have reduced dependencies. Similarly, in terms of cleanliness, mutating the this-object's state is worse than mutating a parameter, which of course is worse than returning a value. It's the sort of thing that you do as a concession to optimization, in languages (like, not Haskell family) where you pay a steep cost for repeatedly creating similar objects that have a lot of state information in common but can't actually share it.As for single-line functions, I've found that usually it's better to inline them on a separate line, and name the result.

I always ask of fellow engineers: why is it unduly difficult to also fix/change the comments as you alter the code they refer to?

I’ve worked with cross-platform frameworks for decades, and have never enjoyed any significant success.For that reason, I’m a bit skeptical of the chances for this framework, but admire the work and dedication that went into it. I sincerely wish them luck.> Most developers learn many languages during their careers and switch between them without a thought.I’ve worked with quite a few, over my 40+ years of experience, but I don’t really “switch without a thought.” There’s always a “context switch” overhead.For example, I am currently writing a Swift app (SwiftUI), with a PHP backend. I keep switching between the two. The biggest mistake I make in PHP, is neglecting trailing semicolons. The next-biggest mistake, is not surrounding if statement evaluations in parentheses. I've been working with PHP a lot longer than Swift, but not anywhere nearly as deeply. Swift is definitely my \"native\" language.My experience is that I can learn a working understanding of a language in a couple of weeks, but it takes years to really get proficient. Think someone that speaks with a heavy accent, and someone fluent.Also, the language is often the least relevant aspect. SDKs, stdlibs, and frameworks are where most of the work lives.

Also, it's not recommended to use GetX, there are some issues with it, a major one being it's like a framework within a framework, and it essentially rewrites a lot of Flutter. Better to use Riverpod, Bloc, Signals, ReArch or something else.For 3D however, I've been looking at Dioxus which is in Rust, they're making a native renderer the same as Flutter (ie not webviews) called Blitz, and they're making good progress on the mobile side. This renderer can embed Bevy, a game engine also written in Rust, and Bevy can also embed Dioxus native, which I thought was really cool, it's bidirectional embedding.I didn't know Expo explicitly made you pay, I thought it was only optional.

So with Kotlin MultiPlatform (KMP), you can compile your Kotlin code as a native executable (instead of a JVM one) or as an iOS framework.

Just like you may share a C++/Rust library between iOS and Android, you can share a KMP library.And Swift is also trying to get there, though it is less mature than Kotlin in that respect.The advantage is that you can cherry-pick the library you want to depend on. Maybe your Swift team wrote advanced logic in Swift and it makes sense for you to call it from Kotlin instead of rewriting it, just like you may depend on a C, C++ or Rust library.

          "content": "Yes building a native app has fewer layers of abstraction and often has better DX than building with a cross-platform framework where you have to work around bugs that inevitably exist in the framework.Cross-platform frameworks I find are more about making sure that your apps stay consistent across platforms over time as they are maintained. Features land on all platforms at the same time.I worked on a product that had been around a long time and had a separate macOS, windows, iOS, android, and web apps. It was a big a big shit-show when product leadership wanted to make large scale changes across all platforms in unison. For that product though it really did have to be native to each platform and I don't think any cross platform framework could have worked for that particular product.Having worked with both native apps & cross-platform frameworks, I do think there is value in cross-platform frameworks as long as the framework allows you to drop down to native platform specific code easily where needed.When it comes to mobile, I think that React Native has some serious benefits:- Fast refresh: incredible DX improvement to be able to just save a file and instantly see the behavior of your app update without rebuilding and reinstalling.\n- Server-driven UI via React Server Components (still experimental): Companies like AirBnB spend a ton of engineering effort to build their own bespoke server-driven UI frameworks. Expo Router is bringing React Server Components to native apps.\n- Automatic deep linking: If you also ship your app for the web using Expo Web & Expo Router, then all your links work perfectly as deep links into your app because your web app and your native app have the exact same routing. If you use next.js with solito for your web app instead of Expo Router, you can also keep your web app in lock-step with your native app without having to use Expo Router for your web app.\n- Over the Air Updates: You can ship changes to your apps instantly without app store review.\n- Can drop down to native easily: These days you can easily build an expo module or if you need really high performance build a nitro module and leverage the native platform APIs where you really need it. I mean look at react-native-vision-camera, it's so much easier to use than the native camera APIs.\n- LLMs are way better at react than they are at swift & kotlin development.If I wanted to build the next TikTok though I'd 100% go full native.",

Flutter solved cross-platform consistency at the engine level years ago while React is still trying to force the DOM to behave.I much prefer a compiled language than the runtime uncertainty of RN. composing native views sounds ideal until an iOS update changes and breaks your layout, or JS bridge chokes during a complex animation edge case that will get you digging through github issues. Flutter is rendering natively on the GPU without the overhead. I prefer shipping a consistent app over debugging why some react-native-* is dropping frames on a budget phone because of JS threadOverall, I find your blatant marketing advertisement of Expo, very suspicious, digging through your past comments I see similar promotion of Expo and RN.

      "abstract": "该讨论围绕Claude Code On-the-Go这一移动编程工具展开，核心话题是探讨如何通过技术实现随时随地进行编程工作，以及这带来的效率提升与生活平衡问题。  \n\n有人认为这种工具将导致白领工作者陷入全天候工作状态，模糊工作与生活的界限。也有用户指出，这类工具实际上能提升工作效率，例如通过tmux+worktree+Claude的组合实现灵活编程，或利用Tailscale等工具简化远程开发。讨论中提到，部分用户倾向于更简单的方案，如直接使用Claude手机应用或Happy、Hapi等开源工具，而另一些用户则推荐Coderemote、Tonkotsu等多种替代方案。  \n\n社区共识在于肯定移动编程工具的便利性，尤其在快速头脑风暴或远程接入已有工作环境时作用明显。但分歧集中在实际应用场景：有用户认为移动设备难以进行深度编程工作，界面限制影响输出质量检查；也有用户强调此类技术本应解放人力、减少工作时间，但当前社会制度可能阻碍这一愿景实现。此外，对于工具选择，用户偏好差异较大，从追求功能丰富到主张简化设置不一而足。",

You get a normal Claude Code experience, but multiplexed.

You have access to the usual Claude Code terminal or a native chat view.- Manage sessions via an app. You have access to a native chat view.It achieves isolation via Git worktrees + a proxy so that containers have access to zero credentials (there aren't even any Claude code creds in the container), which allows you to more safely use bypass all permissions mode.This works better for me that Claude Code on Web because I have control over the environment Claude is running in. I can give it any Docker image I want, I can have it connect to my local network, etc.It's still a WIP (the core bits are there, but it's not polished yet), but I'm hoping it provides a friendlier UX with a similar goal for what the OP has in mind.",

          "content": "Personally, aside from Russian literature, I now prefer American literature, which I think is underestimated in China. I really like that film adaptation, but what the film expresses is something else, not the same as the novel’s core theme.My own understanding is that American literature has at least three themes that are very distinctive and different from Europe(or other countries). One is the depiction of desolation and human loneliness before the American continent was developed into a prosperous land. Another is the pursuit of the American Dream, where people achieve success through relentless struggle. The third is what this novel expresses: what happens after success? Money and career cannot solve all problems; people need more to fill an entire life.I think this kind of contradiction is expressed most clearly in American literature and is also most worth articulating within the American cultural context. This is because its commodity economy and social transformation have been too successful, and it lacks the kind of historical entanglements that Europe has to dilute these problems. As a result, this sense of emptiness stands out even more sharply and demands a more urgent response.I don’t know if there are horror films like this, but I once saw something similar in the TV series WandaVision. She creates an illusion in which she and Vision are a standard middle-class couple, well-fed and well-clothed, with the visuals in black and white. This made it feel like a horror story to me. Why? Because you feel as if they lack nothing, yet they seem like empty shells: their lives are filled with commodities, and all their actions seem stripped of a spiritual dimension.Of course, I don’t think that America’s secular success means it has no spiritual world; rather, the former has been so successful that the latter has been greatly neglected. The purpose of American literature should be to depict, under the success of this commodity economy, what people’s inner lives have actually become, and what they ought to pursue. This, to me, is its most distinctive quality.",

We still feel it's sting in our African American literature nearly axiomatically. Almost by definition, any southern gothic literature will revolve around the effects of slavery, which includes some of our greatest novels.Per the Great Gatsby, the story itself is one of the most powerful arcs out there: The Hero arc with a disillusionment ending. It's not exactly a negative change arc for the protagonist (Nick), but it's meant to feel like one. Nick is physically better off than he starts out, but his opinions and feelings about the world at large are negative. He has grown up, fought the dragon, healed the sick king, beaten the bully, encouraged the coward, and gotten the damsel. But Fitzgerald adeptly makes them all hollow. It's a great and quick read.

On one hand, I admire the fact that great books are read by young people (something which isn't true in my country), but I wonder whether it ends up being counterproductive.Adaptations running away from the main story to focus overtly on stuff that attracts the audience instead of being faithful to the crux of the source material doesn't help either.",

I think you can come away with the deeply shallow understanding of \"the twenties were cool,\" and still be enriched by Fitzgerald's writing style.I don't think anyone has made a good film adaptation of Gatsby and I don't know if anyone will, as long as it's adapted literally. The imagery and iconography of wealthy 1920s America eats so much of anything that tries to adapt it, that they tend to come out feeling shallow, and the writing is so dense that dialogue feels stilted and weird spoken out loud. You'd either need to, in my opinion, lean heavily into both, or abandon both, to make a good adaptation (leaning into both immediately feels like a Wes Anderson movie to me).I think the best adaptation would be to do something like Jobs, where they just take a few scenes from the book and create a movie out of that.",

Of Mice and Men4. Mason and Dixon (everyone’s gonna say “Gravity’s Rainbow” but I think since this is an explicitly American list, the themes of Mason and Dixon of the North/South divide etc put it more squarely on this list)5. To Kill a Mockingbird6. Moby Dick (I’m not the biggest fan of this actually but it’s way better than Gatsby for me)7. Walden (Does this count?  Anyway whatever.  Walden)8. Portrait of a Lady9. Infinite Jest10. Go tell it on the mountainHonestly this is right off the top of my head and looking back I haven’t even got any Hemingway on here, or Ralph Ellison, or Toni Morrison.  I could make a case for Slaughterhouse 5 or Catch-22 or The Naked and the Dead or a bunch of other things. Like even though I think he’s a total tool, Bonfire of the Vanities probably has a good case for being on the listI just genuinely don’t get the fuss about Gatsby.  I’m glad people like it, but there seem far, far better American novels.Edit to add: And yes I did read it. Twice in fact, once in my late teens after I had read a lot of serious literature and thought it was ok but not great and then again in my late 30s because I was sure I must have missed something and was very disappointed to come to the conclusion that I really hadn’t.I have two theories for why maybe people like it so much.  Firstly, because the author is such a stylist and they get strung along by some of the prose.  But when you read a truly jawdropping stylist like for example in my book Joyce or Virginia Woolf or Cormac Macarthy, F. Scott Fitzgerald really doesn’t stand well in that company.Second theory (perhaps cynical) is that it’s the first novel in the US school syllabus that gets really serious literary criticism applied to it and so for a lot of people it is the book that awakens them to the power of literature.  I could totally see that if you had a really great teacher introducing you to proper literature by means of the book you might love the experience and, because of that, the book.",

To me the lens of the book is repeatedly the failure of \"if only I can win them over\" slowly becoming the unsatisfying \"these people were always assholes.\" Whether it's parties, a potential spouse, or important friends, the entire concept of class structure is poison. If people are good people, it shouldn't matter how they present themselves... that's just what I've always taken away from it.

There are good novels everywhere, and no country has the exclusivity of any theme.> One is the depiction of desolation and human loneliness before the American continent was developed into a prosperous land.Of course, classical European literature didn't focus on the American wilderness.\nThough the most famous book on this theme is probably Defoe's Robinson Crusoe. And I enjoyed T.E. Lawrence' Seven Pillars of Wisdom which most people know through the film; the Arabian desert was a good place for loneliness in the wilderness.> Another is the pursuit of the American Dream, where people achieve success through relentless struggle.Like wise, the American Dream is an American myth, which is rarely the focus outside of the USA. But searching success through relentless struggle is a frequent theme. For instance, Stendhal's Le rouge et le noir or Maupassant's Bel-ami. These are from two of the most famous classical French authors, but there are many novels about hard-working people that reach success.> The third is what this novel expresses: what happens after success? Money and career cannot solve all problems; people need more to fill an entire life.As you like Russian literature, I suppose you've read Goncharov's Oblomov and Chekov's theater, especially Uncle Vania. That theme is central in one of the most famous French novel, Flaubert's Madame Bovary. The excellent Italian writer Alberto Moravia also has many novels about this, the most famous being Il disprezzo and my favourite being Gli indifferenti. I also like D'Annunzio's Il piacere much more than The Great Gatsby. I would argue that variations of this theme are universal, with old writings like the Bibles's Qohelet and even more Sumer's Gilgamesh.",

I can read Notes From Underground with no background on the era or the author, and pass my own judgements on the characters. I can read the thoughts of the Underground Man and feel them in any which way that strikes me. The point isn't that Dostoevsky is telling me something, rather he has presented an opportunity for me to explore something I've not explored before. How guided and directed that exploration is remains mostly in the hands of the author, but sometimes all it takes is a presentation of a character and the rest of the work is the reader trying to integrate that character into their own worldview.The most boring art is the art where the author stands next to it and describes what it's about. That's the art where I think \"what's the point of reading\": the author has summarised the intent of his work, presented the canonical reading and disparaged other readings. You might as well just have the intent summarised on a post-it.The most powerful art can be the most \"meaningless\", the art where most of the work is by the reader, searching for connections between what's on the paper and what's in their head. Have you never spent hours with a poem or piece of music, and each retread sparks some new attachment to an experience or feeling?

Over time, Nick and Tom both discover that Jay is not old money but rather most likely a man who amassed wealth by participating in fraud.Tom Buchanan and Jay fight over Daisy, and Tom's side chick is overcome with emotion and is hit by a car. Tom couldn't give a fuck about what happened bc he's a total monster who only cares about money and power. Gatsby takes the blame for the woman's death, and her widower tracks down Gatsby and murders him in revenge.Long story short: pre-Crash capitalism was an orphan-crushing machine. Gatsby got money to pursue love and ended up dead. Buchanan had money and has little positive emotion toward anyone else in the world. Daisy is also concerned with wealth and prestige and allows herself to be mistreated by her husband and thought about leaving him for a richer man.

From analyzing the UNIX manuals and other old files we get the following (not fully complete) picture:We'll skip PDP-7 UNIX, no hierarchical file system yet.UNIX v1 on the PDP-11 had an RF11 fixed head disk (1mb) for / and swap, and an RK05 moving head disk (2.5mb) for /usr (the user directories)By v2 they had added a second RK05 at /sys for things like the kernel, manual pages, and system language stuff like the c compiler and m6.By v3 they added yet another RK05 at /crp for, well, all sorts of crap (literally), including yacc apparently. /usr/bin is mentioned here for the first time.I don't feel like looking up when sbin was first introduced but it is not a Bell Labs thing. possibly BSD or AT&T UNIX? Binaries that one would normally not want to run were kept in /etc, which includes thing like init, mount, umount, getty, but also the second pass of the assembler (as2), or helpers like glob.\nAlso i don't know when /home became canonical but at Bell Labs it was never a thing (plan 9 has user directories in /usr where they had always belonged logically).The lib situation is more difficult. Looks like it started with /usr/lib. By v3 we find the equivalent directory as /lib, where it contains the two passes of the C compiler (no optimization pass back then), C runtime and lib[abc].a (assembler, B, C libraries respectively). /usr/lib had been repurposed for non-object type libraries, think text-preparation and typesetting.By v4 the system had escaped the labs (see the recent news) and at that point everyone modified the system to their taste anyway. Perhaps it should be noted that the v7 distribution (which is the first that is very clearly the ancestor of every modern UNIX) has no /usr/bin, only /bin. /lib and /usr/lib are split however.These are just some rough notes and due to a lack of early material they're still not as accurate as i would like. Also UNIX ran on more than one machine even in the early days (the manuals mention the number of installations) so there must have been some variation anyway.

That meant that you could boot to a small amount of utilities (e.g. fsck) that would let you repair /usr or any other volume if it became corrupted.I think the other poster is correct that stuff like fsck is supposed to go into /sbin because it is a \"system\" binary (but also statically linked since /usr/lib isn't mounted yet) and doesn't make sense to have in user $PATHs since nobody other than root should really be running that one.Regardless, this is all deeply meaningless these days, particularly if you are running \"ephemeral\" infrastructure where if anything goes that wrong you just repave it all and start over.",

I've met many people who have become better people through the 12 steps.I've rewritten them here to give a basic outline and remove any mention of a theistic god. I am not a professional so please forgive me if I've over-simplified or got something wrong. This is how it worked for me at a basic level.1 - Take a look and see if you have a problem. Admit you have a problem if you have one. You can't fix a problem you refuse to recognize.2 - Recognize you've tried to solve it by yourself and have failed. You need help from others.3 - Humble yourself enough to ask for help and be ready to follow direction4 - List all the complaints people have about you and analyze what you might be doing wrong5 - Share your failings, no matter how embarrassing, with a trusted other on the principle that confession is good for the soul and sunlight is the best disinfectant6 - Ask yourself if you're really willing to change. That's not a given. Maybe you aren't.7 - If you are then do what it takes to change. This is going to be different for everyone.8 - Look at step 4 and see who you need to apologize to9 - When you feel you are ready and sufficiently reformed, apologize and make restitution to those on the list you made in step 8. To those that aren't willing to talk, let it go and don't bother them.10 - Make it a practice to do steps 4 through 9 as needed. We believe in progress not perfection.11 - We need to remind ourselves daily that we have a problem that we can't solve alone and that we may need the help of others on any given day. I've heard it called a disease of forgetfulness. We may need to wake up in the morning to read and pray if so inclined. As one person told me, \"carve out a little piece of each day for the 12 steps\"12 - Carry this message to others who are still suffering",

Subsequently, Jesus went off into the desert where he prayed for 40 days.Second is the alchemical process of creating the philosophers stone. Jung argued that this was a description of a process akin to individuation. He believed that what was on the surface metallurgical work (transmuting lead to gold) was actually an obscure formula for remaking the psyche, from whatever was pre-programmed by society into what the individual actually wanted. This process was said to take 40 days.I think a big trap is mistaking who we are from who we appear to be. Some people try to \"seem\" a particular way, thinking that they can only change their appearance, like changing one's clothes. The alchemical view that Jung put forward was a bit more radical, suggesting that we can fundamentally change ourselves.Many people in our modern society experiment on themselves to change their physical bodies and to change their minds.

          "content": "The thing that has always bothered me about the 12-step program is that the end goal seems to always be abstinence, at least in the context of alcoholism.  It seems very strange to me that we treat the symptom, here, not the underlying disease.  Abstaining from alcohol certainly does have positive affects on the life of an alcoholic, but the abuse of alcohol is a symptom, not the root issue.Do we just not yet understand addiction enough to treat it properly?  Are we able to treat addiction (so, for example, someone could successfully limit themselves to low levels of social drinking that don't cause them harm), but doing so is so difficult and hit-or-miss, that we give up and only promote full abstinence as the solution?I also wonder if abstaining from alcohol can have negative affects on life for some people.  Some people use alcohol as a social lubricant; abstaining might mean (detrimentally) less social interaction.  In some cultures/environments, not drinking can be career-limiting (I think this is toxic, but fixing that can take generations).  I think it's fair to say that, on balance, the pros of not drinking to excess all the time will (nearly?) always outweigh any cons of abstinence, but can we do better than either extreme?I poked around at some studies, and what I found was interesting.  It does seem that 12-step programs tend to outperform things like cognitive behavioral therapy (though there is some disagreement here).  But also many of these studies are about whether or not a given treatment achieves abstinence from alcohol, not if it treats the underlying disorder.  So I'm not sure what conclusions (if any) can be drawn.(Ultimately, though, if the 12-step program worked for you, and you're happy with the results and with your life now, that's all that matters!  I don't mean to demean what you've accomplished or throw shade on the life you have now.  I just think this is a very high-profile societal/health issue that we seem to deal with in a very different way than we deal with others, and that seems strange to me.)",

That is, \"do you feel like it's easy to complete tasks?\" is a different question from \"do you tend to complete tasks?\"  The first one is about how it feels: even if you do tend to complete your tasks, you may feel like it's only because you've created your task-completion framework, but it takes concerted, difficult effort to stick with the framework.  The second is about the outcome: you do complete your tasks, and the mechanism behind it isn't relevant.

He wasn’t sure it would work. He worried that his introversion might be too entrenched, but he decided to try. He would be boisterous and witty, he would tell funny stories at parties, he would laugh at himself – that was key.“Roughly speaking,” he recalled, “I was going to become the kind of person you see now.

The reason is simple: greed aka more money via ad pop ups. Why does the current KDE dev team think that pop-ups are acceptable? The python homepage also has a pop-in slider asking for money. I also think this is not acceptable. Why does my browser allow for this, unless ublock origin hero-blocks those vile spam attempts?).This has been a paradigm shift in KDE for the worse. I am also hardly the only one to notice this going downhill:https://jriddell.org/2025/09/14/adios-chicos-25-years-of-kde...It was a huge mistake to try to make KDE a political entity. Then again by deprecating the xorg-server, the current KDE team already showed that they don't quite care about the users.> It was around that same time when I made the “Contributing to KDE is easier than you think” series of blog posts.I think contributing to KDE has become much harder. Now you have people be involved in KDE whom you may not be able to relate or cooperate with. How could I ever cooperate with someone who thinks Robin Hood daemon-widgets coercing people for money is acceptable? To me this is not acceptable. I have absolutely nothing against donations, mind you - the issue has never been about donations. The issue has always been about what software should be about. Software should not be about putting pressure on people  - it should be about enabling people. This is what Mr. Nate does not understand, but arguably the problem with KDE go much deeper than just Nate; all the \"systemd-only folks\" like David. It feels like some strange kind of people took over KDE. We also saw this some years ago with GNOME and GTK, though admittedly GNOME has always been more fedora/red-hat controlled, even way before systemd. (And here, the issue is not so much about GNOME, but that GTK is now factually a GNOMEy-toolkit only.)> Moving on, 2020 was pretty active. I started contributing to KDE web, while still being a Reddit modAh yes, the old conflict-of-interest. People can not be critical of #kde because these KDE devs will ruthlessly censor and ban people with another opinion. Been there, done that; though this is also heavily a problem specific to reddit in general, not just for KDE alone.> All that just to say that I’m finally content with the state of beginner onboarding docs in our KDE Developer Platform.Ok, patting yourself on the shoulder here. I don't know how well his contributions have been so I am not judging prematurely one way or the other, but in general I dislike self-promo. I believe the only ones able to judge that are unaffiliated people aka users of that documentation. In general I find the documentation in open source projects to be horrible, but perhaps KDE docs are better than average, and improvements to documentation (if they are real improvements) are always a good thing. But just get ebassi to talk about how epic the GTK documentation is - then you check it out, and it is beyond imagination how abysmal it is. So in general I find those self-promo statements hugely problematic. They don't match reality. The best documentation in general, oddly enough, I found when people wrote working examples with explanations; learning from these has almost always been better than looking at official documentation and noticing how so many things are missing or lacking or of low quality. A wonderful example can be seen with regard to python + GTK3 and GTK4. Barely anyone wrote GTK4-specific parts, neither documentation; yes I know laszka tutorials for GTK3 and now compare it to GTK4 while also using google search. You notice such a huge discrepancy here, almost as if nobody switched to GTK4 even years after. And the documentation is also different in quality (it has gotten better in the last 2 years, but it is very strange how external contributors do more work here than the GTK devs, but that's a question you can ask the GTK dev team since they are also responsible for any drop in adoption when they constantly willy-nilly deprecate everything - soon to get another deprecation cycle with GTK5.

In addition to all the inconvenience, when such centralized systems are blocked, casual users switch to explicitly backdoored options. The advertised IMs are tied to phone numbers, introducing both privacy and availability issues. Almost nothing of that is available from Linux distributions' system repositories. Integration with other software and infrastructures is lacking. Dealing with multiple specialized tools is more of a headache even for expert users, especially when their added benefits do not make much sense given one's threat model. OpenPGP/GnuPG is more resilient and versatile than those, still usable where those are not.I think such an article would seem more convincing, at least to me, if more sensible alternatives were proposed. Ideally without the advice to not encrypt email, without assumptions of continued availability of all the online services, of trust to certain third parties, and so on. Or it could be just a plain criticism without suggestions, which would still be somewhat informative.Edit: there is another list of alternatives in a sibling comment, advising against (well, actually being quite hostile towards, and generally impolite) usage of what I had in mind as one of the possible more sensible alternatives: XMPP with OMEMO. Though upon skimming the criticism of that, I have not found it particularly convincing, either, and it just looks like some authors try to be particularly provocative/edgy.",

Each AuxData has a type identifier (e.g. \"ssh-v2\", \"age-v1\", \"minisign-v0\", but on the client-side, you can have friendly aliases like just \"ssh\" or \"age\"). The type identifier tells the server (and other clients) which \"extension\" to use to validate that the data is valid. (This is to minimize the risk of abuse.)As this project matures, it will be increasingly easy to do this:  // @var pkdClient -- A thin client-side library that queries the Public Key Directory\n  // @var age -- An implementation of age\n  async function forwardSecureEncrypt(file, identity) {\n    const agePKs = await pkdClient.FetchAuxData(identity, \"age\");\n    if (agePKs.length === 0) {\n      throw new Error(\"No age public keys found\");\n    }\n    return age.Encrypt(file, agePKs[0]);\n  }\n\nAnd then you can send the encrypted file in an email without a meaningful subject line and you'll have met your stated requirements.(The degree of \"forward secure\" here depends on how often your recipient adds a new age key and revokes their old one. Revocation is also published through the transparency log.)However, email encryption is such a mess that most people don't quite appreciate, so I'm blogging about that right now. :)Also, Filippo just created a transparency-based keyserver for age, fwiw: https://words.filippo.io/keyserver-tlog/",

          "content": "I think the two cases are different. The EFAIL researchers were suggesting that the PGP code (whatever implementation) should throw an error on an MDC integrity error and then stop. The idea was that this would be a fix for EFAIL in that the modified message would not be passed on to the rest of the system and thus was failsafe. The rest of the system could not pass the modified message along to the HTML interpreter.In the gpg.fail case the researchers suggested that GPG should, instead of returning the actual message structure error (a compression error in their case), return an MDC integrity error instead. I am not entirely clear why they thought this would help. I am also not sure if they intended all message structure errors to be remapped in this way or just the single error. A message structure error means that all bets are off so they are in a sense more serious than a MDC integrity error. So the suggestion here seems to be to downgrade the seriousness of the error. Again, not sure how that would help.In both cases the researchers entirely ignored regular PGP authentication. You know, the thing that specifically is intended to address these sorts of things. The MDC was added as an afterthought to support anonymous messages. I have come to suspect that people are actually thinking of things in terms of how more popular systems like TLS work. So I recently wrote an article based on that idea:* https://articles.59.ca/doku.php?id=pgpfan:pgpauthIt's occurred to me that it is possible that the GnuPG people are being unfairly criticized because of their greater understanding of how PGP actually works.

Like that by a government.> (Centralization itself is a red herring. One may as well claim that PGP is centralized, given that there’s only one prominent keyserver still limping around the Internet.)How is it a red herring?> For messaging/secure communication, use Signal. It’s open source.From my point of view, it is complicated by Signal being blocked here (and it being centralized helped to establish such blocking easily), likely the phone number verification won't work here, it is not available without a phone, and it is not available from F-Droid repositories on top of that. Currently money transfers are also complicated, so finding some foreign service that would help to circumvent phone number verification is also complicated, and not something I would normally do even without that. All this Internet blocking is a new development here, but such availability issues due to centralization were anticipated for a long time, and are a major motivation behind federated or distributed systems. Some mail servers are also being blocked, but generally mail still works, and less of a pain to use.> For file encryption, use age. It’s open source and has multiple mature implementations by well-regarded cryptographic engineers.> For signing, use minisign, or Sigstore, or even ssh signing. All are open source.These I find to be okay. Having to install them in addition to GnuPG that is usually already available, but that is to be expected; they are available at least from Debian repositories, so not something to complain about when considering alternatives. Likewise with the key sharing: not getting to reuse OpenPGP's PKI, and will have to replace that somehow, but it is not like it is used widely and consistently anyway, so perhaps not much of a loss in practice. Likewise with familiarity of the users: I would expect a little more friction with such tools, compared to GnuPG, but not much more. And I don't see actual usage downsides apart from those. Though the benefits also seem a bit uncertain, but generally that sounds like a switch that makes sense to consider.",

Last year, I decided to be done with Twitter and Instagram and make my own timelines of text and photo posts with similar layouts. Initially, I thought it might require separate instances of GoToSocial and Pixelfed. It turned out that Hugo could do it all with a few tweaks, and now they are live at hsu.cy/notes and hsu.cy/gallery, respectively.

The cool thing about LLMs is that they appear capable of doing this - rather than a machine that just regurgitates black-and-white facts, they seem to be capable of dealing with nuance and gray areas, providing insight, and using logic to reach a conclusion from ambiguous data.But this is the biggest misconception and flaw of LLMs. LLMs do not have opinions. That is not how they work. At best, they simulate what a reasonable answer from a person capable of having an opinion might be - without any consistency around what that opinion is, because it is simply a manifestation of sampling a probability distribution, not the result of logic.And what most people call sycophancy is that, as a result of this statistical construction, the LLM tends to reinforce the opinions, biases, or even factual errors, that it picks up on in the prompt or conversation history.",

Once the model observes the assistant persona being a certain way, now it Has An Opinion. I think most people who've used LLMs at all are familiar with this dynamic.This is distinct from having a preference for one thing or another -- I wouldn't call a bias in the probability manifold an opinion in the same sense (even if it might shape subsequent opinion formation). And LLMs obviously do have biases of this kind as well.I think a lot of the annoyances with LLMs boil down to their poor opinion-management skill. I find them generally careless in this regard, needing to have their hands perpetually held to avoid being crippled.

Try instructing any model to name a random color a hundred times and you'll be surprised that it consistently chooses 2-3 colors, despite technically using random sampling. That's opinion.

Completely irrelevant to my point but answering as if a bunch of reviewers are gonna quibble with its outputWith regards to mental health issues, of course nobody on Earth (not even the patients with these issues, in their moments of grounded reflection) would say that that the AI should agree with their take. But I also think we need to be careful about what's called \"ecological validity\". Unfortunately I suspect there may be a lot of LARPing in prompts testing for delusions akin to Hollywood pattern matching, aesthetic talk etc.I think if someone says that people are coming after them the model should not help them build a grand scenario, we can all agree with that. Sycophancy is not exactly the concern there is it? It's more like knowing that this may be a false theory.

They're a much better rubber ducky than my cat, who is often interested but only meows in confusion.I'll also share a strategy my mentor once gave me about seeking help. First, compose an email stating your question (important: don't fill the \"To\" address yet). Second, value their time and ask yourself what information they'll need you solve the problem, then add that. Third, conjecture their response and address it. Forth, repeat and iterate, trying to condense the email as you go (again, value their time). Stop if you solve, hit a dead end (aka clearly identified the issue), or \"run out the clock\".  90+% of the time I find I solve the problem myself. While it's the exact same process I do in my head writing it down (or vocalizing) really helps with the problem solving process.I kinda use the same strategy with LLMs. The big difference is I'll usually \"run out the clock\" in my iteration loop. But I'm still always trying to iterate between responses. Much more similar to like talking to someone. But what I don't do is just stream my consciousness to them. That's just outsourcing your thinking and frankly the results have been pretty subpar (not to mention I don't want that skill to atrophy). Makes things take much longer and yields significantly worse results.I still think it's best to think of them as \"fuzzy databases with natural language queries\".

A misinterpreted command or bug could lead to serious consequences. The risk feels different from something like k9s, since AWS resources frequently include stateful databases, production workloads, and infrastructure that's far more difficult to restore.I appreciate the effort that went into this project and can see the appeal of a better CLI experience. But personally, I'd be hesitant to use this even for read-only operations. The direct AWS cli/console at least eliminates a potential failure point.Curious if others have thoughts on the risk/benefit tradeoff here.",

I’m curious: what kinds of projects are you guys currently working on that genuinely push you out of your comfort zone?I had a small epiphany a couple of weeks ago while thinking about robot skin design: using conductive 3D-printed structures whose electrical properties change under strain, combined with electrical impulses, a handful of electrodes, a machine-learning model to interpret the measurements, and computational design to optimize the printed geometry.While digging into the literature, I realized that what I was trying to do already has a name: proprioception via electrical impedance tomography. It turns out the field is very active right now.https://www.cam.ac.uk/stories/robotic-skinThat realization led me to build a Bergström–Boyce nonlinear viscoelastic parallel rheological simulator using Taichi. This is far outside my comfort zone. I’m just a regular programmer with no formal background in physics (apart from some past exposure to Newton-Raphson).Interestingly, my main contribution hasn’t been the math. It’s been providing basic, common-sense guidance to my LLM. For example, I had to explicitly tell it which parameters were fixed by experimental data and which ones were meant to be inferred. In another case, the agent assumed that all the red curves in the paper I'm working with referred to the same sample, when they actually correspond to different conducting NinjaFlex specimens under strain.Correcting those kinds of assumptions, rather than fixing equations, was what allowed me to reproduce the results I was seeking. I now have an analytical, physics-grounded model that fits the published data. Mullins effect: modeled. Next up: creep.We’ll see how far this goes. I’ll probably never produce anything publishable, patentable, or industrial-grade. But I might end up building a very cheap (and hopefully not that inaccurate), printable proprioceptive sensor, with a structure optimized so it can be interpreted by much smaller neural networks than those used in the Cambridge paper.If that works, the gesture will have been worth it.",

Maybe you don't need to, or care to, but it's definitely not what's sustainable in long-term product companies.AI is a force multiplier - it makes bad worse, it _can_ make good better. You need even more engineering disciplines than before to make sure it's the latter and not the former. Even with chaining code quality MCP's and a whole bunch of instructions in AGENTS.md, there's often a need to intervene and course adjust, because AI can either ignore AGENTS.md, or because whatever can pass code quality checks does not always mean the architecture is something that's solid.That being said, I do agree our job is changing from merely writing code, to more of a managerial title, like you've said.

At this stage, absolute physical accuracy isn’t really the point. By design, the system already includes a neural model in the loop (via EIT), so the notion of \"accuracy\" is ultimately evaluated through that learned representation rather than against raw physical equations alone.What I need instead is a model that is faithful to my constraints: very cheap, easily accessible materials, with properties that are usually considered undesirable for sensing: instability, high hysteresis, low gauge factor. My bet is that these constraints can be compensated for by a more circular system design, where the geometry of the sensor is optimized to work with them.Bridging the gap to reality is intentionally simple: 3D-print whatever geometry the simulator converges to, run the same strain/stress tests on the physical samples, and use that data to fine-tune the sensor model.Since everything is ultimately interpreted through a neural network, some physical imprecision upstream may actually be acceptable, or even beneficial, if it makes the eventual transfer and fine-tuning on real-world data easier.",

Injectable scaffolds for cartilage repair that integrate both bioactivity and sufficiently robust physical properties to withstand joint stresses offer a promising strategy. We report here on a hybrid biomaterial that combines a bioactive peptide amphiphile supramolecular polymer that specifically binds the chondrogenic cytokine transforming growth factor β-1 (TGFβ-1) and crosslinked hyaluronic acid microgels that drive formation of filament bundles, a hierarchical motif common in natural musculoskeletal tissues. The scaffold is an injectable slurry that generates a porous rubbery material when exposed to calcium ions once placed in cartilage defects. The hybrid material was found to support in vitro chondrogenic differentiation of encapsulated stem cells in response to sustained delivery of TGFβ-1. Using a sheep model, we implanted the scaffold in shallow osteochondral defects and found it can remain localized in mechanically active joints. Evaluation of resected joints showed significantly improved repair of hyaline cartilage in osteochondral defects injected with the scaffold relative to defects injected with the growth factor alone, including implantation in the load-bearing femoral condyle. These results demonstrate the potential of the hybrid biomimetic scaffold as a niche to favor cartilage repair in mechanically active joints using a clinically relevant large-animal model.\"",

If someone has a V8 zero-day exploit, they can break out of the sandbox.But putting aside zero-day exploits for a moment, workerd is designed to be a sandbox. That is, applications by default have access to nothing except what you give them. There is only one default-on type of access: public internet access (covering public IPs only). You can disable this by overriding `globalOutbound` in the config (with which you can either intercept internet requests, or just block them).This is pretty different from e.g. Node, which starts from the assumption that apps should have permission to run arbitrary native code, limited only by the permissions of the user account under which Node is running.Some other runtimes advertise various forms of permissions, but workerd is the only one I know of where this is the core intended use case, and where all permissions (other than optionally public internet access, as mentioned) must be granted via capability-based security.Unfortunately, JavaScript engines are complicated, which means they tend to have bugs, and these bugs are often exploitable to escape the sandbox. This is not just true of V8, it's true of all of them; any that claims otherwise is naive. Cloudflare in production has a multi-layer security model to mitigate this, but our model involves a lot of, shall we say, active management which can't easily be packaged up into an open source product.With all that said, not all threat models require you to worry about such zero-day exploits, and you need to think about risk/benefit tradeoffs. We obviously have to worry about zero-days at Cloudflare since anyone can just upload code to us and run it. But if you're not literally accepting code directly from anonymous internet users then the risk may be a lot lower, and the overall security benefit of fine-grained sandboxing may be worth the increased exposure to zero-days.",

I had a sort of déjà vu reading this, having been at Kurzweil’s Siggraph keynote in 2000. He was predicting this very scenario - the singularity would bring nanobots that make humans immortal. His talk made an impression on my young mind. It wasn’t until later that I realized Kurzweil was just peddling the fountain of youth, and was somewhat unscrupulous about it…He has been pitching the idea that human longevity is accelerating. For example, scroll to the very bottom of this essay and check out the plot: https://www.writingsbyraykurzweil.com/the-law-of-acceleratin...Looks plausible for a minute, but when you start to think about it, you realize he has conflated longevity with average lifespan, and that it cannot possibly be a mistake, he’s not that ignorant or careless. The plot is missing data points that were easily available when it was made, data points that would completely contradict the trend line he put in the graph. Turns out human longevity hasn’t really budged for ten thousand years, but average lifespan has changed a lot, due to infant mortality and sanitation and vaccines and lower infant mortality and less war and more science.I think a lot of the graphics in that article are equally sketchy when you look a little closer, and a lot of his predictions from 2000 are already orders of magnitude off, so I have no trust in anything Kurzweil writes or predicts. But given the state of the earth today, maybe it’s a good thing that significant longevity or immortality isn’t just around the corner? It’s a fun thought experiment and a nice story though.",

          "content": "I like Karpathy, we come from the same lineage and I am very proud of him for what he's accomplished, he's a very impressive guy.In regards to deep learning, building deep learning architecture is one of my greatest joys in finding insights from perceptual data.  Right now, I'm working on spatiotemporal data modeling to build prediction systems for urban planning to improve public transportation systems.  I build ML infrastructure too and plan to release an app that deploys the model in the wild within event streams of transit systems.It took me a month to master the basics and I've spent a lot of time with online learning, with Deeplearning.ai and skills.google.  Deeplearning.ai is ok, but I felt the concepts a bit dated.  The ML path at skills.google is excellent and gives a practical understanding of ML infrastructure, optimization and how to work with gpus and tpus (15x faster than gpus).But the best source of learning for me personally and makes me a confident practitioner is the book by Francois Chollet, the creator of Keras.  His book, \"Deep Learning with Python\", really removed any ambiguity I've had about deep learning and AI in general.  Francois is extremely generous in how he explains how deep learning works, over the backdrop of 70 years of deep learning research.  Francois keeps it updated and the third revision was made in September 2025 - its available online for free if you don't want to pay for it.  He gives you the recipe for building a GPT and Diffusion models, but starts from the ground floor basics of tensor operations and computation graphs.  I would go through it again from start to finish, it is so well written and enjoyable to follow.The most important lesson he discusses is that \"Deep learning is more of an art than a science\". To get something working takes a good amount of practice and the results on how things work can't always be explained.He includes notebooks with detailed code examples with Tensorflow, Pytorch and Jax as back ends.Deep learning is a great skill to have.  After reading this book, I can recreate scientific abstracts and deploy the models into production systems.  I am very grateful to have these skills and I encourage anyone with deep curiosity like me to go all in on deep learning.",

          "content": "IMO that's a bit of a strange video for Karpathy to start with, perhaps even to include at all.Let me explain why ...Neural nets are trained by giving them lots of example inputs and outputs (the training data) and incrementally tweaking their initially random weights until they do better and better at matching these desired outputs. The way this is done is by expressing the difference between the desired and current (during training) outputs as an error function, parameterized by the weights, and finding the values of the weights that correspond to the minimum value of this error function (minimum errors = fully trained network!).The way the minimum of the error function is found is simply by following its gradient (slope) downhill until you can't go down any more, which is hopefully the global minimum. This requires that you have the gradient (derivative) of the error function available so you know what direction (+/-) to tweak each of the weights to go in the downhill error direction, which will bring us to Karpathy's video ...Neural nets are mostly built out of lego-like building blocks - individual functions (sometimes called nodes, or layers) that are chained/connected together to incrementally transform the neural network's input into it's output.  You can then consider the entire neural net as a single giant function outputs = f(inputs, weights), and from this network function you can create the error function needed to train it.One way to create the derivative of the network/error function is to use the \"chain rule\" of calculus to derive the combined derivative of all these chained functions from their own individual pre-defined derivative functions. This is the way that most machine learning frameworks, such as TensorFlow, and the original Torch (pre-PyTorch) worked. If you were using a machine learning framework like this then you would not need Karpathy's video to understand how it is working under the hood (if indeed that is something you care about at all!).The alternative, PyTorch way, of deriving the derivative of the neural network function, is more flexible, and doesn't require you to build the network just out of nodes/layers that you already have the derivative functions for. The way PyTorch works is to let you just use regular Python code to define your neural network function, then record this python code as it runs to capture what it is doing as the definition of neural network function. Given this dynamically created neural network function, PyTorch (and other similar machine learning frameworks) then uses a built-in \"autograd\" (automatic gradient) capability to automatically create the derivative (gradient) of your network function, without someone having had to do that manually, as was the case for each of the lego building blocks in the old approach.What that first video of Karpathy's is explaining is how this \"autograd\" capability works, which would help you build your own machine learning framework if you wanted to, or at least understand how PyTorch is working under the hood to create the network/error function derivative for you, that it will be using to train the weights. I'm sure many PyTorch users happily use it without caring how it's working under the hood, just as most developers happily use compilers without caring about exactly how they are working. If all you care about is understanding generally what PyTorch is doing under the hood, then this post may be enough!For an introduction to machine learning, including neural networks, that assumes no prior knowledge other than hopefully being able to program a bit in some language, I'd recommend Andrew Ng's Introduction to ML courses on Coursera. He's modernized this course over the years, so I can't speak for the latest version, but he is a great educator and I trust that the current version is just as good as his old one that was my intro to ML (building neural nets just using MATLAB rather than using any framework!).",

Computational Efficiency and Real-Time Application* *Deep Learning (DL):* The paper proposes a *ConvLSTM* (Convolutional Long Short-Term Memory) framework designed for high computational efficiency. It is specifically intended to provide real-time predictions, enabling dispatchers to evaluate operational decisions instantly.\n* *Agent-Based Models (ABM):* While the paper does not use ABMs, it contrasts its DL approach with traditional *\"computationally intensive simulations\"*—a category that includes microscopic agent-based models. ABMs often require significant processing time to simulate individual train and passenger interactions, making them less suitable for immediate, real-time dispatching decisions during operations.### 2. Modeling Methodology* *Deep Learning (DL):* The approach is *data-driven*, learning spatiotemporal patterns and the propagation of train headways from historical datasets. It captures spatial dependencies (between stations) and temporal evolution (over time) through convolutional filters and memory states without needing explicit rules for train behavior.\n* *Agent-Based Models (ABM):* These are typically *rule-based and bottom-up*, modeling the movement of each train \"agent\" based on signaling rules, spacing, and train-following logic. While highly detailed, they require precise calibration of individual agent parameters.### 3. Handling Operational Control* *Deep Learning (DL):* A key innovation in this paper is the direct integration of *target terminal headways* (dispatcher decisions) as inputs. This allows the model to predict the downstream impacts of a specific control action (like holding a train) by processing it as a data feature.\n* *Agent-Based Models (ABM):* To evaluate a dispatcher's decision in an ABM, the entire simulation must typically be re-run with new parameters for the affected agents, which is time-consuming and difficult to scale across an entire metro line in real-time.### 4. Use Case Scenarios* *Deep Learning (DL):* Optimized for *proactive operational control* and real-time decision-making. It is most effective when large amounts of historical tracking data are available to train the spatiotemporal relationships.\n* *Agent-Based Models (ABM):* Often preferred for *off-line evaluation* of complex infrastructure changes, bottleneck mitigation strategies, or microscopic safety analyses where the \"why\" behind individual train behavior is more important than prediction speed.",

          "content": "What a clueless post. Even ignoring their massive overstatement of the difficulty and hardware complexity of hardware mapping tables, they appear to not even understand the problems solved by mapping tables.Okay, let us say you have a physical object store. How are the actual contents of those objects stored? Are they stored in individual, isolated memory blocks? What if I want to make a 4 GB array? Do I need to have 4 GB memory blocks? What if I only have 6 GB? That is obviously unworkable.Okay, we can solve that by compacting our physical object store onto a physical linear store and just presenting a object store as a abstraction. Sure, we have a physical linear store, but we never present that to the user. But what if somebody deallocates a object? Obviously we should be able to reuse that underlying physical linear store. What if they allocated a 4 GB array? Obviously we need to be able to fragment that into smaller pieces for future objects. What if we deallocated 4 GB of disjoint 4 KB objects? Should we fail to allocate a 8 KB object just because the fragments are not contiguous? Oh, just keep in mind the precise structure of the underlying physical store to avoid that (what a leaky and error-prone abstraction). Oh, but what about if there are multiple programs running, some potentially even buggy, how the hell am I supposed to keep track of the shared physical store to keep track of global fragmentation of the shared resource?Okay, we can solve all of that with a level of indirection by giving you a physical object key instead of a physical object \"reference\". You present the key, and then we have a runtime structure that allows us to lookup where in the physical linear store we have put that data. This allows us to move and compact the underlying storage while letting you have a stable key. Now we have a mapping between object key and linear physical memory. But what if there are multiple programs on the same machine, some of which may be untrustworthy? What if they just start using keys they were not given? Obviously we need some scheme of preventing anybody from using any key. Maybe we could solve that by tagging every object in the system with a list of every program allowed to use it? But the number of programs is dynamic and if we have millions or billions of objects, each new program would require re-tagging all of those objects. We could make that list only encode \"allowed\" programs which would save space and amount of cleanup work, but how would the hardware do that lookup efficiently and how would it store that data efficiently?Okay, we can solve that by having a per-program mapping between object key to linear physical memory. Oh no, that is looking suspiciously close to the per-program mapping between linear virtual memory to linear physical memory. Hopefully there are no other problems that will just result in us getting back to right where we started. Oh no, here comes another one. How is your machine storing this mapping between object key to linear physical memory? If you will remember from your data structures courses, those would usually be implemented as either a hash table or a tree. A tree sounds too suspiciously close to what currently exists, so let us use a hash table.Okay, cool, how big should the hash table be? What if I want a billion objects in this program and a thousand objects in a different program? I guess we should use a growable hash table. All that happens is that if we allocate enough objects we allocate a new, dynamically sized storage structure then bulk rehash and insert all the old objects. That is amortized O(1), just at the cost of a unpredictable pause on potentially any memory allocation which can not only be gigantic, but is proportional to the number of live allocations. That is fine if our goal is just putting in a whole hardware garbage collector, but not really applicable for high performance computing. For high performance computing we would want worse case bounded time and memory cost (not amortized, per-operation).Okay, I guess we have to go with a per-program tree-based mapping between object key to linear physical memory. But it is still a object store, so we won, right? How is the hardware going to walk that efficiently? For the hardware to walk that efficiently, you are going to want a highly regular structure with high fanout to both maximize the value of the cache lines you will load and to reduce the worst case number of cache lines you need to load. So you will want a B-Tree structure of some form. Oh no, that is exactly what hardware mapping tables look like.But it is still a object store, so we won, right? But what if I deallocated 4 GB of disjoint 4 KB objects? You could move and recompact all of that memory, but why? You already have a mapping structure with a layer of indirection via object keys. Just create a interior mapping within a object between the object-relative offsets and potentially disjoint linear physical memory. Then you do not need physically contiguous backing, you can use disjoint physical linear store to provide the abstraction of a object linear store.And now we have a per-program tree-based mapping between linear object address to linear physical memory. But what if the objects are of various sizes? In some cases the hardware will traverse the mapping from object key to linear object store, then potentially need to traverse another mapping from a large linear object address to linear physical memory. If we just compact the linear object store mappings, then we can unify the trees and just provide a common linear address to linear physical memory mapping and the tree-based mapping will be tightly bounded for all walks.And there we have it, a per-program tree-based mapping between linear virtual memory and linear physical memory one step at a time.",

Other allocations fragment the address space, so there might be adequate space in total, but no individual contiguous chunk is large enough.

They went out of business several months ago. I don't have the inside scoop, but I expect the biggest issue is that they were trying to sell it as a performance improvement (hardware based memory allocation), which it probably was... but also they would have been starting from a slower base anyway. \"38% faster than linear memory\" doesn't sound so great when your chip is half as fast as the competition to start with.It also didn't protect objects on the stack (afaik) unlike CHERI. But on the other hand it's way simpler than CHERI conceptually, and I think it handled temporal safety more elegantly.Personally I think Rust combined with memory tagging is going to be the sweet spot.

In modern development, we often rely on the \"scaffolding\" of high-level abstractions, assuming everything is fixable later. But here, the hardware was \"Steel\" (unchangeable).Akiman’s solution—using a single-pixel \"pencil tile\" from Guile’s calves to manually mask an 'l' into an 'i'—is a legendary example of \"Mitate\" (見立て): the Japanese art of seeing one thing as another to overcome an absolute limitation.In the world of Japanese \"Shinise\" (long-established companies), this obsessive attention to detail is never called \"inefficient.\" It is the only path to survival across centuries. Akiman famously insisted on the muscular thickness of Chun-Li’s thighs, refusing to compromise because he believed the \"Steel\" (core logic) of a fighter lay in that foundation. If the legs were weak, the character’s soul was dead.SF2 remains a legend 30 years later because its creators treated every pixel as \"Steel\" that carried existential risk. This article proves that while \"speed buys information,\" only this level of \"Forging\" buys true longevity. Most fast-scaled software disappears in three years; the \"World Warrier\" still stands after thirty because of that one-pixel pencil.",

          "content": "Super interesting to hear about those concepts from another language/culture. While you are right that in software pretty much everything is \"scaffolding\" in the semiconductor the scaffolding vs steel applies.To simplify it as much as possible, to make a chip multiple masks are created for different layers. The top layers are metal(scaffolding) and the base layers are silicon(steel). The metal layer masks are much cheaper to make than the base layers. So we add extra unused cells in the base layers and then if there are issues we try to fix them only in the metal layers.It's not really an art nowadays, since it's been refined so much with tooling and processes. But your analogy is very applicable, I might try to refer to it in the future if I ever need to explain the concept to someone.",

      "abstract": "该讨论围绕3D打印技术在微缩模型（尤其是战棋游戏领域）的应用现状与早期预测的落差展开。核心话题是探讨3D打印是否如过去所预言的那样彻底改变了业余爱好者制作微缩模型的方式，以及其在当前实际应用中的局限与价值。\n\n讨论中提到，许多用户认同3D打印确实对战棋游戏的部分环节产生了革命性影响，例如地形模型的制作变得极为便捷和经济，也有人指出它在历史题材战棋或小众定制化需求中非常流行。有用户认为，对于大多数理性的使用者而言，3D打印机并非要取代大规模生产，而是填补了无法量产或高度个性化零件的制造空白。\n\n然而，也存在不同观点。有用户通过自身经历说明，消费级3D打印机并未实现早期炒作的全部愿景，其应用仍受限于技术、材料和生活环境（如公寓居住者顾虑树脂气味）。也有用户指出，3D打印只是复杂制作流程中的一个环节，虽然大幅简化了某些步骤，但整体过程依然需要多方面的技能和努力。\n\n社区的一个普遍共识是，3D打印已成为模型爱好者社群中一个强大且日益普及的工具，尤其在小批量、定制化和特定场景模型制作上优势明显。但大家也基本同意，它并未导致传统商业微缩模型（如战锤）被完全取代，两者更多是互补关系。",

          "content": "This was a very enjoyable read for me. I’ve never played 40K but have always been impressed with the craftsmanship and dedication of the community.I remember a lot of the early hype around 3D printing, most of which hasn’t panned out where the consumer-hobbyist-level machines are concerned. My local game shop makes a lot of cool 3D printed stuff and sells it online or at cons, but even Etsy is now cracking down on prints of “commodity” STLs. IIRC under their new policy, you can’t sell a print you didn’t design yourself. This is ostensibly to cut down on the huge quantity of identical articulated toys.But the bigger takeaway (i.e., the kit car Ferrari analogy), is similar to how I’ve been thinking about AI image generation lately. You can walk down the streets of New York and buy a counterfeit Birkin bag or Rolex from a street vendor. Are knockoffs “disrupting” the market? I guess, in a way. But I think they also make the authentic item _more_ valuable by being so cheap and fake by comparison. AI-generated “Ghibli” pictures are the same.",

I also had a lot more free time than I do now.Nowadays I own a 3D printer (Prusa 4S+ with nobs on upgraded from a 3) and an IT company.16 year old me would have committed ... a minor crime ... for the printer but given that IT was a Commodore 64, I'm not sure how I would have driven the thing.However a 16 y/o me today with a 3D printer probably would be printing armies out of filament.  I used to make plastic models too and saved up for several months to buy a double action air brush.  My printer can churn out a small scale tank that rivals a Tamiya effort from back in the day.

Then there was an intermediate phase in 1997 where Netscape 4.0 (document.layers) and IE 4.0 (document.all) each used their own model.The first universal standard was the W3C DOM Level 1 Recommendation (Oct 1998). Major browsers adopted this slowly: IE 5.0 (Mar 1999) offered partial support, while Konqueror 2.0 (Oct 2000) and Netscape 6.0 (Nov 2000) were the first W3C-compliant engines (KHTML and Gecko).Safari 1.0 (2003), Firefox 1.0 (2004), and Chrome 1.0 (2008) launched with native standard DOM support from version 1.0.Currently most major browser engines follow the WHATWG DOM Living Standard to supports real-time feature implementation.",

          "content": "> Would be writing something like \"DOM in the modern browsers\" more correct then?No, I don't think so. I don't know why the GP comment is at the top beyond historical interest. If you continue with your plans mentioned elsewhere to cover things like layout, rendering, scripting, etc, under this standard almost everything will have to have the \"in modern browsers\" added to it.Part of the problem is the term \"DOM\" is overloaded. Fundamentally it's an API, so in that sense it only has meaning for a browser to \"have a DOM\" if it supports scripting that can use that API. And, in fact, all browsers that ever shipped with scripting have had some form of a DOM API (going back to the retroactively named DOM Level 0). That makes sense, because what's the point of scripting if it can't interact with page contents in some way?So, \"Lynx remains a non-DOM browser by design\" is true, but only in the sense that it's not scripted at all, so of course it doesn't have DOM APIs, the same way it remains a non-canvas browser and a non-webworker browser. There's no javascript to use those things (it's a non-cssanimation browser too).There's a looser sense of the \"DOM\", though, that refers to how HTML parsers turn an HTML text document into the tree structure that will then be interpreted for layout, rendering, etc.The HTML spec[1] uses this language (\"User agents must use the parsing rules described in this section to generate the DOM trees from text/html resources\"), but notes it's for parsing specification convenience to act as if you'll end up with a DOM tree at the end of parsing, even if you don't actually use it as a DOM tree (\"Implementations that do not support scripting do not have to actually create a DOM Document object, but the DOM tree in such cases is still used as the model for the rest of the specification.\")In that broader sense, all browsers, even non-modern ones (and Lynx) \"have a DOM\", since they're all parsing a text resource and turning it into some data structure that will be used for layout and rendering, even if it's the very simple layouts of the first browsers, or the subset of layout that browsers like Lynx support.[1] https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/parsing.html",

Some defaults are pretty common, and could be maybe considered de-facto standard, but I wouldn't want to draw the line where \"most\" browsers agree or should agree.Personally, I have my browser set up to \"guess\" as little as possible, never do the search from the URL bar unless explicitly told to do so using a dedicated search keyword (plus I still keep separated auto-collapsing search bar). I have disabled all guessing for TLDs, auto prepending www. In short, when I enter \"whatever\" into my URL bar, my browser tries to load to \"http://whatever/\", what could be my local domain and I could get an answer -- it is is a valid URL after all.  In a related note, I strongly doubt that any browser does the web search for \"localhost\".The rabbit hole could naturally go even deeper: for example most browser still interpret top-level dataURIs. It is not that long browsers interpreted top-level `javascript:` URIs entered into URL bar, now surviving in bookmarklets but taken from all users for the sake of a pitiful \"self-XSS prevention\".So I would be really careful telling what happens -- or, god forbid, should happen -- when someone types something into their URL bar: \"whatever\" could be a search keyword with set meaning:\n- it could be bound to http URL (bookmark),\n- the bookmark URL could have a `%s` or `%S` and then it would do the substitution,\n- it could be a `javascript:…` bookmark (\"bookmarklet\"/\"favelet\"; yes, most browser still let you do that, yet alas, mostly fail to treat CSP in a way it would remain operational).\n- It could be a local domain.The fact that, statistically, \"most\" browsers will do a web search using some default engine is probably correct but oversimplifying claim that glosses over quite a lot of interesting possibilities.",

Every morning standup started with \"What did you get DONE yesterday? What are you going to get DONE today?\" If you couldn't point to a specific feature which was FULLY DONE end-to-end, there would be a long awkward pause or the boss would make a negative remark. Their definition of DONE was 100% polished, no iteration; had to be perfect the first time; the boss would sit with you through a very tense one-on-one meeting and go through the detailed requirements for each task word-by-word. The company environment was set up to make it difficult for you to ask question; like the author of this article described so this made it difficult to meet all requirements exactly on the first attempt, let alone given the short deadlines.I struggled to make sense of the full horror of this industry until Christmas this year; I was at my parent's house and was using their microwave (a popular brand) and it was the most awful UX I had ever seen on a microwave. I literally could not imagine a worse UX if I tried. You couldn't just pin-in the seconds/minutes and press start, you could't extend the start time mid-way through the process and it was hard to start as you had to push a bunch of specific intermediate buttons whose labels made no sense and it would start a fan which kept running even after the microwave was done; I had to pull the plug to get it to shut up... Anyway, this made me think \"Wow, my industry sucks... This is the worst software and UX I've ever seen and yet people are still buying this machine! The guy who designed the UX for this thing probably got a promotion too and now giving orders to others about how to do good UX...\" This isn't just an outlier 'microwave industry' thing though; this dynamic is present everywhere in the whole tech industry; this was just a particularly striking example.",

I was pulled into a $150k rebrand and Webflow project where the latter accounted for 40% of the budget.  It was a splashy home page that violated every rule of good page design (scroll jacking, progress bars, heavy animations) and 3 inner page templates that was essentially a set of the same blocks ordered differently (thanks Boostrap!!).I was ultimately surprised how much time actually went into that Webflow project.  Like OP mentioned (in the article) clients never make time to participate or give early feedback.  Most of the time they don’t even know how being actively involved in the process will save them money.  Is it the service providers job to educate them?TLDR; like the article says.

          "content": "Wireguard is cool, but there's some reasons it's worth considering OpenVPN (why I still use OpenVPN anyways). First, OpenVPN has kernel mode now (called DCO, which I think Netgate maybe has upstreamed to FreeBSD); I've found it's performance on hardware with AES-NI on Linux is actually often better than wireguard. Second, there's a lot of quality of life things that just work on OpenVPN that you've got to use a ton of duct tape to make work with Wireguard, a major one being handling DNS record change (think especially dynamic DNS, which is likely if this is IPv4 and a residential connection). This is a huge pain with Wireguard, but just works on OpenVPN. Similarly if you have multiple WAN links, like I do, for OpenVPN it's just two connection stanzas and it largely just works. Again for Wireguard you're adding lots of duct tape to make it work right. I know Wireguard is the new hot thing, but it leaves a lot to be desired in the resiliency and features department.",

The estimated coefficients are linear in y, and this also makes it easy to give standard errors and such for the coefficients!Also, this is what you would do if you were doing Maximum Likelihood assuming Gaussian distributed noise in y, which is a sensible assumption (but not a strict assumption in order to use least squares).Also, in a geometric sense, it means you are finding the model that puts its predictions closest to y in terms of Euclidean distance.

The biggest reason is that minimizing sum of squares of residuals gives the maximum likelihood estimator if you assume that the error is iid normal.If your model is different (y = Ax + b + e where the error e is not normal) then it could be that a different penalty function is more appropriate. In the real world, this is actually very often the case, because the error can be long-tailed. The power of 1 is sometimes used. Also common is the Huber loss function, which coincides with e^2 (residual squared) for small values of e but is linear for larger values. This has the effect of putting less weight on outliers: it is \"robust\".In principle, if you knew the distribution of the noise/error, you could calculate the correct penalty function to give the maximum likelihood estimate.

LOL.I like this project--The layout is well designed--image area, editable code window, and compact navigation--pleasantly proportioned with an excellent demonstration of thematic font choice. And, surprise, some are interactive.I imagine it's an excellent way to organize and store your collection of animation algos. The 'about' is detailed (https://play.ertdfgcvb.xyz/abc.html#play:about) and interesting to read.Thanks to OP for sharing.",
