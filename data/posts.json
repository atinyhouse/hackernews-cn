I used to date a guy who works at infra department in DB and based on what he told me, I couldn't believe how inefficient and massively complicated DB is.

          "content": "> The train starts moving. The driver announces there are “issues around Bonn.” He does not specify what kind. No one asks. We have learned not to ask.This is one of those issues I keep mulling about; it seems train operators (and airliners for that matter) tend to avoid being technically specific about operation problems, and just say \"problems\" and - if they are kind - where the problem is.  And I cannot decide whether this is the wrong or right approach: how much information is too much?  The argument is that travellers don't care why the train cannot move or why it is delayed, they just want to know when the next train is.The problem - however - is that train operators come off looking like idiots, when they really aren't.  As an example, the S-trains around Copenhagen have recently switched to a CBTC signal system, which has increased punctuality to 97% (below 3 minutes, cancelled trains counted).  At cold temperatures, railway points (or switches, if you will) might become inoperable, as their mechanism freeze (of course, there are systems to prevent this, but can occur anyway).  This happened this November on the S-train lines, but the announcement was \"signal failure\"; which meant the train operator (DSB) (and the railway owner (Banedanmark)) kind of looked a bit stupid, since the whole point of CBTC was to eliminate signal failures entirely (in fact, if you're being pedantic, since CBTC has _no_ signals, there technically cannot be any signal failures), and had promised as much.But - then again - travellers really just wanted to know what the next train was, but I still think train operators are doing themselves a disservice by being oblique about the actual problem.  Particularly when a problem lasts for several days, \"technical problems\" just makes people think their engineers are incompetent, when in reality they have no idea about the severity of the problem (because it is not communicated).I may of course be biased here, since I have a high interest in how trains operate, but friends of mine - whose interest is far lessen compared to mine - are also frustrated by these opaque messages; and I think the reason is a strong sense of lack of control - since (assuming one made it to the station on time) up until this point, the passenger have done everything right, and yet the system failed, and now they are not privy as to why.",

Been a little while but I personally played as a goalie myself.The person kept making the comment that she couldn't see/find the puck and it made it frustrating to watch.As a goalie, not being able to see the puck is pretty normal (especially with big bodies trying to screen you).What I told her was that what matters a lot more than where the puck is, is where it's going to be in about two seconds. But the next best thing is to know where the puck is now.If you can't see the puck then look at the players and as a last resort, look at the ref. 99% of the time they will be looking at the puck. Look where they're looking and soon enough it will appear.I think this applies very much to this whole Google question.The puck is gone (or on the way to the other side of the rink) and everyone is confused where it is or where it's going.Look where everyone is looking and you'll find your answer there. It may not be in the same form as Google adwords, but the game is the same. Leveraging attention.The tactics were different during the phonebook days (it was having your business start with the letter \"A\") as opposed to Google and will be different for the next thing as well.From what I can tell, everyone seems to be looking at chatbots and vertical, shortform video.

          "content_cn": "I recently took someone to go and watch a hockey game. Been a little while but I personally played as a goalie myself.The person kept making the comment that she couldn't see/find the puck and it made it frustrating to watch.As a goalie, not being able to see the puck is pretty normal (especially with big bodies trying to screen you).What I told her was that what matters a lot more than where the puck is, is where it's going to be in about two seconds. But the next best thing is to know where the puck is now.If you can't see the puck then look at the players and as a last resort, look at the ref. 99% of the time they will be looking at the puck. Look where they're looking and soon enough it will appear.I think this applies very much to this whole Google question.The puck is gone (or on the way to the other side of the rink) and everyone is confused where it is or where it's going.Look where everyone is looking and you'll find your answer there. It may not be in the same form as Google adwords, but the game is the same. Leveraging attention.The tactics were different during the phonebook days (it was having your business start with the letter \"A\") as opposed to Google and will be different for the next thing as well.From what I can tell, everyone seems to be looking at chatbots and vertical, shortform video. Not sure how that plays out in terms of advertising, but in terms of the answer to this article's question, that seems like a good place to start."

Windows 11 is very slow and chrome is a bad experience. Firefox doesn't make it better.I also find that gnome and cosmic de are not exactly great at memory.

The minor UI issues (like context menus getting rendered in place as windows which breaks niche window managers) are nothing compared to the hours required to brute force the right Wine/Proton setup for every game to make it work.Most of the games that now work in unofficial GOG launchers only work because Valve p人工智能d someone to make games run well on Wine, either by directly using Proton or by using one of the many libraries Valve has directly p人工智能d for work for."

That is the reason for issues when it comes to vibe coders having low quality code. But that is not the limitation of technology but the user (at this stage). Basically think of it this way everyone is the grandma that has been handed a palm pilot to use to get things done. Grandma needs an iPhone not a palm pilot but the problem is that we are not in that territory yet. So now consider the people who were able to use the palm pilot very successfully and well, they were few and they were the exception, but they existed. Same here. I have been using coding agent for over 7 months now and have written zero lines of code, in fact I don't know how to code at all. But i have been able to architect very complex software projects from scratch. Text to speech , automated llm benchmarking systems for testing all possible llama.cpp sampling parameters and more, and now im building my own agentic framework from scratch. All of these things are possible and more without writing one line of code yourself. But it does require understanding how to use the technology well to get this done."

The electrical interface between the phone modem and the eSIM is the same as with a real SIM card, and the eSIM can run the same applications as a real SIM card, so at this point you can buy smartcards that can be swapped between devices and run eSIM applications. esim.me, 9esim and the \"sysmocom eUICC for eSIM\" (seems to be the most open/friendly at this point) are some of the options. Most of them offer an app for management, but there are also standardized interfaces.SIM cards have always been secure elements that the provider trusts. With an eSIM, you can already own that secure element and the provider can provision it with their application. You can even have the applications from multiple providers on the same physical secure element.The major advantage is now that the expensive and time-consuming part of provisioning a new mobile service (sending out a physical SIM card) can be replaced with a few standardized API calls. This is cheaper (which makes the extra cost some providers charge for an eSIM look quite silly) and a lot quicker, which enables new business models for short-lived cell connection services.A world where all cell service providers offered eSIMs would be slightly nicer.

          "content": "So, the article doesn't discuss this, but there's actually a really good reason to make up and use custom elements: the browser can hydrate their dynamic behaviour automatically. For example, suppose you have:    <div class=expander>\n      <button aria-expanded=false>Expand</button>\n      <!-- Some other stuff here -->\n    </div>\n\nAnd you have some JS that handles the expander's behaviour:    for (const expander of document.querySelectorAll('.expander')) {\n      const btn = expander.querySelector('button');\n\n      btn.addEventListener('click', () => {\n        btn.ariaExpanded = 'true';\n      });\n    }\n\nThis will work fine for `.expander` divs that are already in the page when the event handler is set up. But suppose you dynamically load new expander divs, what then? Your event handler is not going to retroactively set up their click listeners too.Custom elements solve exactly this problem. You can now do:    <expander-elem>\n      <button aria-expanded=false>Expand</button>\n      <!-- Some other stuff here -->\n    </expander-elem>\n\nAnd then set up the listener:    customElements.define('expander-elem', class extends HTMLElement {\n      connectedCallback() {\n        const btn = this.querySelector('button');\n\n        btn.addEventListener('click', () => {\n          btn.ariaExpanded = 'true';\n        });\n      }\n    });\n\nAnd the browser will ensure that it always sets up the listeners for all of the expanders, no matter whether they are loaded on the page initially or dynamically injected later. Without this you would have had to jump through a bunch of hoops to ensure it. This solves the problem elegantly.",

Corporations do not behave like scaled up humans, so analyzing them with human intuitions about motivation, learning, or sanity is often misleading.A corporation is not a person with beliefs, emotions, or a unified model of the world. It is a distributed optimization process composed of agents with local incentives, asymmetric information, and weak feedback loops. What looks like irrationality at the system level is often perfectly rational behavior at the component level. The result is behavior that would be pathological in a human but is structurally normal for an organization.This is why corporations often resemble what we would call psychopathic traits if observed in individuals. Lack of empathy is not a moral failure, it is an emergent property of decision making that is mediated through abstractions like metrics, quarterly targets, and legal responsibility shields. Harm is externalized because the feedback is delayed, diluted, or borne by parties not represented in the decision loop. There is no felt guilt because there is no felt anything.Humans update beliefs through direct experience and social feedback. Corporations update through KPIs, incentive realignment, and legal or market pressure. Those signals are coarse, lagging, and often gamed. So you get persistence in obviously harmful or stupid behavior long after any individual inside the company privately knows it is wrong. The system cannot feel embarrassment or regret. It can only respond when the gradient changes.This also explains why appealing to realism at the individual level often misses the point. Understanding what is likely to happen is useful, but the likelihoods themselves are shaped by incentive topology, not by shared understanding. Even when everyone agrees something will fail, it can still proceed if failure is locally optimal or diffused. Conversely, things that seem impossible can happen quickly when incentives snap into alignment, regardless of prior beliefs.So cynicism versus optimism is not about mood here. It is about whether you model organizations as intentional agents or as blind selection processes. Once you adopt the latter view, a lot of so called dysfunction stops looking like incompetence and starts looking like exactly what the system was designed to produce.The depressing part is not that corporations become bureaucratic.

          "content": "I think the terminology objection here is mostly semantic and misses what the author is actually claiming.No one experiences their own beliefs as “cynical” or “optimistic.” Everyone believes they are being realistic. A cynic does not think “I am distorting reality negatively.” He thinks “this is how things really are.” The labels cynic and optimist are almost always imposed by observers, not chosen by the believer. When someone calls himself a cynic, what he usually means is that others perceive his conclusions, which he believes are factual, as negative.So the core claim is not that cynicism is a mood or an attitude to aspire to. The claim is that reality itself is often negative, and that people who arrive at pessimistic conclusions are sometimes closer to the truth than people who default to hopeful narratives. Calling that “realism” instead of “cynicism” does not change the substance of the argument.There is also actual empirical work here, not just vibes. In psychology this shows up under what is sometimes called depressive realism. Multiple studies starting with Alloy and Abramson in the late 1970s found that mildly depressed subjects were more accurate than non depressed subjects at judging contingency, control, and likelihood in certain experimental settings. Non depressed subjects systematically overestimated their influence and future outcomes, while depressed subjects were closer to objective probabilities. Later work refined this and showed the effect is bounded and context dependent, but the core point survived: positive mental health is often associated with optimistic bias, not neutral accuracy.More broadly, a large literature on optimism bias and self serving bias shows that psychologically healthy people tend to overestimate success, underestimate risk, and interpret ambiguous evidence in their favor. That bias is adaptive and motivating, but it is still a bias. People who lack it tend to have more internally consistent and stable world models, even if those models are less emotionally pleasant.So saying “realism is neutral” is true in the abstract, but psychologically misleading. Humans do not converge on realism by default. They converge on motivated belief. When someone repeatedly reaches pessimistic conclusions across domains, it is at least plausible that they are sampling reality with fewer affective filters, not merely indulging in a negative personality trait.That does not mean cynicism is virtuous, or that it should guide social behavior. Tact and parrhesia are social strategies. They are orthogonal to whether your internal model of the world is accurate. You can be accurate and tactful, accurate and abrasive, inaccurate and pleasant, or inaccurate and hostile. Mixing those axes together is what creates confusion here.The real disagreement is not about tone or attitude. It is about whether optimistic distortions are a feature or a bug. Psychology suggests they are a feature for well being, but a bug for accuracy.",

Here some thoughts:> approach of separating the simulation and presentation layers isn't all that uncommonI agree that some level of separation is is not that uncommon, but games usually depend on things from their respective engine, especially on things like datatypes (e.g. Vector3) or math libraries. The reason I mention that our game is unique in this way is that its non-rendering code does not depend on any Unity types or DLLs. And I think that is quite uncommon, especially for a game made in Unity.> Most games don't ship on the mono backend, but instead on il2cppI think this really depends. If we take absolute numbers, roughly 20% of Unity games on Steam use IL2CPP [1]. Of course many simple games won't be using it so the sample is skewed is we want to measure \"how many players play games with IL2CPP tech\". But there are still many and higher perf of managed code would certainly have an impact.We don't use IL2CPP because we use many features that are not compatible with it. For example DLC and mods loading at runtime via DLLs, reflection for custom serialization, things like [FieldOffset] for efficient struct packing and for GPU communication, etc.Also, having managed code makes the game \"hackabe\". Some modders use IL injection to be able to hook to places where our APIs don't allow. This is good and bad, but so far this allowed modders to progress faster than we expected so it's a net positive.> In modern Unity, if you want to achieve performance, you'd be better off taking the approach of utilizing the burst compiler and HPC#Yeah, and I really wish we would not need to do that. Burst and HPC# are messy and add a lot of unnecessary complexity and artificial limitations.The thing is, if Mono and .NET were both equally \"slow\", then sure, let's do some HPC# tricks to get high performance, but it is not! Modern .NET is fast, but Unity devs cannot take advantage of it, which is frustrating.By the way, the final trace with parallel workers was just C#'s workers threads and thread pool.> Profiling the editor is always a fools errandMaybe, but we (devs) spend 99% of our time in the editor. And perf gains from editor usually translate to the Release build with very similar percentage gains (I know this is generally not true, but in my experience it is). We have done many significant optimizations before and measurements from the editor were always useful indicator.What is not very useful is Unity's profiler, especially with \"deep profile\" enabled. It adds constant cost per method, highly exaggerating cost of small methods. So we have our own tracing system that does not do this.> I've seen a lot of mention around GC through this comment section, and professional Unity projects tend to go out of their way to minimize these at runtimeYes, minimizing allocations is key, but there are many cases where they are hard to avoid. Things like strings processing for UI generates a lot of garbage every frame. And there are APIs that simply don't have an allocation-free options. CoreCLR would allow to further cut down on allocations and have better APIs available.Just the fact that the current GC is non-moving means that the memory consumption goes up over time due to fragmentation. We have had numerous reports of \"memory\" leaks where players report that after periodic load/quit-to-menu loops, memory consumption goes up over time.Even if we got fast CoreCLR C# code execution, these issues would prevail, so improved CG would be the next on the list.[1] https://steamdb.info/stats/releases/?tech=SDK.UnityIL2CPP",

BUT having said that, if you're into performance but unwilling to use the tools available then that's on you.From the article it seems that you're using some form of threading to create things, but you don't really specify which and/or how.The default C# implementations are usually quite poor performance wise, so if you used for example the default thread pool I can definitively say that I've achieved a 3x speedup over that by using my own thread pool implementation which would yield about the same 30s -> 12s reduction.Burst threading/scheduling in general is also a lot better than the standard one, in general if I feed it a logic heavy method (so no vectorization) then I can beat it by a bit, but not close to the 3x of the normal thread pool.But then if your generation is number heavy (vs logic) then having used Burst you could probably drop that calculation time down to 2-3 seconds (in the same as if you used Vector<256> numerics).Finally you touch on GC, that's definitely a problem. The Mono variant has been upgraded by them over time, but C# remains C# which was never meant for gaming. Even if we had access to the modern one there would still be issues with it. As with all the other C# libraries etc., they never considered gaming a target where what we want is extremely fast access/latency with no hiccups. C# in the business world doesn't really care if it loses 16ms (or 160ms) here and there due to garbage, it's usually not a problem there.Coding in Unity means having to go over every instance of allocation outside of startup and eliminating them, you mention API's that still need to allocate which I've never run into myself.

BUT having s人工智能d that, if you're into performance but unwilling to use the tools av人工智能lable then that's on you.From the article it seems that you're using some form of threading to create things, but you don't really specify which and/or how.The default C# implementations are usually quite poor performance wise, so if you used for example the default thread pool I can definitively say that I've achieved a 3x speedup over that by using my own thread pool implementation which would yield about the same 30s -> 12s reduction.Burst threading/scheduling in general is also a lot better than the standard one, in general if I feed it a logic heavy method (so no vectorization) then I can beat it by a bit, but not close to the 3x of the normal thread pool.But then if your generation is number heavy (vs logic) then having used Burst you could probably drop that calculation time down to 2-3 seconds (in the same as if you used Vector<256> numerics).Finally you touch on GC, that's definitely a problem. The Mono variant has been upgraded by them over time, but C# rem人工智能ns C# which was never meant for gaming. Even if we had access to the modern one there would still be issues with it. As with all the other C# libraries etc., they never considered gaming a target where what we want is extremely fast access/latency with no hiccups. C# in the business world doesn't really care if it loses 16ms (or 160ms) here and there due to garbage, it's usually not a problem there.Coding in Unity means having to go over every instance of allocation outside of startup and eliminating them, you mention 应用程序接口's that still need to allocate which I've never run into myself.

What are you going to do about that other than possibly log the issue in the destructor? W人工智能t and try ag人工智能n until it can be closed?If you really must force Java semantics into it with ch人工智能ns of exception causes (as if anybody handled those gracefully, ever) then you can. Get the current exception and store a reference to the new one inside the first one. But I would much rather use exceptions as little as possible."

Is that right?Why not consider the opposite, that the most beneficial quantity of glutamate receptors could be somewhere below the typical amount? If that were true, then we could try to help others reduce their glutamate receptor level to become healthier and more successful (and a little more autistic).If we found, say, an association between a lower level of neurological characteristic X and concert-level piano skill, then those who aspire to play that instrument at an elite level might try to decrease X. The fact that most of us are rubbish piano players would not be evidence that lower levels of X are harmful, but very much the opposite."

I wanted to find out, and had some spare time over the holidays.Z80-μLM is a character-level language model with 2-bit quantized weights ({-2,-1,0,+1}) that runs on a Z80 with 64KB RAM. The entire thing: inference, weights, chat UI, it all fits in a 40KB .COM file that you can run in a CP/M emulator and hopefully even real hardware!It won't write your emails, but it can be trained to play a stripped down version of 20 Questions, and is sometimes able to maintain the illusion of having simple but terse conversations with a distinct personality.--The extreme constraints nerd-sniped me and forced interesting trade-offs: trigram hashing (typo-tolerant, loses word order), 16-bit integer math, and some careful massaging of the training data meant I could keep the examples 'interesting'.The key was quantization-aware training that accurately models the inference code limitations. The training loop runs both float and integer-quantized forward passes in parallel, scoring the model on how well its knowledge survives quantization. The weights are progressively pushed toward the 2-bit grid using straight-through estimators, with overflow penalties matching the Z80's 16-bit accumulator limits. By the end of training, the model has already adapted to its constraints, so no post-hoc quantization collapse.Eventually I ended up spending a few dollars on Claude API to generate 20 questions data (see examples/guess/GUESS.COM), I hope Anthropic won't send me a C&D for distilling their model against the ToS ;PBut anyway, happy code-golf season everybody :)",

But if there was as much tr人工智能ning data in Pascal as there is in C it would be pretty cool to see benchmarks, I have a hunch Pascal would do better.(Sorry for the bad pascal I haven't programmed in ages)"

Possible problems show up in reviews by being different to expectation. \"Hey, where's XYZ?\", \"Why are you querying the database in the constructor?\"Onboarding between teams becomes a lot easier, ramp up time is smaller.Without consistency, you end up with lots of small pockets of behavior that cause downstream problems for the org as a whole.Every team needs extra staff to handle load peaks, resulting in a lot of idle devs.Senior devs can't properly guess where the problematic parts of fixes or features would be. They don't need to know the det人工智能ls, just where things will be _difficult_.Every feature requires coordination between the teams, with queuing and prioritizing until local staff become av人工智能lable.Finally, consistency allows classes of bugs to be fixed once. Fix it once and migrate everyone to the new style."

I'll ask it to do X, and then ask it to do Y, and then ask it to do Z, and it'll give you the most junior looking code ever. No real thought on abstractions, maybe you'll just get the logic split into different functions if you're lucky. But no big picture thinking, even if I prompt it well it'll then create bad abstractions that expose too much information.So eventually it gets to the point where I'm basically explaining to it what interfaces to abstract, what should be an implementation detail and what can be exposed to the wider system, what the method signatures should look like, etc.So I had a better experience when I just wrote the code myself at a very high level.

The types will have no fields, the functions will have no body, and they'll just have simple comments explaining what they should do. Then I ask the LLM to write the implementation of the types and functions.And to be fair, this is the approach I have taken for a very long time now. But when a new more powerful model is released, I will try and get it to solve these types of day to day problems from just prompts alone and it still isn't there yet.It's one of the biggest issues with LLM first software development from what I've seen. LLMs will happily just build upon bad foundations and getting them to \"think\" about refactoring the code to add a new feature takes a lot of prompting effort that most people just don't have. So they will stack change upon change upon change and sure, it works. But the code becomes absolutely unmaintainable.

I'll ask it to do X, and then ask it to do Y, and then ask it to do Z, and it'll give you the most junior looking code ever. No real thought on abstractions, maybe you'll just get the logic split into different functions if you're lucky. But no big picture thinking, even if I prompt it well it'll then create bad abstractions that expose too much information.So eventually it gets to the point where I'm basically expl人工智能ning to it what interfaces to abstract, what should be an implementation det人工智能l and what can be exposed to the wider system, what the method signatures should look like, etc.So I had a better experience when I just wrote the code myself at a very high level.

          "content": "I am pretty sure (though have not vetted) that triangulation of LoRa is possible even at very low SNR.The trick is understanding LoRa's trick, which is simply to \"skew\" the signal across time (via chirps), modulo a window of the configured bandwidth around the center frequency.  The key is that the skew rate is purely a function of the spreading factor, bandwidth, and IQ polarity (= pol × BW² / 2^SF), so there's a small-ish finite number of skew rates.  So you can just modulate raw IQ data with carriers at each of these skew rates to find one which gives you a bunch of carrier waves that hop around discretely at about twice the symbol rate, looking like an FSK signal.  You can then bin this at a factor of, say 2^(SF-2) to correlate the signal and raise it up above the noise floor, on which you can apply any standard triangulation technique.I'll try vetting this soon and reply to this post with results.",

I noticed that nearly all well known search engines, including the alternative ones, tend to be run by companies of various sizes with the goal to make money, so they either fill your results with ads or charge you money, and I dislike this because search is the backbone of the internet and should not be commercial, so it runs in a not-for-profit style and aims to survive on donations. Additionally I'm personally really sick of AI in my search results so I got rid of that, and I wanted DuckDuckGo bangs so it supports all of them. Like many alternative search engines, it is fully private.Sadly, it currently does not have its own index but rather uses the Brave search API. Once I'm in a financial position that it's possible, I would absolutely love to build a completely new index from the ground up which is open source, as well as an open source ranking and search algorithm, to back it.I posted on Reddit and got an amazing amount of feedback which I implemented a number of feature requests, so I would really like your ideas, critiques, and bug reports as well.

A Sputnik-era project funded by the National Science Foundation grant, the book is influential for its use of relativity in the presentation of the subject at the undergraduate level. In 1999, it was noted by Norman Foster Ramsey Jr. that the book was widely adopted and has many foreign translations.Something mysterious is going on here."

Many were looking for alternative ways to fund their podcasts like selling monthly subscriptions.I wonder if the ad market will start to drop out for other stuff like websites too.  AI might cannibalize search engine traffic... if google can basically scrape your site and then front-run you in the search results with an AI summary, you might not be able to make some money off the content you produce with online ads.  Some will say good riddance to the SEO spam type of websites that are stuffed with horrible ads, but there are also people making legitimately good or well intentioned content that live off ad spend.  I know I personally enjoy reading certain web comics that seem to be largely funded with online ads.  I certainly don't like ads, but sometimes I'd rather see something for free with an ad instead of paying for it.--On a different note, I sometimes use Instagram and recently I have seen a ton of ads for a local tech event... but the event already passed a good while ago, so every time I see the ad it's completely pointless.  Someone out there is getting screwed on their ad spend.

Many were looking for alternative ways to fund their podcasts like selling monthly subscriptions.I wonder if the ad market will start to drop out for other stuff like websites too.  人工智能 might cannibalize search engine traffic... if google can basically scrape your site and then front-run you in the search results with an 人工智能 summary, you might not be able to make some money off the content you produce with online ads.  Some will say good riddance to the SEO spam type of websites that are stuffed with horrible ads, but there are also people making legitimately good or well intentioned content that live off ad spend.  I know I personally enjoy reading cert人工智能n web comics that seem to be largely funded with online ads.  I cert人工智能nly don't like ads, but sometimes I'd rather see something for free with an ad instead of paying for it.--On a different note, I sometimes use Instagram and recently I have seen a ton of ads for a local tech event... but the event already passed a good while ago, so every time I see the ad it's completely pointless.  Someone out there is getting screwed on their ad spend.

          "content": "I have spent over $100k of my own money running ads on Meta, over $10k on Linkedin, and also significant amounts on Google (GDN/Youtube/keyword search) and X/Twitter.My experience:For most ad campaign types, YES, Meta works far better than any alternative.In my view, this is because its underlying machine-learning algorithms are better. Not the generative AI mentioned in the article, but the core ML-based learning strategy that every modern ad platform has been based on for over a decade now, allowing it to learn to find buyers for whatever you are selling. Meta is just better at that than anyone else - far better. And has been for years.Linkedin is quite interesting and can reach audiences no other ad platform can. The problem with LI is that it is tremendously expensive. Think $50-200 per qualified lead, so it only makes sense for very high ticket offers. I've never been able to make LI ads work for lowticket offers (i.e. under $500 gross margin per sale).I have attempted to run ads on X/twitter several times in the past 5 years, and each time gave up because of how terribly it performed. Literally zero sales from the ad spend, using the exact same ads which worked great on Meta. X is kind of infamous among media buyers for how bad it is. But I haven't tried it in over 8 months, so maybe it has gotten better now. Grok/xAI is quite good, so I am not sure why they haven't made the X ad platform a priority. If they did, I bet they could eat Meta's lunch.Google is really 3 ad platforms: Youtube, Google Display Network (GDN), and keyword search. These are all radically different in many dimensions; the only thing they have in common is that Google lets you set them all up through the same web interface.Mostly I run ads selling mid to high-ticket stuff to sophisticated buyers, and I think most of those people have Youtube Premium, which makes YT ad-free. So I haven't tried running ads on Youtube much. My media buyer colleagues who are into it are mostly selling mass-market offers that most people on HN would consider kind of scummy. They tell me it can work well, but requires a lot of ad spend over weeks to start working. In contrast, I can often get a Meta ad campaign profitable within 48 hours.Keyword search works great, but only for \"bottom of funnel\" buyers (i.e. people who are actively looking for a solution they can pay for right now). There are only so many of those, so generally you cannot scale up ad spend (and thus absolute profit) very high. In contrast, Meta can create new \"top of funnel\" buyers, which is a larger audience by many orders of magnitude, which allows you to ramp up some Meta campaigns to a very high level of profitable ad spend.GDN has been tricky for me. I think it has a lot of potential, but it has a very different model, and so far I have not been able to make it profitable for my offers. It certainly seems easier to set up a successful campaign with Meta.Short answer to your question: Yes, even with the things the article is justifiably griping about, Meta is just way, way better than any alternative right now.",

          "content_cn": "I have spent over $100k of my own money running ads on Meta, over $10k on Linkedin, and also significant amounts on Google (GDN/Youtube/keyword search) and X/Twitter.My experience:For most ad camp人工智能gn types, YES, Meta works far better than any alternative.In my view, this is because its underlying machine-learning algorithms are better. Not the generative 人工智能 mentioned in the article, but the core ML-based learning strategy that every modern ad platform has been based on for over a decade now, allowing it to learn to find buyers for whatever you are selling. Meta is just better at that than anyone else - far better. And has been for years.Linkedin is quite interesting and can reach audiences no other ad platform can. The problem with LI is that it is tremendously expensive. Think $50-200 per qualified lead, so it only makes sense for very high ticket offers. I've never been able to make LI ads work for lowticket offers (i.e. under $500 gross margin per sale).I have attempted to run ads on X/twitter several times in the past 5 years, and each time gave up because of how terribly it performed. Literally zero sales from the ad spend, using the exact same ads which worked great on Meta. X is kind of infamous among media buyers for how bad it is. But I haven't tried it in over 8 months, so maybe it has gotten better now. Grok/x人工智能 is quite good, so I am not sure why they haven't made the X ad platform a priority. If they did, I bet they could eat Meta's lunch.Google is really 3 ad platforms: Youtube, Google Display Network (GDN), and keyword search. These are all radically different in many dimensions; the only thing they have in common is that Google lets you set them all up through the same web interface.Mostly I run ads selling mid to high-ticket stuff to sophisticated buyers, and I think most of those people have Youtube Premium, which makes YT ad-free. So I haven't tried running ads on Youtube much. My media buyer colleagues who are into it are mostly selling mass-market offers that most people on HN would consider kind of scummy. They tell me it can work well, but requires a lot of ad spend over weeks to start working. In contrast, I can often get a Meta ad camp人工智能gn profitable within 48 hours.Keyword search works great, but only for \"bottom of funnel\" buyers (i.e. people who are actively looking for a solution they can pay for right now). There are only so many of those, so generally you cannot scale up ad spend (and thus absolute profit) very high. In contrast, Meta can create new \"top of funnel\" buyers, which is a larger audience by many orders of magnitude, which allows you to ramp up some Meta camp人工智能gns to a very high level of profitable ad spend.GDN has been tricky for me. I think it has a lot of potential, but it has a very different model, and so far I have not been able to make it profitable for my offers. It cert人工智能nly seems easier to set up a successful camp人工智能gn with Meta.Short answer to your question: Yes, even with the things the article is justifiably griping about, Meta is just way, way better than any alternative right now."

Meta has a lot of fingers in a lot of pies in terms of investors. Big companies like that helping out friendly investors is quite common.

Short of letting them fail, acquisitions with undisclosed amounts are a nice way out for investors and founders to liquidate their investments and save some face in the process.Meta gets some fresh talent and tech; investors get some return on investment and can claim some kind of exit happened. I doubt a lot of cash changed hands here. Share swaps are a common tool here.It will be interesting to see what Meta does with Manus. I don't expect they'll do a lot with it.
