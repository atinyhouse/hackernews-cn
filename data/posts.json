      "abstract": "该讨论围绕Spotify音乐备份项目展开，核心话题是数字媒体存档的重要性与可行性。多数用户肯定此类存档对防止文化内容丢失的价值，尤其关注小众或已下架歌曲的保存。\n\n社区共识认为，在流媒体平台内容可能随时消失的当下，主动存档具有文化保护意义。有用户指出，项目虽对普通用户不便，但能有效应对“灰色曲目”问题；也有人强调应优先保存科学文献等更易流失的数据。\n\n主要分歧在于存档内容的优先级与实用性。有人认为大规模音乐备份对普通听众意义有限，因Spotify本身已足够便捷；另有观点反驳称已有工具可解决海量文件检索问题。同时，部分用户主张需区分存档价值，不必盲目保存所有内容，而应聚焦历史资料或濒危内容。讨论中还提及，当前是应对未来AI生成内容泛滥前进行存档的关键窗口期。",

The only thing is, you can't really publicly admit exactly what dataset you trained/tested on...?Definitely wondering if this was in response to desire from AI researchers/companies who wanted this stuff.

I understand the legal arguments for this, but from a spiritual perspective, this is one of the most offensive things I can imagine.

I like the fact that I can download 100 MiB ultra-high resolution TIFF files of scans of photographs from the original negative from the Library of Congress and 24-bit/96kHz FLAC files of captures of 78 RPM records from the Internet Archive. In addition to maintaining completeness and quality of information, one of the main goals of preservation is to guard against further degradation and information loss. You should try to preserve the highest quality copies available (because they contain more information) and re-encoding (deliberate degradation) should only be used to create convenient access copies.Inferior copies, in addition to being less informative, have the potential to misinform. Only the archivist will enjoy space savings. All the readers who might consult your library in the infinite future will bear the cost.> ...(e.g. lossless FLAC). This inflates the file size...This is entirely the wrong view. The file size of a raw capture compressed to FLAC should be thought of as the “true” or “correct” size. It is roughly the most efficient (balancing various trade-offs) representation of sampled audio data that we can presently achieve. In preservation we seek to preserve the item or signal itself and not simply what we might perceive thereof. This human-centric perception view is just wrong. There is data in film photographs which cannot be perceived visually yet can be of interest to researchers and be revealed with digital image analysis tools.As an example of how much information celluloid can contain see: https://vimeo.com/89784677\n(context: he is comparing a Blu-ray and a scan of a 35mm print)",

While alcohol had a very clear and statistically-significant influence on the risk of a driver causing an accident, THC did not.To steelman the idea that THC causes accidents, [0] only looks at habitual users with baseline levels of THC and [1] only looks at non-fatal injuries.My conclusion right now is that the number of drivers in accidents with THC in their blood is going up because the number of people with THC in their blood is going up, not because drivers who use THC cause accidents.The law's assumption that this level of THC is evidence of impairment seems to be invalid.The law would be better off measuring impairment in some way and perhaps intensifying penalties when an impairment test fails and the user has THC concentration above some threshold.[0]: https://academic.oup.com/clinchem/article/71/12/1225/8299832...[1]: https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31106494/",

I think it’s becoming more socially acceptable to acknowledge that marijuana causes impairment even after the obvious effects have subsided, which was a taboo topic in the years when saying anything negative about marijuana would get you attacked as being pro-prohibition or pro-imprisonment of drug users. I even remember one of the big technical forums in the 2010s had a long debate thread where people were claiming that THC made them better drivers and citing YouTube videos and “studies” to back it up.

That's an absolutely massive risk factor, the kind you would expect to show up very, very clearly in any kind of statistical analysis of car crashes.But the other thing I've seen a bunch of people cite in this discussion is that there has been no statistically significant increase in fatal crashes following marijuana legalization.That would imply that either there was no statistically significant increase in drivers high on marijuana since legalization, or there was no statistically significant increase in the likelihood of causing a fatal crash from being high on marijuana.Based on our knowledge of human nature, the former seems incredibly unlikely (yes, there would surely be some people who would have been smoking pot before who just stopped hiding it as much, but there would also, just as surely, be many people who had been interested in getting high before, but who had been intimidated by its legal status or had no idea how to find a dealer until there were dispensaries opening in every town).The latter directly contradicts the implication of this study—but this is only one study, and may have methodological issues that we are unaware of.",

NYC cops decided to “strike on the job” when the city started changing its stance in the mid-2010s, and in the Bay the cops responded similarly to Prop 47 by effectively not prosecuting shoplifting and other minor crimes anymore. Similarly, the recall of Pamela Price started almost the moment she took office and was accompanied by a work slowdown by the OPD in the interest of making the crime situation look worse. There’s other examples, but effectively the police have turned lax enforcement into a tool to preclude any shifts in policing policies. I’ve got my own feelings about those policies, but when you’ve got the cops acting like a political block that gets to set policies instead of a group of city employees tasked with enforcing them, I think that should concern the rest of us.",

Directors often don’t write the script. They don’t handle the camera or the lighting or sound. They don’t create the music. They don’t do the editing in post. They don’t do the acting. But they do direct all of the people doing those things to achieve an overall vision, and we recognize that has significant artistic merit. Directors are not artists, or cinematographers, or composers, or actors, or visual effects artists, or sound technicians. But they are still artists, because art is more than the technical skill to produce something.",

And they of course sound like writing (books and periodicals etc) rather than \"chat\": as other responders allude to, the fine-tuning or RL process for making them good at conversation was presumably quite different from what is used for most chatbots, and they're leaning very heavily into the pre-training texts. We don't have any living Victorians to RLHF on: we just have what they wrote.To go a little deeper on the idea of 19th-century \"chat\": I did a PhD on this period and yet I would be hard-pushed to tell you what actual 19th-century conversations were like. There are plenty of literary depictions of conversation from the 19th century of presumably varying levels of accuracy, but we don't really have great direct historical sources of everyday human conversations until sound recording technology got good in the 20th century. Even good 19th-century transcripts of actual human speech tend to be from formal things like court testimony or parliamentary speeches, not everyday interactions. The vast majority of human communication in the premodern past was the spoken word, and it's almost all invisible in the historical sources.Anyway, this is a really interesting project, and I'm looking forward to trying the models out myself!",

By the time Windows 95 came out around 10% of US users had internet access.It wasn't until 2001 that the US reached 50% of users having internet access.Without internet there wasn't really a good way to distribute updates to most users.As a developer in that era working at a company that made software for PCs and Macs it was great. It meant that the way most users would get our software was buying it on floppy disk (or later CD) from a retail software store like CompUSA or Egghead.We'd only make more money from someone who bought our software if that software made a good enough impression that they bought more of our software. We'd lose money if any software went out with enough bugs or a confusing enough interface or a poorly enough written manual that a lot of people made a lot of calls to our toll free tech support.This was great because it largely aligned what developers wanted to do (write a feature complete program with a great UI and no bugs) and what management wanted (happy users who do not call tech support).With internet giving us the ability to push updates at almost zero cost and as often as we want people who release incomplete programs early and add the missing parts in updates are going to outcompete people who don't release until the program is complete and nearly bug free.Once you get there it is not much of a leap to decide that what you are really selling is not software to do X but rather the service of providing software to do X.

But I bought in when the first stories hit of the DDR5 price rises - at that time there had 'only' been a doubling, now the price is a further 3x of what I paid a good month ago. I thought it might be a good time to buy given the machine was so old and component prices were going up, and might for a long time.\nBut yeah, performance improvements aren't what they used to. Part of the reason is that normal things were  already felt so fast on the old one ;-) But I did get a much better gfx cards allowing some games that were unplayable before, and I think the CPU upgrade was needed for that as well, and then you might as well overhaul the machine.

Throw in the fact that copy-on-write and snapshotting is baked into most storage today and it becomes - at least compared to 20 years ago - trivial to set up DRS as well.  Others have mentioned pgBackRest and that further enforces the ease with which you can set up these traditionally-complex setups.Beyond those two significant features there isn't many other reasons you'd need to go with hosted/managed pgsql.  I've yet to find a managed/hosted database solution that doesn't have some level of downtime to apply updates and patches so even if you go fully hosted/managed it's not a silver bullet.  The cost of managed DB is also several times that of the actual hardware it's running on, so there is a cost factor involved as well.I guess all this to say it's never been a better time to self-host your database and the learning curve is as shallow as it's ever been.

The situation is even worse for major database upgrades: stop the application, upgrade the database, deploy a new release of the app because some features are not compatible between versions, test, re-analyze the tables, reopen the database, and only then can users resume work.Everything in SQL/RDBMS was thought for a single-node instance, not including replicas. It's not HA because there can be only one read-write instance at a time. They even claim to be more ACID than MongoDB, but the ACID properties are guaranteed only on a single node.One exception is Oracle RAC, but PostgreSQL has nothing like that. Some forks, like YugabyteDB, provide real HA with most PostgreSQL features.About the hype: many applications that run on PostgreSQL accept hours of downtime, planned or unplanned.

Black box debugging is one of the most time costuming engineering pursuits, & even when it's something widely documented & well supported like RDS, it's only really tuned for the lowest common denominator - the complexities of tuning someone else's system at scale can really add up to only marginally less effort than self-hosting (if there's any difference at all).But most importantly - even if it's significantly less effort than self-hosting, it's never effectively costed when evaluating trade-offs - that's what leads to this persistent myth about the engineering cost of self-hosting. \"Managing\" managed services is a non-zero cost.Add to that the ultimate trade-off of accountability vs availability (internal engineers care less about availability when it's out of there hands - but it's still a loss to your product either way).",

I tried to explore some other solutions, but found out the lack of a high level design really makes the HA for PostgreSQL really hard if not impossible. For example, without the necessary information in WAL, it's hard to enforce primary node even with an external Raft/Paxos coordinator. I wrote some of them down in this blog (https://www.binwang.me/2025-08-13-Why-Consensus-Shortcuts-Fa...) especially in the section \"Highly Available PostgreSQL Cluster\" and \"Quorum\".My theory of why Postgres is still getting the hype is either people don't know the problem, or it's acceptable on some level. I've worked in a team that maintains the in house database cluster (even though we were using MySQL instead of PostgreSQL) and the HA story was pretty bad.

I believe that for software engineers it's really easy to see if it's being useful or not -- We can just run the code and see if the output is what we expected, if not, iterate it, and continue.

I thought generally, the criticism of LLMs was that while they do abstract from their corpus - ie, you can regard them as having a representation of \"meaning\" - it's tightly and inextricably tied to the surface level representation, it isn't grounded in models of the external world, and LLMs have poor ability to transfer that knowledge to other surface encodings.I don't know who the \"certain AI researchers\" are supposed to be. But the \"stochastic parrot\" paper by Bender et al [1] says:> Text generated by an LM is not grounded in communicative intent, any model of the world, or any model of the reader’s state of mind.That's a very different objection to the one antirez describes - I think he's erecting a straw man.

Last year I was very optimistic that LLMs would entirely change how we write software by making use of them as a fundamental part of our programming tool kit (in a similar way that ML fundamentally changed the options available to programmers for solving problems). Instead we've just come up with more expensive ways to extend the chat metaphor (the current generation of \"agents\" is disappointingly far from the original intent of agents in AI/CS).The thing I am increasingly confused about is why so many people continue to need LLMs to be more than they obviously are. I get why crypto boosters exist, if I have 100 BTC, I have a very clear interest getting others to believe that they are valuable. But with \"AI\", I don't quite get, for the non-VS/founder, why it matters that people start foaming out the mouth over AI rather than just using it for the things it's good at.Though I have some growing sense that this need is related to another trend I've personally started with witness: AI psychosis is very real. I personally know an increasing number of people who are spiraling into an LLM induced hallucinated world. The most shocking was someone talking about how losing human relationships is inevitable because most people can't keep up with those enhanced by AI acceleration.

The stochastic parrot does not understand the query nor is trying to reply to you in any way, it just exploits a probabilistic link among the context window and the next word. This link can be more complex than a Markov chain but must be of the same kind: lacking understanding whatsoever and communication intent (no representation of the concept / sentences that are required to reply correctly).

Everyone forgets that losing money is an expected operating mode for a high growth startup. The models and hardware continue to improve. There is so much investment money accelerating this process that we have plenty of runway to continue improving before companies have to switch to full profit focus mode.But even if we ignore that fact and assume they had to switch to profit mode tomorrow, LLM plans are currently so cheap that even a doubling or tripling isn’t going to be a problem. So what if the monthly plans start at $40 instead of $20 and the high usage plans go from $200 to $400 or even $600? The people using these for their jobs paying $10K or more per month can absorb that.That’s not going to happen, though. If all model progress stopped right now the companies would still be capturing cheaper compute as data center buildouts were completed and next generation compute hardware was released.I see these predictions as the current equivalent of all of the predictions that Uber was going to collapse when the VC money ran out.

If \"good enough\" is now cheaper to implement that's all they will do. I've seen it in other technologies. As an example due to more precise manufacturing many manufacturers have used it to cheapen things like cars, electronics, etc just to the point where it passes warranty mostly; in the old days they had to \"overbuild\" to get it to that point putting more quality into the product.Quality is a risk mitigation strategy; if software is disposable just like cheap manufactured goods most people won't pay for it thinking they can just \"build another one\". What we don't realise is due to sheer cost of building software we've wanted quality because its too expensive to fix later; AI could change that.Hoping we invest in quality, more software (which has a price inelastic curve mostly due to scale/high ROI) etc I'm starting to think is just false hope from people in the tech industry that want to be optimistic which generally is in our nature. Tech people understand very little about economics most of the time and how people outside tech (your customers) generally operate.

      "abstract": "该讨论围绕2023年一篇题为“我体验了一周无IPv4网络”的帖子展开，核心话题是IPv6的实际部署现状、技术优势及面临的挑战。社区中许多用户指出，IPv6在美国主要运营商中已普遍启用且运行稳定，例如T-Mobile甚至提供纯IPv6移动网络服务，证明其技术已成熟。但也有用户批评原文缺乏具体体验细节，认为其结论过于乐观。\n\n讨论中明显存在分歧：一方认为IPv6能解决NAT穿透等问题，并提到中国在“十四五”规划中大力推进IPv6，移动用户使用率已达70%；另一方则指出实际部署仍不完善，如部分运营商未启用、防火墙配置复杂可能导致安全风险，且有企业因安全政策禁用IPv6，影响开发调试。共识在于，多数用户认同IPv6是必然趋势，但推广受阻于基础设施滞后、管理误区及兼容性顾虑。",

If you really wanted it to your router could do the same thing for IPv6.IPv6 also has local addresses, but a lot more of them. Anything starting with fd00::/8 is a local address with 40 bits available as the network number. So you can set up your local network with the prefix fdXX:XXXX:XXXX::/48 (where the Xs are chosen randomly) as the prefix and still have 16 bits left over for different subnets if you want. These addresses do not change when your ISP changes your public prefix.And if you want to add reverse dns for SLAAC addresses then just have your router listen for ICMPv6 Neighbor Announcement addresses and use them to update your DNS server as appropriate. Or configure your servers to use stable addresses based on their MAC address rather than random addresses (which are better for privacy), and then just configure the DNS as you add and remove servers.",

It seemed that the \"light is out means 4-way stop\" dynamic caused them to go into ultra-timid mode. And of course the human drivers did the typical slow and roll, with decent interleaving.The result was that each Waymo took about 4x as long to get through the intersections. I saw one Waymo get bluffed out of its driving slot by cross traffic for perhaps 8 slots.This was coupled with the fact that the Waymos seemed to all be following the same route. I saw a line of about a dozen trying to turn left, which is the trickiest thing to navigate.And of course I saw one driver get pissed off and drive around a Waymo that was advancing slowly, with the predictable result that the Waymo stopped and lost three more slots through the intersection.On normal days, Waymos are much better at the 4-way stops than they used to be a few years back, by which I mean they are no longer dangerously timid. The Zoox (Amazon) cars are more like the Waymos used to be.I expect there will be some software tweaks that will improve this situation, both routing around self-induced congestion and reading and crossing streets with dead lights.Note that I didn't see any actually dead Waymos as others have reported here.

Evidently, a power outage is the reason I don't see the traffic light lit up. Also other drivers are going through the intersection one by one, as if they think the light is not working.\"It's not enough to just analyze the camera data and see neither green nor yellow nor red. Other things can cause that, like a burned out bulb, a sensor hardware problem, a visual obstruction (bird on a utility cable), or one of those louvers that makes the traffic light visible only from certain specific angles.Since the rules are different depending on whether the light is functioning or not, you really need to know the answer, but it seems hard to be confident.

The local municipality rounds up enough stop signs to plant in the middle of the intersections that people seem to actually be learning what to do (as unlikely as that sounds).By day 2 or 3, it's still somewhat chaotic -- but it seems \"safe\" in that the majority of the people understand what to do (it's just stop sign -- it may be a stop sign at an amazingly-complex intersection, but it's still just a stop sign) and the flyers are infrequent-enough to look out for.By day 5 or 6, traffic flows more-or-less fine and it feels like the traffic lights were never necessary to begin with.

Which makes sense because in many parts of the world where there are no traffic lights or stop signs, people get on just fine.The Waymo’s, on the other hand, were dropping like flies.

Both for the victims and for their offenders?Or is it just a show where everyone can see them as detective/judge?Just to add a bit more context: after years of trials, one of our former President finally went to jail for a few weeks.\nAnd now, they're invited by media all over the country so they can complain about how unfair it was, they published a book about it, sold in the tens of thousands, their son is the new TV's favorite...So I'm wondering: is it actual justice at work, or just a distraction while nothing change and nobody is actually held accountable?",

So just the praise for cloning so quickly makes me sort of mad.You could theoretically make something like this that allowed log in so you got a personalized epstein mails, and then could do all that, and perhaps get more mails sent in as files get released, and perhaps create Google alerts on epstein in the news etc. that would come as mails and maybe the code could put news that came in, into the appropriate the tags etc.But until that time \"cloned\" is just very wrong.",

          "content": "> When implementing logging, it's important to distinguish between an error from the perspective of an individual operation and an error from the perspective of the overall program or system. Individual operations may well experience errors that are not error level log events for the overall program. You could say that an operation error is anything that prevents an operation from completing successfully, while a program level error is something that prevents the program as a whole from working right.This is a nontrivial problem when using properly modularized code and libraries that perform logging. They can’t tell whether their operational error is also a program-level error, which can depend on usage context, but they still want to log the operational error themselves, in order to provide the details that aren’t accessible to higher-level code. This lower-level logging has to choose some status.Should only “top-level” code ever log an error?  That can make it difficult to identify the low-level root causes of a top-level failure. It also can hamper modularization, because it means you can’t repackage one program’s high-level code as a library for use by other programs, without somehow factoring out the logging code again.",

The important thing is what your program logs should be documented somewhere, the next most important thing is that your log levels are self consistent and follow some sort of logic, and that I would have done it exactly the same is not really important.At the end of the day, this is just bikeshedding about how to collapse ultra specific alerting levels into a few generic ones. E.g.

Making donating super easy would I reckon greatly increase the income for all those on the receiving end.However I can't see it happening, governments would outlaw it claiming it'd be used to transfer money for nefarious purposes, money laundering etc.The major reason I don't donate to good/charitable causes is that I cannot do so anonymously.Shame really.",

Target does significant amounts of data collection to track their customers. This is a choice. They could let users simply buy things, pay for them, and store nothing. This used to be the business model. For online orders, they could purge everything after the return window passed. The order data shouldn’t be needed after that. For brick and mortar, it should be a very straightforward business. However, I’m routinely asked for my zip code or phone number when I check out at stores. Loyalty cards are also a way to incentivize customers to give up this data (https://xkcd.com/2006/).TVs are another big one. They are all “smart” now, and collect significant amounts of data. I don’t know anyone who would be upset with a simple screen that just let you change inputs and brightness settings, and let people plug stuff into it. Nothing needs to be collected or phone home.A lot of the logs that are collected in the name of troubleshooting and bug fixing exist because the products are over-complicated or not thoroughly tested before release. The ability to update things later lowers the bar for release and gives a pass for adding all this complexity that users don’t really want. There is a lot of complexity in the smart TV that they might want logs for, but none of it improves the user experience, it’s all in support of the real business model that’s hidden from the user.",

They make it easier and therefore possible to do so. I'd describe it as the crane that lifts up the heavy weight enough for you to shuffle out.If you can just think harder about your problems, by all means, do that.

          "content": "As someone medicated I actually fully agree with you.Depression is also a broad spectrum condition (much like autism). Years ago I watched this lecture by Sapolsky[0] and it really helped. Breaking down the different classifications is really helpful. The SSRIs always made me feel worse, and this (along with a lot of other research) helped make sense of it. A few years back I was diagnosed with ADHD and a psychologist friend encouraged me to give Adderall a try. It was the first time that medication \"worked\" and it really made a big difference in my life. The big reason why being that psychomotor retardation and anhedonia were my biggest symptoms. When coupled with an anxiety disorder it creates a strong negative feedback loop.But here's the thing: medication isn't the cure. For me it alleviates (not eliminates) symptoms but at the end of the day it still requires work from me to ensure I create a positive feedback loop and don't let myself fall into that destructive loop. This is all stuff I had to learn on my own and through reading and seeking out friends with people who are more experts in the area. That's where I think our care system fails.The best thing I can recommend to people is to be introspective. Each journey is personal, but whatever your issues are try to find the early warning signs. For me it can be little things like the dishes piling up or my desk getting messy (these seem you be common). Things like depression build up, so look for the signs. And most importantly, open up. This was the hardest for me and makes me feel demasculated and embarrassed much of the time. But I've also found it to help build stronger relationships with my partner and friends. That it helps open a door to communicate both ways. Maybe you open the door for you, but you also open a door many are too nervous to open themselves. It's worth the discomfort and gets easier with time. (Talking behind a handle is a great way to start too. So make alt accounts if you need to.

So no fees for authors and if libraries put their money where their mouth is then also full OA and thus no barriers to reading. All journals full OA since 2024. Easy.",

From their info page [0], \"premium\" features include:  * Access to the ACM Guide to Computing Machinery\n  * AI-generated article summaries\n  * Podcast-style summaries of conference sessions\n  * Advanced search\n  * Rich article metadata, including download metrics, index terms and citations received\n  * Bulk citation exports and PDF downloads\n\nThe AI-generated article summaries has been getting a lot of discussion in my social circles. They have apparently fed many (all?) papers into some LLM to generate summaries... which is absurd when you consider that  practically every article has an abstract as part of its text and submission. These abstract were written by the authors and have been reviewed more than almost any other part of the articles, so they are very unlikely to contain errors. In contrast, multiple of my colleagues have found errors of varying scales in the AI-generated summaries of their own papers — many of which are actually longer than the existing abstracts.In addition, there are apparently AI-generated summaries for articles that were licensed with a non-derivative-works clause, which means the ACM has breached not just the social expectations of using accurate information, but also the legal expectations placed upon them as publishers of these materials.I think it's interesting that the ACM is positioning these \"premium\" features as a necessity due to the move to open-access publishing [1], especially when multiple other top-level comments on this post are discussing how open-access can often be more profitable than closed-access publishing.[0] https://dl.acm.org/premium[1] The Digital Library homepage (https://dl.acm.org/) features a banner right now that says: \"ACM is now Open Access.

      "abstract": "该讨论围绕OpenSCAD这一编程式3D建模工具展开。核心话题是评估其优缺点，并探讨替代方案。许多用户赞赏OpenSCAD的简洁性和对程序员友好，认为其基于代码的范式特别适合生成重复性几何结构（如齿轮），且学习曲线相对平缓。有人认为它让涉及基本几何体变换的建模变得直观。\n\n然而，社区也指出了其显著局限和引发的争议。主要分歧在于是否应转向其他工具。有用户认为OpenSCAD缺乏面向对象特性（如直接访问box1.width）、尺寸标注支持不足，且建模能力受限于个人的数学抽象能力，这促使他们寻找替代品。讨论中提到了多种基于Python的替代方案，如CadQuery、Build123d和新兴的Zoo/KCL，这些工具旨在提供更完整的编程语言功能、双向编辑能力或更好的参数化设计。\n\n共识在于，OpenSCAD是程序员入门3D建模的一个出色起点，尤其适合参数化、程序化生成模型。但对于需要复杂交互、详细工程图纸或更丰富编程范式的用户，可能需要转向功能更全面的工具。",

I'm very much a beginner in the CAD space and would love to understand what inspired you to build sdf.My basic understanding is that STL files are essentially like Bitmap images and store a list of triangles and their positions, whereas STEP files are more like Vector art where there is a list of instructions on how to build the model. Most CAD GUI programs also operate on a similar model to vector art where they record a list of operations one on top of another. It's why STEP files are a standardized format and can be imported / exported from most GUI based CAD builders. I think.Given that SDF also seems like it builds only STL files (I could be wrong), wouldn't learning build123d or CadQuery work better if one cares about compatibility with existing GUI based CAD modeling software?Additionally, atleast build123d offers a similar conceptual model to using Fusion360 and FreeCad - I have limited experience here - but essentially you sketch something in 2D on a particular plane, and then apply some operations to convert it to 3d in a particular manner - the simplest being extruding. This means the mental modeling of how to construct something is very similar across both GUI based CAD programs and Build123d, and that makes it easier for me to jump between GUI based and code based CAD modelling.I'd love to understand your point of view, and learn more.[0] - https://github.com/gumyr/build123d[1] - https://github.com/CadQuery/cadquery",

While most CAD tools have a million features to learn, OpenSCAD is completely described by a cheat sheet you could print on a piece of A4 (like most programming languages).I would really recommend using the git master than the latest release though. The last release was 2021 but they are still actively working on it and it's much faster now.I also have to recommend the BOSL2 library which means you don't have to implement all of those one million features from typical CAD software yourself. Its definitely got a bit of a learning curve but the fact that you can always default back to vanilla OpenSCAD and that you can actually see how stuff is implemented makes it much more satisfying to me to learn than learning what all the traditional CAD GUI buttons do.",

Render times drop from minutes to seconds for complex models. The official 2021 release is painfully outdated.Also, the BOSL2 library is essential - it adds proper filleting, rounding, and attachment operations that vanilla OpenSCAD lacks.

I've been 3D printing for a while, but I never really got to a place where I could design interesting parts until I started to get the precision of doing models in code. Sometimes it is slower, for sure.Every time I've used as a CAD GUI program I would get to this point where I would need to alter a single dimension by 0.25mm and realize that _all_ of my fastener holes, cutouts, etc have to be nudged with the keyboard or mouse to accommodate it. The input devices lack precision for that kind of task, and having to repeat the operation dozens of times (or bulk select) gave me a terrible sinking feeling, and I'd often just step away and give up on the design at that point out of frustration. I try to approach everything in OpensSCAD in a way that means I never have to experience that feeling again.I will also say that doing everything from scratch in OpenSCAD would be it's own special kind of hell. Libraries like [BOSL2](https://github.com/BelfrySCAD/BOSL2) provide a good set of core ideas and preferences that help set you on a good path. A good example: BOSL2 shapes tend to have a \"center origin\" by default, which is different than the OpenSCAD default, but makes doing transforms later way easier.Anyway, happy to see OpenSCAD getting some attention here :)",

          "content": "Not just that but it also positions everything in absolute coordinates and does not have the ability to reason about solids, just surfaces. Basically if you want to model something like a bolt you need to create a cylinder for the shaft, a separate head of the bolt, and then a thread profile you can rotate around the cylinder. You must ensure there is enough overlap between these three separate parts so the resultant object is a single surface and not three separate ones.You can use modules to create a semblance of relative measurements but you still cannot do things like “attach this surface of object A to that surface of object B)”. In practice this means that if you want to create something like a spacer or a bracket you can do that easily enough. But if you want to make a part that matches some real world design you are stuck doing a lot of caliper measurements and math to try to create a part that lines up correctly. The you 3D print it and find that you positioned some hole based on its edge and not center and so nothing quite fits.OpenSCAD is easy to start but difficult to scale because of these limitations and because once you hard-code any measurement you are stuck with it. The “proper” way to do this is to give everything a variable but honestly that makes reasoning about how to line things up even more difficult. “Does base_width include the width of the vertical walls? What about the margin to make the parts fit together?”I have never been able to understand how things like FreeCAD lay out their UI. TinkerCAD is relatively simple but clearly a lot less powerful. I did try cadquery which solved a lot of OpenSCAD’s issues by having all offsets be relative by default but also introduces a few issues of its own.One tip I will give about OS: grab a copy of the latest beta/dev release.

Unless it's dead simple I'm usually thinking why the hell did I multiply this thingy by sqrt(3)/2 plus this other thing.

To quote:> In the example above, the second cube sits exactly on top of the first cube. This is something that should be avoided, as it’s not clear to OpenSCAD whether the two cubes form one object together. This issue can be easily solved by always maintaining a small overlap of about 0.001 - 0.002 between the corresponding objects. One way to do so is by decreasing the amount of translation along the Z axis from 10 unit to 9.999 units.This struck me when making the example in my post. In line 47 I specifically add 1 to heightCompartment to ensure the opening extends past the top of the main body. If I didn't do that, this happens during preview: https://imgur.com/a/Amc1dK6 (That's an exported image from the latest nightly of OpenSCAD.)But it doesn't happen during the actual render?Still, that just feels... like there's something going on with a floating point value or something which, programatically, is probably correct... But from the perspective of someone trying to design something feels Very Wrong. Because I have a 20mm high box, I subtract a 19mm high box from it, starting 1mm up from the base. Why shouldn't the top be open? Why is it acceptable for it to be maybe kinda open but broken by design?",

Then comes the second phase of exploitation, where we actually use the thing we learned. You can think of all those “learning from scratch” videos as someone who is doing the phase 2.  I love the phase one and most of the time don’t have time and energy to sit down and go through the phase 2. Nowadays, I feel like the 2 phases are combined, thanks to LLMs. For instance, I wanted to do some animation for visualizations. This week, I learned AnimeJS by watching CCAgent create the animation I wanted, which was interspersed with questions that were answered with diagrams and text, which accomplishes the phase 1. I do not like letting them run the show. Then comes phase 2, where I organize the code, abstract things, rewrite code, still use their  help for long rewrites, but totally my ideas and mine only.

I would say the ratio of truly internalized knowledge is much higher for failure.The notion that you can get a bot to just vomit out a vector database and then you can just \"read the code\" and you'll understand how a vector database works is just ludicrous.",

It’s doing the messy work of (a) making design choices, (b) getting stuck, (c) debugging, and (d) forming the mental model that lets you reproduce it later. Reviewing a correct implementation can create a feeling of “I get it,” but that feeling often doesn’t survive a blank file.I’ve noticed this in my own hobby coding: LLMs are great for familiarity and unblocking progress, but the learning “sticks” much more when I’ve had to struggle through the failure modes myself. I’m watching the same dynamic play out with my son using ChatGPT to study for physics/calculus . . . it feels deep for him in the moment with the LLM, but exam-style transfer exposes the gaps.",

          "content": "I sort of disagree. It's somewhat like having hypercard again. You can build fun UI things and make machines do what you want them to do. You can care about the parts you want to care about and not sweat about the parts you don't want to learn in detail (yet). And Claude and codex make great guides/Sherpas.There are just too many parts involved to do anything. For example today I built a simple data collection app to use on my phone that involves inventories with photos for a tedious workflow I have to do. I knew what I wanted but didn't know how to even choose which tools to bother learn. And just even trying things to see if an approach works or not without spending hours learning one thing or another or wading through the hell of web search is really great.Things I learned today that I figure everyone else must know: if you want to take a photo from a webapp I guess you need https. So I decided to try mTLS (knew it existed but never had the time) so asked Claude to write me a short tutorial about setting it up, creating keys, importing them (including a cool single line trick of spinning up a python server and downloading the keys on my phone rather than find a USB stick or whatever). And then helping me figure out a path out of the suffering of Chrome and Firefox hating self-signed CA. But at least I figured out how to make Firefox happy. But it would insist on prompting me for the certificate for every htmx request. But chatting with Claude I learn caddy is pretty cool, it's go. Claude suggests an auth boxcar when I balk at adding auth and user management to my app because I think the webserver should handle all this shit (wtf is a boxcar? Claude clues me in). I tell Claude to use go or rust to build the boxcar because Jesus Christ \"yay\" build another service just to get a good damn customized CRUD app on my phone that can take a picture. Claude picks go which is fine by me. (Incidentally I can't write go, but I can read it and it's on my \"to be learned\" agenda and go seems safer than a pile of python for this simple thing) The boxcar was fine but Claude was struggling with getting headers to work in the caddy config. So while Claude is working on that I do a quick Google about whether caddy can have extensions because there has to be a better way to \"if someone has authenticated successfully, give them a cookie that will last an hour so they don't have to mash the confirm about using the certificate for every goddamn htmx request\" than spin up a web service. Interrupt Claude and suggest an extension instead of a boxcar. Claude's on board so we ditch the boxcar. Have Claude and codex evaluate the extension for security. They find important issues about things a jerk might do, fix them. So successful mTLS connections transition to session cookies. So my dumb CRUD tool doesn't have to worry about auth. Which it didn't have to do anyway except browsers say so etc because my phone is literally only able to access the server via VPN anyway.Other things I have learned today that only wasted 5min of Claude's time rather than hours of mine: Firefox camera access can't control flash, focus or zoom. So call out to the native app instead.This is all quite fun and the tool I'm building is going to really make my own life better.Is there a better way to do this: probably.",

          "content": "Think of it like this: overhead power lines require you to dig a 5-7’ deep hole that’s 2’ in diameter every 90’.\nUnderground power supplied through cable requires you to bury the cable minimum 3’ in the ground in rigid ductwork the entire 90’. Any time that cable runs under a roadway that ductwork needs to be encased in concrete. In urban and semi urban areas you also compete with other buried infrastructure for space - sewer, city/municipal infrastructure, gas, electrical transmission, etc.While underground distribution systems are less prone to interruption from bad weather it depends on the circuit design. If the underground portion of the circuit is fed from overhead power lines coming from the distribution substation you will still experience interruptions from faults on the overhead. These faults can also occur on overhead transmission circuits (the lines feeding the distribution substations and/or very large industrial customers).Underground distribution comes at a cost premium compared to overhead distribution. It’s akin to the cost of building a picket fence vs installing a geothermal heating system for your home. This is why new sub divisions will commonly have underground cable installed as the entire neighborhood is being constructed - there’s no need to retrofit underground cable into an existing area and so the costs are lower and borne upfront.It’s more cost effective for them to turn the power off as a storm rolls through, patrol, make repairs and reenergize then to move everything underground. Lost revenue during that period is a small fraction of the cost of taking an existing grid and rebuilding it underground. This is especially true for transmission circuits that are strung between steel towers over enormous distances.",

They were shocked that I wanted to use level 1, apparently no one uses it. They also suggested starting at 5 mins instead of the 1-2 minutes I wanted to do. The machine itself has a notice saying not to go over 3 mins for the first week.I was following the protocol from this paper, which started people at 2 mins and used low wattage UVB-heavy bulbs.Sunbeds with UVB radiation can produce physiological levels of serum 25-Hydroxyvitamin D in healthy volunteershttps://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5821157/Unfortunately the Science Advances paper being discussed is epidemiological and doesn't distinguish between the type of bulb, length of time, and other parameters used while tanning. However it is safe to say that the average tanner cares more about getting dark than anything else.I think there would actually be a market for vitamin D centered \"healthy tanning\" where only low wattage, high-UVB bulbs are used particularly in cloudy areas or where the winter is long. I'm that guessing the operating costs for that kind of business would be cheaper than your average tanning salon, too.",

It increased the risk of developing MM, and the risk of dying from MM, although all-cause mortality was not increased even in patients diagnosed with MM. (This seems to be because there is a very low overall risk of MM mortality, but UV light exposure seems to provide a greater overall health benefit than the small risk of increased MM risk).",

Since she was a fashion icon, this made the tanned look fashionable.As an aside, the chemistry behind UV damage is interesting. You can think of DNA as a sequence of four letters: C, G, A, and T. If there are two neighboring T's, UV can move a bond, linking the two T's together (i.e. thymine dimerization). If you're in the sun, each skin cell gets 50-100 of these pairs created per second. Enzymes usually fix these errors, but sometimes the errors will cause problems during DNA replication and you can end up with mutations. Enough of the wrong mutations can cause skin cancer.

Also, I think it is a dynamic process, so even cells the immune system hasn't killed yet could be found later. Or the mutation could cause other deviancies that will make the cell uncompetitive with healthy cells. But it is a slow process - it takes years for former smokers' lung cancer risk to return to near that of never smokers. And it probably never gets there - some mutated cells may never be detectable and there's clearly also a threshold beyond which the cancer is irreversible, at least without intervention."

If you only tan in a strong tanning bed for 10 min (or 15 min in a weaker one), it's equivalent to only about an hour in the real sun around noon. I.e. if you've only been going to a tanning bed, you'll start to burn outdoors shortly after that. (And I'm talking about high-UVB bulbs that develop the long-lasting tan that protects against sunburn, just like the sun itself generates.)So the difference factor is more like 4-6x, not 10-15x. Honestly, 15x would be insane. Tanning beds aren't as strong as some fearmongerers suggest. And that's assuming full-body exposure.When you say you artificially tan at home for 1 minute, how?

          "content": "You might be interested in the British history of Vitamin D supplementation. It all started with kids in the cities getting rickets because the pollution (smog) was that bad that they never got to see further than a metre or two during the worst of it. The way to get around was by taking the tram as that had rails to guide it through the 'pea soupers'.So they put the kids on trains and took them off to the seaside.But then...The railway also allowed milk to be brought into the cities. So they added vitamin D to milk. That was how the rickets was solved. In time milk became free at school, usually it was warm by morning break, which was when it would get consumed, from mini-milk bottles, that would get reused.I am only piecing together this history, no definitive source, unless you include my elderly neighbour. However, food history is fascinating, once you get away from celebrated brands to the unsung heroes of the vegetable aisle.What I can't work out is why the children were so vulnerable to rickets when the adults weren't. Workers weren't being sent out to the countryside or beach to get some sun, just the kids. Rickets doesn't affect adults with grown bones, in theory, the adults should have had really painful joints and osteoporosis, but maybe this was not understood at the time.In time the clean air zones were setup and the smog was banished to a certain extent, by which time it became uncommon to fortify milk with vitamin D. Finally we had Margaret Thatcher, famously the 'milk snatcher', for stopping free school milk.In the UK we do get vitamin D randomly added to processed foods (what else?) and this is a scattergun approach to fortifying the population. If you don't eat processed foods then you are not going to get any of that processed food fortification goodness.Then there are the animal corpse sources, as in oily fish and whatnot. If you eat any diet except for whole-food-plant-based vegan, then you are going to get vitamin D either through dead animal or fortification. Vegetarians just have to eat maaassivve blocks of cheese, which they will, with a few eggs and some breakfast cereal to get their vitamin D needs roughly covered. Junk-food vegans should get some vitamin D goodness from fortifications too, particularly if they consume things like 'oat milk' (as if oats have mammary glands). Pure junk food, a.k.a. 'Standard American Diet', should also be pretty good for vitamin D.So this only really leaves the whole-food, plant-based, everything-cooked-from-scratch vegan diet as lacking, at least as far as the winter months is concerned. Was this a problem historically? I don't think so. Since people used to work the fields, they had plenty of vitamin D to carry over for winter.Before we had 'modern day racism' in the UK, we had a situation where the aristocracy had white skin and everyone else had leathery brown skin, from working outside. White skin was proof that you didn't have to work the fields and therefore, you were higher status. Racism pre-dated racism, if you get my drift, it was mere class-based xenophobia back then. To be 'truly white' you had to have no tan.Since meat was hard to come by, peasants were 95% vegan by default, yet working the fields, so vitamin D deficiency was not a problem, for the 1% aristocracy (since they had their oily fish, red meat and dairy) or for the 99% that had to spend lots of time outdoors.I am not sure where you are coming from regarding the Gulf Stream and cereals. The Fertile Crescent was where farming began for Europe, with wheat not actually growing in the UK and other grains (barley) being the chosen grain. It was only with the Norman Conquest that wheat made it to the UK.When the Romans made it to the UK they were perplexed at what they found. There were two tribes, the nomadic cattle types and the hill fort living grain growers that were not nomadic. The hill forts got in the way of the migration routes between pastures. The Romans were disgusted by the milk drinking since nobody would do that in Rome, where everyone was lactose intolerant, unlike the Celts.",

They care about the illusion of safety. As long as people have the illusion that they're being kept safe - the farce known as the Online Safety Bill being a great example - they'll tolerate any injustice.Honestly, I'd recommend downloading software like Signal, Session, VeraCrypt, etc. as well as making a Linux USB stick now (especially since countries like the UK wants Red Star OS levels of snooping) because this is honestly going to get much, much worse...",

Things like issuing death threats, assassinations, or burning down parliament buildings. To state what I hope is already obvious - this is not an endorsement of violence. For one Japan's history of 'government by assassination' was incredibly ugly and helped lead to extremism which helped lead to Imperial Japan's conduct becoming notorious as they did.There are other far more peaceful options to be considered but they would require high degrees of coordination and agreement. For an example, the classic Amish shunning - if legislatures faced utter social ostracism for their attempts then they would be unlikely to attempt it again.I'm not sure what policies could even provoke such extreme responses as those listed (violent or otherwise) in the first place, but for better or worse Chat Control isn't one of them.

          "content": "Copy/paste from a previous thread [0]:We’ve done some fairly extensive testing internally recently and found that Garage is somewhat easier to deploy in comparison to our existing use of MinIO, but is not as performant at high speeds. IIRC we could push about 5 gigabits of (not small) GET requests out of it, but something blocked it from reaching the 20-25 gigabits (on a 25g NIC) that MinIO could reach (also 50k STAT requests/s, over 10 nodes)I don’t begrudge it that. I get the impression that Garage isn’t necessarily focussed on this kind of use case.---In addition:Next time we come to this we are going to look at RustFS [1], as well as Ceph/Rook [2].We can see we're going to have to move away from MinIO in the foreseeable future. My hope is that the alternatives get a boost of interest given the direction MinIO is now taking.[0]: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46140342[1]: https://rustfs.com/[2]: https://rook.io/",

But it’s hard to take a project’s docs seriously when it describes Rust as “the world’s most popular memory-safe language”. Java, JavaScript, Python, even C# - these all blow it out of the water in popularity and are unambiguously memory safe.

Users have reported that when using the LMDB database engine (the default), database files have a tendency of becoming corrupted after an unclean shutdown (e.g. a power outage), so you should take regular snapshots to be able to recover from such a situation.It seems like you can also use SQLite, but a default database that isn't robust against power failure or crashes seems suprising to me.",

It also makes automating it harder, in case of minio you can pre-generate key and pass then fed it to clients and to the minio key command, here you have to do the dance of \"generate with tool\" -> \"scrape and put into DB\" -> put onto clients.Overall I like the software a lot but if you have setup that uses those features, beware.",

With 1 crashed node, the cluster is still fully functional. With 2 crashed nodes, the cluster is unavailable until at least one additional node is recovered, but no data is lost.In other words, Garage makes a very precise promise to its users, which is fully respected. Database corruption upon power loss enters in the definition of a \"crash state\", similarly to a node just being offline due to an internet connection loss. We recommend making metadata snapshots so that recovery of a crashed node is faster and simpler, but it's not required per se: Garage can always start over from an empty database and recover data from the remaining copies in the cluster.To talk more about concrete scenarios: if you have 3 replicas in 3 different physical locations, the assumption of at-most one crashed node is pretty reasonable, it's quite unlikely that 2 of the 3 locations will be offline at the same time. Concerning data corruption on a power loss, the probability to lose power at 3 distant sites at the exact same time with the same data in the write buffers is extremely low, so I'd say in practice it's not a problem.Of course, this all implies a Garage cluster running with 3-way replication, which everyone should do.",

Obviously these are carefully chosen Ruby snippets to highlit its unique abilities in strings, \"array math\" and classes. On the string interpolation, I would say that Raku has the slight edge (and has the whole Q-slang for a lot of fine grained control). On the array math, I had to apply the (built in) Raku set diff operator ... so I guess that Ruby is a little more natural for this (rather quirky) feature. On the class stuff, again very close. Raku has much more powerful OO under the hood ... multi-inheritance, role-composition, punning, mixins, MOP, and yet is a delight to use in this lightweight way.",

What other people, real or imaginary, do and think and feel – or have done and thought and felt; or might do and think and feel – is an essential guide to our understanding of what we ourselves are and may become… A person who had never listened to nor read a tale or myth or parable or story, would remain ignorant of his own emotional and spiritual heights and depths, would not know quite fully what it is to be human. For the story – from Rumpelstiltskin to War and Peace – is one of the basic tools invented by the mind of man, for the purpose of gaining understanding. There have been great societies that did not use the wheel, but there have been no societies that did not tell stories.”Engaging with fantasy and scifi helps us understand ourselves and the world around us.

          "content": "What Le Guin is expressing is a beautiful idea, but it is a false beauty. It feels like truth because it aligns with how narrative engages the human mind, not because it accurately explains what stories are or why they exist. The sense that fiction reveals destiny, inner depth, or essential humanity is an illusion created by evolved cognitive machinery, not evidence of genuine insight.From an evolutionary and cognitive standpoint, imaginative fiction is not a privileged tool for understanding who we are. It is a byproduct of more basic adaptations. The human brain evolved as a prediction engine optimized for survival in social groups. Its primary function is to anticipate outcomes, model other agents, and reduce uncertainty well enough to reproduce. Narrative arises because the brain naturally organizes experience into causal sequences involving agents, not because stories convey deeper truths about the self.Fiction works by hijacking the same neural systems used for social reasoning, memory, and planning. When reading a story, the mind runs simulations of social situations. This feels like insight, but feeling insight is not the same as acquiring accurate models of reality. Fantasy and science fiction are not special forms of wisdom. They are simply inputs that exaggerate certain variables, making simulations emotionally vivid rather than epistemically reliable.Le Guin’s claim that someone without stories would be ignorant of their emotional or spiritual depths is not supported by biology. Emotions are not learned through narrative. They are innate regulatory systems shaped by natural selection. Fear, attachment, anger, desire, and joy exist prior to language and independently of story exposure. Stories can name, frame, or intensify these states, but they do not create or deepen them in any fundamental sense.The universality of storytelling also does not imply that it is an adaptive route to understanding. Evolution does not favor truth or self knowledge. It favors fitness. Many of the most persistent stories humans tell are systematically false. Myths, religious narratives, romantic ideals, and national legends endure because they exploit cognitive biases like agency detection, pattern completion, and emotional salience. Their spread demonstrates susceptibility, not insight.Fantasy and science fiction do not teach us to imagine better worlds. They teach us to imagine compelling ones. A narrative can feel profound while being completely disconnected from reality. Inspiration and accuracy are orthogonal. The persuasive power of stories comes from their alignment with evolved psychological vulnerabilities, not from their correspondence with truth.So the correct technical framing is this. Stories are not tools invented to gain understanding of humanity or destiny. They are artifacts produced by brains shaped for survival under uncertainty. They can be pleasurable, motivating, or culturally stabilizing. They can sometimes illuminate patterns of behavior. But their beauty should not be confused with truth. The feeling of depth they produce is an illusion, not a discovery.",

          "content": "An aside that I do want to mention here because it is a really unique way for many people to interface with LLMs: many commenters mention the model over indexing on a few comments they made that do not necessarily reflect of the broader themes of their writing. This is not any issue in the author’s engineering but an inherent issue in LLMs. The reason it is so noticeable in this case is because the subject matter is extremely familiar to the user: themselves.LLMs consistently misrepresent information in this exact same way in, more critical applications. Because they are often employed on datasets that engineers and potentially end users are not deeply familiar with, the results often seem exceptional.Disclaimer via my HN wrapped: \n“The Anti LLM Manifesto\nYou will write a 5,000-word blog post on why a single Bayesian prior is more 'sentient' than GPT-6, and it will be ignored because the summary was generated by a 3B parameter model.”",

A roast works because the roaster has clearly spent time and effort and care understanding the person roasted. This is way too shallow for that.The 2026 and 2035 predictions (with a few exceptions) don't make sense at all, and the jokes in them fall completely flat. They're not good anti-jokes either. If someone said something like it in a social situation it would be followed by an awkward silence.The vibe check and the time spent were really cool though. Super interesting. I would have loved to see those expanded.I don't mean to be negative. The project is cool. I just wish it would put its focus on the valuable parts, rather than the things it is weak at.

          "content": "If you’re not familiar with Tim Ferriss, you should know that there is always more to the story than the narrative he shares. He’s one of the most charismatic and charming writers and podcasters out there and has a strong ability to build trust through his writing. However, he also has a long history of stretching the truth and spinning history in his favor, often by omitting important facts.One example: His 4 Hour Work Week book really was on the New York Times Best Seller list for a long time like he brags about in this post, but he has also bragged in other contexts about all of the manipulation and engineering (including mass purchasing books to artificially inflate sales numbers) that goes into gaming the New York Times Best Seller List.On the topic of being famous, he’s not typically famous like a celebrity. He built his career around being a self-help guru who will bring you the secrets to success in business, life, relationships, and even cooking. He’s talked about how he selects his writing topics based on how to present solutions for people’s inner desires, like financial freedom or impressing people for dating success. He puts himself at the center of these writings, presenting himself as the conduit for these revelations. He was even early in social media and blogging and experimented with social media engagements and paid events where you get to come hang out with Tim Ferriss and learn his secrets, encouraging his fans to idolize him and his wisdom dispensing abilities.So his relationship with his fans isn’t typical fame in the style of a celebrity or actor. He’s more of an early self-help guru who embraced social media and blogging early on. His experience with uncomfortable fan obsessions is therefore probably on the next level, but not exactly typical fame.EDIT to add why I know this: Tim Ferriss literally wrote the book on how to abuse remote work. His Four Hour Work Week book encourages readers to talk their boss into working remote then to outsource their work to low paid overseas assistants so they have more time to travel the world. It encourages things like setting up an e-mail auto responder and only responding to your coworkers once a week whine you’re “working remote” and setting up your own side job while traveling the world. If you’ve ever had a remote work job get ruined by people abusing it, chances are good that those people had read a Tim Ferriss book somewhere along the way.",

The quote he opens the article does not surprise me at all - his books come across as if he really wants fame and is speaking to an audience who similarly needs to be smarter, more clever, richer, more loved.However, I don't think this is unique to Tim Ferriss.  I think this is the dynamic behind fame itself.  People who are really secure in their worth don't spend their time looking for casual external validation from strangers, and they also don't spend their emotional energy idolizing strangers and distant figures.  They spend it on their family and close friends, and seek it in return from those same people.It's been interesting watching myself drop out of the popular discourse as I got more secure in myself and more inclined to spend time, money, and energy close to home.  Pop culture isn't made for us, because who got time for that shit?  Crass consumerism isn't made for us, because we don't spend money on things we don't need in an effort to feel better about ourselves.  Most of the transactions that make modern America go don't make us go, because, well, if you're happy with yourself then why do you need them?But I'm glad I realized that before getting famous.  Because there was a time, in my teens and twenties, when I wanted nothing more than to be adored by the masses.  And like Tim Ferriss says, there isn't always a reset button where you can suddenly become un-famous if it becomes too much of a drag.",

The first is the NetHack roguelike community, and the second is the fan community of a German internet broadcaster that has existed, in one form or another, for about 25 years.On average, I’d say both communities are equally kind and welcoming. I’d also argue that both contain roughly the same proportion of people who are unhinged and tend to go way over the top. The difference lies in how they go over the top.In the NetHack community, you have people who start and immediately abandon 200,000 games during a tournament because they’re trying to roll the ideal starting conditions for a very specific playstyle. Then there are the Bobby Fischer types who create their own ultra-hard forks of the game because vanilla NetHack is too easy for them. There’s also plenty of criticism. Not everyone is happy with everything, but it’s mostly civil. The worst you usually get is something like, “The dev team sucks; they ruined the game with their latest changes.”By contrast, in the internet broadcaster’s community there’s a very toxic minority that claims to have stopped watching years ago, yet continues to hate on the creators because the channel took a direction they didn’t like. Employees get mobbed and bullied, everything is torn down, and there’s a concerted effort to ruin the fun for everyone else.I mean, I can understand that if you spent your formative teenage years “with” these people, it really hurts when that influence disappears. But can a parasocial relationship really go that far, that you drift into this kind of behavior?How can someone be so hurt that they hold a grudge for years, keep hate-watching the creators, and invest so much time and energy into such a destructive hobby?",

Weird. I was pleased to be able to turn the corner and \"disappear\", as it were.I also had conversations about this with colleagues who were, let's say, well-known (but not even close to globally famous), and the shit they had to put up with was, if anything worse than described in the article - particularly when (this is theatre and independent film we're talking about) their profile didn't come with the income that could support, say, private security, or a secluded property. They were doing what they were doing in order to work on interesting projects with interesting people - and the ability to assure that was their favorite \"perk\" of their profile - and the \"occupational hazard\" framing comes from them.Another (very not-famous, though you're almost guaranteed to have seen them in a supporting role in something they've done) person I worked with a couple of times has a globally \"you know their face, at least\" famous spouse, who got that way because they're an immensely talented and committed artist; someone I've admired for years. I never met that person, because a) they'd have had to deal with a lot of hassle getting into the theatre, and b) their presence would have been an overwhelming distraction from the (interesting, but low-profile) piece we were doing.Fame is not something any well-adjusted person should wish for, and I have a good deal of sympathy for the people who seem to be destabilized by that level of attention.",

The numerous problems with this should be obvious.> I struggle to think there is a company in the world where this kind of behavior would fly, but if there is then they must be satisfied with the work (or lack thereof I guess)That’s the thing about most Tim Ferriss advice: Much of it is fanciful and unrealistic. The takeaway isn’t literally that you should be responding to email once a week, it’s that you need to be pushing the limits of how much you can get away with not responding to things and ignoring conversations with your coworkers. The email autoresponder is held up as a North Star ideal of what you’re trying to do: Hide from work and avoid contributing to the team you’re on.As for companies being happy with it: They’re generally not! The story in the book is to gradually push the limits of what you can get away with. It suggests working extra hard when you know your boss is watching and doing things like sandbagging your productivity before you go remote.

On something like a paintball marker the burst disc (i.e. emergency blow off valve) for a CO2 tank is in the range of of 1500-1800PSI [0].A compressed air tank that has a 62cubic inch, 3000PSI capacity, will have a circumference of 29cm and a length close to 32.7cm, compared to a 20oz CO2 tank that has a circumfrence of 25.5cm and a length of around 26.5cm [1]. The 20oz tank also weighs about as much 'filled' as the Compressed air tank does empty (although compressed air doesn't weigh much, just being through here).And FWIW, that 62/3000 compressed air vs 20oz CO2 comparison... the 20oz of CO2 will almost certainly give you more 'work' for a full tank. When I was in the sport you needed more like a 68/4500 tank to get the same amount of use between fills.Due to CO2's lower pressures and overall behavior, it's way cheaper and easier to handle parts of this; I'm willing to bet the blowoff valve setup could in fact even direct back to the 'bag' in this case, since the bag can be designed pessimistically for the pressure of CO2 under the thermal conditions. [2]I think the biggest 'losses' will be in the energy around re-liquifying the CO2, but if the system is closed loop that's not gonna be that bad IMO. CO2's honestly a relatively easy and as long as working in open area or with a fume hood relatively safe gas to work with, so long as you understand thermal rules around liquid state [also 2] and use proper safety equipment (i.e. BOVs/burst discs/etc.)[0] - I know there are 3k PSI burst discs out there but I've never seen one that high on a paintball CO2 tank...[1] - I used the chart on this page as a reference: https://www.hkarmy.com/products/20oz-aluminum-co2-paintball-...[2] - Liquid CO2 does not like rapid thermal changes or sustained extreme heat; This is when burst discs tend to go off. But it also does not work nearly as well in cold weather, especially below freezing. Where this becomes an issue is when for one reason or another liquid CO2 gets into the system.

It's a simplified model, but it provides important insights.Go there, and (for various locations) try it with and without the hydrogen.  You'll find that in a place at highish lattitude, like (say) Germany, omitting hydrogen doubles the cost.   That's because to either smooth over seasonal variation in solar, or over long period drop out of wind, you need to either greatly overprovision those, or greatly overprovision batteries.  Just a little hydrogen reduces the needed overprovisioning of those other things, even with hydrogen's lousy round trip efficiency.Batteries are still extremely important here, for short duration smoothing.  Most stored energy is still going through batteries, so their capex and efficiency is important.You can also tweak the model to allow a little natural gas, limiting it to some fixed percentage (say, 5%) of total electrical output.  This also gets around the problem.  But we utimately want to totally get off of natural gas.I suspect thermal storage will beat out hydrogen, if Standard Thermal's \"hot dirt\" approach pans out.",

      "abstract": "该讨论围绕弦理论近50年发展展开，核心争议在于其科学有效性及预测能力。有人认为弦理论的问题并非无法做出预测，而是其数学框架过于灵活，几乎可以适配任何预测结果，因此更像一个数学构造工具而非严格物理理论。也有用户指出，弦理论早期曾做出具体预测，但后续计算证明这些预测错误，研究者不得不反复放宽约束条件，引发对其科学严谨性的质疑。讨论中提到，实验验证是主要障碍，因为弦理论的特征物理尺度远超当前加速器能力（如LHC能量低15个数量级），短期内无法通过实验检验。部分用户对弦理论持讽刺态度，称其为“工作保障框架”，或质疑研究者若投身其他领域是否更有建树。共识在于，实验验证的极端困难是弦理论面临的根本挑战，但社区对其科学价值的评价存在明显分歧。",

So today it's that framework that you can use to write any theory you want.That original theory was a good theory. Very compelling and just a small adjustment away from mainstream physics.

          "content": "I have a PhD in high energy theoretical physics (hep-th for short) and I've written a paper on string theory, so I'd like to comment on some things:1. I think there are two reasons why string theory is cool (other people may have different opinions). Please note that none of these two reasons are directly related to the extension of Standard Model.\n1.1. String theory is the only theory so far that can mix gravity and quantum mechanics, and it can be even used to derive Hawking entropy of a black hole from \"first principles\" (see paper by Strominger and Vafa). The obvious trouble is that the black hole in question lives in five-dimensional space and is unrelated to the real-world black holes, but this is way better than what one can get from Standard Model physics (which is, no gravitons for you).1.2. Through AdS/CFT correspondence, string theory can be used to describe quantum field theories that are not related to string theory by themselves. This gives a very strong tool to study these quantum field theories, and the paper by Maldacena that discovered this correspondence is one of the most important papers in the field.2. It is true string theory is unusable as of now to derive the Standard Model physics (and provide extensions for it). Unfortunately, I would say that hardly any papers in high energy _theoretical_ physics currently address Standard Model physics. Roughly speaking, in late 1970s, after quantum chromodynamics was established and the asymptotic freedom was discovered, it turned out that it is extremely hard to compute many things we are generally interested in. At this point, high energy theoretical physics split in two sub-areas: phenomenology (which tries to extend the Standard Model to derive things like neutrino mass) and theory (which is a more formal theory and tries to answer questions like \"how to quantize gravity\"). One can argue that this makes hep-th an area of mathematics, and I would agree with that (eg in Cambridge theoretical physicists are in the same department with applied mathematicians).2.1. The things theoretical physicists study tend to pop up in various places, even if the original motivation is misplaced. Even the string theory itself originated as a way to explain the Regge trajectories (which were explained with quantum chromodynaics afterwards), and not to quantize gravity. For a more practical example, Witten introduced topological quantum field theories long before anyone understood how to apply them to real-world physics.3. I do not agree that string theory dominates the hep-th field. I would say that its popularity changes with the time, going up and down. While the main conference in the hep-th field is called \"Strings\", the talks at it are not necessarily related to strings theory, and at the 2025 conference I'd say that only 1/3 of the talks were anyhow related to the strings theory. Moreover, there is no hard division between people working on string theory and people working on other hep-th subjects, so that e.g. Witten made many contributions to hep-th which are not anyhow related to string theory.3.1. As for the push to do string theory that eg Sabine Hossenfelder alludes to, I'd say that I experienced no such push during my MSc and PhD studies. I've written four papers, and worked on a couple of projects that did not become a paper, and out of those, only one was dedicated to string theory.3.2. On the other hand, the more fringe theories that can provide alternative to string theory are also more high-risk endeavors (as you are quite likely to fail to produce anything coherent within a typical timeframe you allot to write a paper). Hep-th is strongly underfunded, and I believe, that with greater funding (and less need to publish-or-perish) some people would also pursue the more fringe directions in hep-th.3.3. A comment on the naming: hep-th is a field which is very hard to name. The name I use is the traditional one (and is used as eg a name for the field on arXiv). However, many things derived by the physicists in the field are not anyhow related to the high energy in the literal meaning of the words \"high energy\". When talking to people at a party, I say that I studied string theory, because the name is catchy and it rings a bell, but this way of referring to the field is definitely a misnomer.",

But the idea is not that experiments of unimaginable scale and complexity might reveal that the universe is made up of strings or something, it's just that it may turn out that string theory makes up such a rich and flexible family of theories that it could be tuned to the observed physics of some unimaginably advanced civilization. My impression is that string theory is not so flexible that its uninteresting though.

(Which might sound like a weird justification if you are not aware of all the other aspects of physics which get explained as resonances of fields; this is a standard sort of justification which there's a lot of good reasons to be interested in, at least initially.)",

You can picture a tube that vibrates, or has waves in its cross-section. Don't think of the the \"strings\" as actual little loops moving around in space, they're a modification of what space is.You can even do the same kind of line->tube extension of a space with even more extra \"loop\" dimensions than the number of base dimensions. AFAIK the current theories have 10 total, of which 3 are the usual \"large\" dimensions of space, the rest are \"small\" and rolled up like the tube example.",

          "content": "I applaud your efforts, but that seems difficult to me.  There's so much nuance in language, and the original spanish translation would even be dependent upon locale-destination of the original dictionary.  Which would also be time based, as language changes over time.And that translation is likely only a rough approximation, as words don't often translate directly.  To add in an extra layer (spanish -> english) seems like another layer of imperfect (due to language) abstraction.Of course your efforts are targeting a niche, so likely people will understand the attempt and be thankful.  I hope this suggestion isn't too forward, but this being an electronic version, you could allow some way for the original spanish to be shown if desired.  That sort of functionality would be quite helpful, even non-native spanish speakers might get a clearer picture.What tools are you using to abstract all of this?If the spacing and columns of the images are consistent, I'd think imagemagick would allow you to automate extraction by column (eg, cutting the individual pages up), and OCR could then get to work.For the Shipibo side, I'd want to turn off all LLM interpretation.  That tends to use known groupings of words to probabilistically determine best-match, and that'd wreak havoc in this case.Back to the images, once you have imagemagick chop and sort, writing a very short script to iterate over the pages, display them, and prompt with y/n would be a massive time saver.  Doing so at each step would be helpful.For example, one step?  Cut off header and footer, save to dir.  Using helpful naming conventions (page-1, and page-1-noheader_footer).  You could then use imagemagick to combine page-1 and -age-1-noheader_footer side by side.Now run a simple bash vet script.  Each of 500 pages pops up, you instantly see the original and the cut result, and you hit y or n.  One could go through 500 pages like this in 10 to 20 minutes, and you'd be left with a small subset of pages that didn't get cut properly (extra large footer or whatever).  If it's down to 10 pages or some such, that's an easy tweak and fix for those.Once done, you could do the same for column cuts.  You'd already have all the scripts, so it's just tweaking.I'm mentioning all of this, because combo of automation plus human intervention is often the best method to something such as this.Anyhow, good luck!",

Good for a rough search at least).I would love to create a json version of it that would essentially have a bunch of fields for each word (Shipibo/Spanish/English word/definition/example, type of word, etc). It's further complicated by how words can be modified in Shipibo (it's actually a very technical language- words can have any number of prefixes and suffixes tagged on to change their meaning and their precision. In their \"icaros\", the healing songs they sing in ceremony, the most technical use of the language is considered to be the most beautiful. Essentially poetry from their \"medical\" jargon).I've done some human-in-the-loop attempts but still come up short in one way or another (I end up getting frustrated and throwing my hands up after seeing how much time I dump on it).

You can run a Pi 5 with a high-end GPU via external enclosure and get 90% of the performance of a full workstation at a fraction of the power draw and cost.The multi-GPU results make sense too - without tensor parallelism, you're just pipeline parallelism across layers, which is inherently sequential. The GPUs are literally sitting idle waiting for the previous layer's output.

Reportedly the inter-layer transfer sizes are in kilobyte ranges and PCIe x1 is plenty or something.It takes appropriate backends with \"tensor parallel\" mode support, which splits the neural network parallel to the direction of flow of data, which also obviously benefit substantially from good node interconnect between GPUs like PCIe x16 or NVlink/Infinity Fabric bridge cables, and/or inter-GPU DMA over PCIe(called GPU P2P or GPUdirect or some lingo like that).Absent those, I've read somewhere that people can sometimes see GPU utilization spikes walking over GPUs on nvtop-style tools.Looking for a way to break up tasks for LLMs so that there will be multiple tasks to run concurrently would be interesting, maybe like creating one \"manager\" and few \"delegated engineers\" personalities.

It would pass the MB boundary with just a little over 200 tokens.

Or you could even have a forest of GPU cores with a few CPU cores interspersed among them - sort of like how modern FPGAs have logic tiles, memory tiles and CPU tiles spread out on it. I doubt it would be called a GPU at that point.",

The CPU and VDP \"shared\" the memory, but only because CPUs were slow enough to make that possible.We have had the opposite problem for 35+ years at this point. The newer architecture machines like the Apple machines, the GB10, the AI 395+ do share memory between GPU and CPU but in a different way, I believe.I'd argue with memory becoming suddenly much more expensive we'll probably see the opposite trend. I'm going to get me one of these GB10 or Strix Halo machines ASAP because I think with RAM prices skyrocketing we won't be seeing more of this kind of thing in the consumer market for a long time.

I have faced my fair share too. But life teaches you ever bigger lessons and shifts your priorities. There are much bigger problems now! But if you had the luxury of harboring your grudges against some kiddie bullies, then you have some serious insecurity problems and too much time in your hands. In fact, that's exactly the problem that convert some shy rich kids into destructive oligarchs who lack any empathy. They end up with the delusions that they're somehow special, extra-intelligent and the rightful heirs to the future of humanity. They see their former bullies as sub-human creatures who stand in the way of their and humanity's glory.I'm not making this up. Go ahead and read the literature that guide these techno-authoritarians. You'll see this philosophy repeated time and again. If you don't want to put in that much effort, there are numerous articles and media that psychoanalyze them based on these literature. You can see that fingerprint in all of their destructive behavior, including their disdain for democracy. And then check your own comment. See how much it resembles them!",

      "content_cn": "我拿到了苹果开发者证书，并构建了一个简单的应用来解决我遇到的一个问题。我常光顾的一家店铺没有苹果钱包通行证。由于构建这些非常简单的功能需要签名证书，我创建了一个极简应用来为它们签名。如果你也需要，这个应用可供使用。它不会用AI扫描卡片——你需要手动输入条形码，我认为这样更不容易出错。",
      "abstract": "该帖子展示了开发者自建的WalletWallet工具，用于将任意条形码生成Apple Wallet通行证。核心话题围绕如何简化Apple Wallet通行证的创建流程，并探讨了相关功能需求与限制。\n\n社区普遍认可该工具的实用性，尤其赞赏其手动输入条形码以避免AI识别错误的做法。多数用户认为这解决了商家未提供官方通行证的不便，并希望增加更多功能，如基于地理位置自动弹出通行证、在条形码下方显示会员号码以便电话核对等。\n\n争议点主要集中在隐私与开源方面。有用户指出工具虽声称在浏览器中运行，但仍需网络连接，引发对数据安全的担忧；另一些用户则强调需要开源代码才愿意信任使用。同时，讨论中提到Apple对通行证签名的严格流程被与Google Wallet的内置功能对比，被认为增加了不必要的复杂度。此外，也有用户反映部分旧格式条形码（如Codebar）无法兼容，且现有工具存在收费问题。",

Likewise, when I’m about to board a flight, I don’t want random loyalty cards to clutter the interface.At the same time, I would really like to keep these occasional cards and passes in Wallet, just not on the main screen.

Finding and reading barcodes is a reasonably mature technology that has existed long before AI.Barcodes exist as a fast, machine readable data transfer format meant to avoid data entry errors by avoiding manual data entry, and yet you've implemented manual entry in order to avoid errors?Now, if one of the constraints you've put on your implementation is that it work only in the browser and you don't want to have to download a large barcode scanning library to the browser, then it makes sense to implement manual entry. But that has nothing to do with AI.That being said, there are some barcode reading apps that can be used to prompt for a scan from a web page, and you get the barcode payload back. I've used an app called \"bineye\" on Android (source on GitHub) that works like this.

With the maximum reasoning effort it's able to break out of the wrong route by rethinking the strategy.

All reasoning models including Gemini 2.5 and 3 assume it's a puzzle or a cipher (because they're trained on those) and start endlessly applying different algorithms to no avail. Gemini 3 Pro is the only model that can break the initial assumption after running out of ideas (\"Wait, the user said it's just a string, what if it's NOT obfuscated\"), and correctly identify the string as an onion address. My guess is they trained it on simulations to enforce the anti-jailbreaking commands injected by the Model Armor, as its CoT is incredibly paranoid at times. I could be wrong, of course.",

On Black Friday, you could get a Pixel 10 Pro for about $450 on the U.S. Google Fi store (which sells unlocked phones)... which is also about how much a Pixel 9 Pro goes for on eBay; minus eBay fees and accounting for shipping, that's an upgrade for < $100. But, it's even better, the Pixel 10 Pro comes with a year of their \"AI Pro\" plan (which I believe costs around $240/year.) There is really, really no point in upgrading to a Pixel 10 Pro from a Pixel 9 Pro, and environmentally it pains me to be the person upgrading my phone on an annual basis (this is the fastest I've ever upgraded a phone, ever) but it's hard to turn down when Google is selling $800~ish for $400~ish.And yeah, it's not the insanely priced AI Ultra plan, but if there are any hard limits on Gemini Pro usage I haven't found them. I have played a lot with really long Antigravity sessions to try to figure out what this thing is good for, and it seems like it will pretty much sit there and run all day. (And I can't really blame anyone for still remaining mad about AI to be completely honest, but the technology is too neat by this point to just completely ignore it.)Seeing as Google is still giving away a bunch of free access, I'm guessing they're still in the ultra-cash-burning phase of things. My hope (hopium, realistically) is that by the time all of the cash burning is over, there will be open-weight local models that are striking near where Gemini 3 Pro strikes today. It doesn't have to be as good, getting nearby on hardware consumers can afford would be awesome.But I'm not holding my breath, so let's hope the cash burning continues for a few years.(There is, of course, the other way to look at it, which is that looking at the pricing per token may not tell the whole story. Given that Google is running their own data centers, it's possible the economic proposition isn't as bad as it looks. OTOH, it's also possible it is worse than it looks, if they happen to be selling tokens at a loss... but I quite doubt it, given they are currently SOTA and can charge a premium.)",

Some categories had more of a business focus but most were science/engineering related. The 3D CAD one was pretty fun. I recall two parts. In the first half, you got a hand-drawn sketch of a bushing and had to recreate it in Autodesk Inventor as fast as possible and then generate a 2D drawing properly dimensioned (like what you'd hand to a machinist). The second half involved creating all of the parts for a basic ceiling fan and then making an animated exploded view that also spun the fan. I was really good at that stuff back then but I definitely wasn't the quickest. I'm sure it's a lot different now, so much of CAD now involved CNC and 3D printing that's there's probably aspects that include messing with gcode now.My GIS competition was fun too. They gave me a bunch of map data and I had to produce a report on Washington DC storm surge flood zones and potential rescue helicopter locations all within a couple hours.I recall there being a video production category too. I didn't compete in it but you'd be given props and dialogue to turn into a video over the course of a day or two.

My experience with trying “vibecoding” style app development, even with highly detailed design documents and even providing test case expected output, has felt like lighting tokens on fire at a phenomenal rate.

I recently bought the $200/mo OpenAI subscription but could barely use 10% of it. Now for over a month, I use codex for at least 2 hrs every day and have yet to reach the quota.With Gemini/Antigravity, there’s the added benefit of switching to Claude Code Opus 4.5 once you hit your Gemini quota, and Google is waaaay more generous than Claude. I can use Opus alone for the entire coding session. It is bonkers.So having subscribed to all three at their lowest subscriptions (for $60/mo) I get the best of each one and never run out of quota. I’ve also got a couple of open-source model subscriptions but I’ve barely had the chance to use them since Codex and Gemini got so good (and generous).The fact that OpenAI is only spending 30% of their revenue on servers and inference despite being so generous is just mind boggling to me. I think the good times are likely going to last.My advise - get Gemini + Codex lowest tier subscriptions. Add some credits to your codex subscription in case you hit the quota and can’t wait. You’ll never be spending over $100 even if you’re building complex apps like me.",
